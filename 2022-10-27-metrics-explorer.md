Weâ€™ve enhanced the [Metrics Explorer](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer/) to make metric query results easier to interpret. Now, you can define Warning and Critical threshold values for query results. When you do that, your chart view will be color-coded so you can easily spot out-of-threshold behavior. For more information see Set [Warning and Critical Thresholds](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer/#set-warning-and-critical-thresholds).
