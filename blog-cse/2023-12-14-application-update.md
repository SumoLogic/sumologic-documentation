### Minor changes and enhancements

* [New] A new attribute section has been added to Signal and Insight details returned by the API endpoints `GET /signals/{id}` and `GET /insights/{id}`. The section will include the log search string (along with start and end times) that you can use to retrieve the queried records for a given Signal. The stanza looks like this:

    ```
    "recordSearchDetails": {
      "query": "{string}",
      "queryStartTime": "{timestamp}",
      "queryEndTime": "{timestamp}"
    },
    ```

### Bug fixes

* Some users were seeing duplicate schema tags (with an extra "s" at the end) in the UI.
* In some scenarios, the UI would react slowly when users attempted to enter comments for Insights.
* The UI was not properly enforcing the 100 character limit for rule names (and instead displaying an unknown error if the user attempted to set a rule name that was too long).
