* This Content Release Includes:
    - New rules to assist in detection of the ToolShell exploit against Microsoft SharePoint Server (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-53771) and other web shell attack activity
    - Updates to rules
    - Parsing support for Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) logging
        - Designed to support AWS Security Hub Findings via OCSF, but broadly compatible with other OCSF data sources.
    - Mapping support for AWS Security Hub Findings via OCSF.
        - AWS Security Hub via OCSF mapping support includes mappers which can be easily cloned and repurposed to support additional sources of data which use OCSF. Not all OCSF categories and classes are necessarily pertinent to AWS Security Hub data produced at this time.
        - Additional mappers for OCSF data sources will be added in future releases.
    - Updates to AWS Security Hub (non-OCSF) mapper to reduce signal volume by using a less granular field for `threat_signalName` and to map general resources into `resource` field.
    - New mappers for Citrix NetScaler and Palo Alto Firewall events
    - Updates to existing mappers/parsers for AWS, Azure, Citrix NetScaler, Linux Sysmon, Windows Sysmon, and Zscaler to support additional events and field mappings
    - Allows `resource` to be used as an entity in rules
    - Other changes are enumerated below


## Rules
- [New] MATCH-S01050 IIS - Executable File Added to Directory
    - Executable files added to Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) directories can indicate the installation of a web shell by an attacker. For example, the ToolShell exploit (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-53771) included the installation of spinstall10.aspx in an executable directory
- [New] MATCH-S01051 SharePoint Server ToolShell Exploitation (CVE-2025-53770, CVE-2025-53771)
    - Exploits against two vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint server, CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771, are combined to execute code on Microsoft SharePoint without authentication. This attack has been nicknamed "ToolShell".
- [New] MATCH-S01052 SharePoint Server ToolShell Web Shell Interaction (CVE-2025-53771)
    - Exploits against two vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint server, CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771 are combined to execute code on Microsoft SharePoint without authentication. This attack has been nicknamed "ToolShell".
- [Updated] MATCH-S00402 Normalized Security Signal
    - Adjusted summary to remove `{{device_hostname}}` to avoid `null` values for blank hostnames.
    - Added `resource` to entity selector
- [Updated] MATCH-S00061 Zscaler - Allowed Elevated Risk Score Events
    - Updated rule expression and severity score to use normalized fields
