## April 29, 2022 - Application Update

### Related Entities

[New] The Cloud SIEM Enterprise team is excited to announce a newly enhanced feature: Related Entities. Although Insights and the Signals they contain are focused on a single Entity (a user, or host for example), there are often a number of additional Entities referenced in the Records/Signals contained in the Insight. In addition, CSE can detect relationships between Entities (for example, determining that an IP address was associated with a given hostname during the Insight detection window).

To provide an easy way for analysts to explore all of these Related Entities, a new tab has been added to the Insight Details page:

The **Entities **tab contains a list of all of the Entities detected in the Insight’s Signals and Records. The Primary Entity is listed first, and then the other Related Entities are listed in descending order of appearance. Where CSE has determined a relationship between entities, that is called out (for example, 192.168.1.101 may also be hostname ‘na’).

Details listed with each entity include tags, the number of Signals the Entity was seen in, the number of recent Insights and Signals that featured that Entity, and the total sum of the Severities for those Signals.

As each Entity is selected by the user, the right column changes to show more details, such as a link to the full Entity Details page, inventory and other metadata, a Signal timeline, and a list of the recent Signals and Insights (containing links to those individual details pages).

This new feature should help users understand the context of security events more quickly by providing this data at a glance, reducing the amount of time it would have previously taken to gather that same information.

More information can be found in the [online documentation](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/about-cse-insight-ui#entities-tab).


### Minor Changes and Enhancements

[Update] For Signals generated by Threshold, Aggregation and Chain Rules, there is a feature called [Queried Records](/docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/view-records-signal#View-additional-Records-for-a-Signal) that enables users to find additional records that also apply to the Signal beyond those that were needed to meet the conditions for the Rule.The page that lists these Queried Records now explicitly shows the search query and time window that is being checked. If a user clicks on the query, it will open a Log Search window with the query and time window pre-filled for deeper investigation.

## April 19, 2022 - Announcement

We will be consolidating Authentication Brute Force Attempt **MATCH-S00258** on Tuesday May 10 into the normalized intrusion rule set. For more information on the normalized intrusion rule set, please visit the [help page](/docs/cse/rules/normalized-threat-rules).

---
## April 18, 2022 - Application Update

### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] API endpoints are now available to add or remove a given Signal to/from a given Insight, `PUT "/insights/<insightId>/signals"` and `DELETE "/insights/<insightId>/signals"` respectively. (For both endpoints, the request body is a list containing signal ID(s) to add or remove from the insight as the request body, the response is the updated Insight.)
* [Update] The way CSE displays group membership in Active Directory inventory objects is changing. Previously, it was displayed in LDAP form (i.e., `cn=groupname,dc=something,dc=domain,dc=com`); now it will just show the group name.

### Resolved Issues

* Signal and Insight timestamps in the Cloud SIEM Enterprise UI were not always displayed in the user’s preferred time zone.

## April 15, 2022 - Announcements

* Because it can now be connected via more standardized TAXII feeds, the integration between Cloud SIEM Enterprise and **Anomali ThreatStream** has been **deprecated** as of **April 15, 2022**. If you are using this integration, be sure to convert to a TAXII feed. To set up a feed, first follow Anomali’s documentation for [Setting up a TAXII feed for ThreatStream](https://www.anomali.com/blog/generating-your-own-threat-intelligence-feeds-in-threatstream) then Sumo Logic’s documentation for [Integrating CSE with a TAXII Feed](/docs/cse/integrations/integrate-cse-with-taxii-feed).
* The Entity API has been updated to include a new field `IsSuppressed`. This field replaces `IsWhitelisted` which has been **deprecated** as of **April 15, 2022**. If you were previously using `IsWhitelisted` please ensure you have switched to the new field.

## April 7, 2022 - Announcement

On April 21, 2022 we will be removing the following legacy log mappers related to the CIP Windows collector from the CSE platform. These log mappers are in use with only a small portion of our customer base and we are working with our technical account teams to reach out directly to those impacted and migrate to our newer Sumo parsers.

No loss of out-of-the-box functionality will occur and no out-of-the-box rules are impacted as the Sumo parsers map all of the same information. Please be sure to check any custom rules that leverage Windows logging for compatibility with the new parsing and mapping, particularly where the "fields" field is referenced.

### Upcoming Removal of Unused Content

On Tuesday, April 12th, **unused **legacy grok parsers and their corresponding log mappers will be removed from CSE.

This update is part of a longer transition as we begin decommissioning legacy grok parsers in favor of our current parser set. Sumo Logic has confirmed customers are **NOT **actively using any of the legacy grok parsers or log mappers we plan to remove in this future update.

It's important to note that this future content update does **NOT **remove or change existing legacy grok parsers or associated log mappers still used by customers today. We do not expect this update to cause any operational changes.
