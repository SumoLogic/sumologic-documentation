### New TAXII 2 Threat Intelligence Sources

We're excited to announce the following new threat intelligence sources that allow you to collect TAXII feeds with greater ease. These sources are based on the underlying code of our STIX/TAXII 2 Client Source, but are tailored for each of the vendors to facilitate setup:
* CISA TAXII Client
* Dragos TAXII Client
* Nozomi TAXII Client
* Recorded Future TAXII Client
* Unit42 TAXII Client

When you set up a source, search for "taxii" and select the tile for the source you want to install:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/security/taxii-sources.png')} alt="TAXII sources" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
