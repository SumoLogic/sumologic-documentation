### December 15, 2025 - Application Update

#### Threat Intel 471 update

We're happy to announce that the [SumoLogic_ThreatIntel source](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/about-threat-intelligence/#sumo-logic-threat-intelligence-sources) and the [Intel 471 Threat Intel Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/intel471-threat-intel-source), which incorporate threat indicators supplied by [Intel 471](https://www.intel471.com/), now include domain and email threat indicators. Now you can use these sources to identify threats based on domain URLs and email addresses.

For instructions on how to use these and other sources, see [About Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/about-threat-intelligence).

### December 10, 2025 - Application Update

#### New look for list pages

We're excited to announce a new look for list pages in Cloud SIEM. We've replaced "cards" with table rows for a simpler, cleaner appearance that more closely matches how we present data in the rest of Sumo Logic. This new presentation lets you see more at a glance, allowing you to more quickly evaluate your SIEM data.

To learn more, see our list view documentation for:
* [Insights](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/about-cse-insight-ui/#list-view)
* [Entities](/docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/view-manage-entities/#about-the-entities-list-page)

### June 12, 2025 - Content Release

This content release includes:
- New detection rules for browser extension persistence, Kerberos certificate authentication, GitHub vulnerability alerts, Okta application access monitoring, and threat intelligence email matching.
- New product support for Atlassian audit and login events.
- Enhanced Azure Event Hub Windows Defender integration with new threat event mapping for passthrough alerts.
- Cisco ASA updates with new network event support and NAT IP handling improvements.
- Citrix NetScaler mapping updates to support additional events.

- Mimecast security event mapping improvements across several event types.
- AWS CloudTrail network event enhancements with event success/failure handling and protocol support.
- Parser updates to support additional event formats for multiple platforms.

Changes are enumerated below.

#### Rules
- [New] MATCH-S00897 Chromium Extension Installed
    - Threat actors may install browser extensions as a form of persistence on victim systems. Look up the 32 character extension ID in order to ensure that the extension is valid and expected to be installed as part of normal business operations. This extension ID can be found in the following values: `file_path` and/or `changeTarget` depending on the source of the telemetry. This rule logic utilizes Sysmon file creation events, which need to be enabled and configured on relevant assets.
- [New] FIRST-S00064 First Seen Certificate Thumbprint in Successful Kerberos Authentication
    - This alert looks for a first seen certificate thumbprint being used to authenticate to an Active Directory environment, resulting in a Kerberos ticket being successfully issued. This alert is designed to catch Active Directory Certificate Services related attacks, ensure the certificate thumprint is valid, correlate the thumbprint ID with other Certificate Services events, particularly looking for recently issued templates.
- [New] MATCH-S00949 GitHub - Vulnerability Alerts
    - Detects vulnerability alerts created for a GitHub repository.
- [New] FIRST-S00070 Okta - First Seen Application Accessed by User
    - This signal looks for a user that is accessing an application behind Okta SSO that is first seen since the baseline period. Ensure that access of this application is expected and authorized, look for other Okta events around the user account in question to determine whether access to this application is expected and authorized.
- [New] AGGREGATION-S00007 Okta - Session Anomaly (Multiple Operating Systems)
    - This rule detects when a user has utilized multiple distinct operating systems when performing authentication through Okta. This activity could potentially indicate credential theft or a general session anomaly. Examine other Okta related events surrounding the time period for this signal, pivoting off the username value to examine if any other suspicious activity has taken place. If this rule is generating false positives, adjust the threshold value and consider excluding certain user accounts via tuning expression or a match list.
- [New] MATCH-S01020 Threat Intel - Matched Target Email
    - Detects email addresses associated with known malicious actor(s) or campaign(s) as designated by a threat intelligence provider.
- [New] MATCH-S01019 Threat Intel - Matched User Email
    - Detects email addresses associated with known malicious actor(s) or campaign(s) as designated by a threat intelligence provider.
- [Updated] MATCH-S00170 Windows - Scheduled Task Creation
    - Fixed spelling error.

### June 02, 2025 - Application Update

#### New method for building baselines

We're happy to announce that now when you create or update a first seen or outlier rule, the baseline starts building immediately using existing system data. Typically, the baseline is ready within minutes. You no longer need to wait days for a baseline learning period to complete before it becomes usable. This change enables you to gain insights faster and iterate on your first seen and outlier rules rapidly, reducing tuning time from weeks to minutes.

To learn more, see our information about baselines for [first seen rules](/docs/cse/rules/write-first-seen-rule/) and [outlier rules](/docs/cse/rules/write-outlier-rule/#baselines-for-outlier-rules).

:::note
This feature update applies only to new and changed first seen and outlier rules. Unchanged existing rules will continue to use their existing baselines.

### March 24, 2025 - Content Release

This content release includes Threat Intelligence match rules that use the new [`hasThreatMatch`](/docs/cse/rules/cse-rules-syntax/#hasthreatmatch) operator to support both global and custom threat intelligence feeds.

To reduce initial signal volume, basic inbound and outbound IP address threat match rules with a low or medium confidence level are disabled by default (see below). We highly recommend tuning these rules before enabling them to reduce signal volume, and therefore entity risk assignment, to manageable levels.

#### Rules
* MATCH-S00999 Threat Intel - IMPHASH Match
* MATCH-S01000 Threat Intel - MD5 Match
* MATCH-S01001 Threat Intel - PEHASH Match
* MATCH-S01002 Threat Intel - SSDEEP Match
* MATCH-S01003 Threat Intel - SHA1 Match
* MATCH-S01004 Threat Intel - SHA256 Match
* MATCH-S01005 Threat Intel - Source Hostname
* MATCH-S01006 Threat Intel - Device Hostname
* MATCH-S01007 Threat Intel - Destination Device Hostname
* MATCH-S01008 Threat Intel - HTTP Hostname
* MATCH-S01009 Threat Intel - HTTP Referrer Hostname
* MATCH-S01010 Threat Intel - DNS Query Domain
* MATCH-S01011 Threat Intel - DNS Reply Domain
* MATCH-S01012 Threat Intel - HTTP Referrer Domain
* MATCH-S01013 Threat Intel - HTTP URL Root Domain

### March 13, 2025 - Content Release

This release includes:
- New detection rules for Azure DevOps to identify suspicious or sensitive activity in CI/CD pipelines

#### Rules
- [New] CHAIN-S00022 Azure DevOps - Agent Pool Created and Deleted within a Short Period
    - This detection monitors for the creation and deletion of Agent Pools within 5 days by the same user, with the intent of finding Agent Pools active for short durations.
- [New] MATCH-S00997 Azure DevOps - Browser Observed in Personal Access Token (PAT) Use
    - This detection monitors for the use of a PAT for authentication from a User Agent String indicating a web browser.
- [New] MATCH-S00995 Azure DevOps - Change Made to Administrator Group
    - This detection monitors for additions to the following groups: Project Administrators, Project Collection Administrators, Project Collection Service Accounts, Build Administrators, Project Collection Build Administrators
- [New] FIRST-S00098 Azure DevOps - First Seen Pull Request Policy Bypassed
    - This detection monitors for when a user performs a pull request bypass for the first time.
- [New] FIRST-S00099 Azure DevOps - First Seen User Creating Agent Pool
    - This detection monitors for new users creating an agent pool. This user has not been observed creating agent pools during the baseline period and may be a new admin or involved in suspicious account activity.
- [New] FIRST-S00092 Azure DevOps - First Seen User Creating Release Pipeline
    - This detection monitors for users creating a release pipeline for the first time after the baseline period (by default, 90 days).

- [New] FIRST-S00094 Azure DevOps - New Extension Installed
    - This detection monitors for new extensions installed organization-wide after a 30-day baseline, based on the user installing the new extension.
