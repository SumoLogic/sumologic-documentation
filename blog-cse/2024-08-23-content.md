:::note
Rule DNS query for dynamic DNS provider (LEGACY-S00180) is slated for removal the week of 2024-09-02. The rule is being removed from global content due to the untenable nature of maintaining the list of dynamic DNS providers within the rule expression. To retain this rule, it must be duplicated prior to the date of removal.
