### December 13, 2022 Application Update

#### New Entity Types

Eight new predefined Entity types have been added to CSE. This will enable customers to more accurately associate Signals and Insights with security threats. They are listed below long with the related normalized record schema attributes (which can be specified in Rule definitions):

| Entity Type | Schema Attributes |
|:----- |:----- |
| Command | `commandLine` |
| Domain | `http_referer_fqdn`, `http_url_fqdn` |
| Email | `targetUser_email`, `user_email` |
| File | `file_path`, `file_basename` |
| Hash | `file_hash_imphash`, `file_hash_md5`, `file_hash_pehash`, `file_hash_sha1`, `file_hash_sha256`, `file_hash_ssdeep` |
| Process | `baseImage`, `parentBaseImage` |
| URL | `http_url` |
| User Agent | `http_userAgent` |

If you already had a custom Entity type with the same or similar name, it will not be affected and will not be automatically migrated to the corresponding standard Entity type.

#### Entity Notes

Similar to the functionality on Insights, users can now attach notes to Entities:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Notes.png')} alt="Screenshot of Entity Notes user interface"/>

These notes are retained permanently on the associated Entity and are visible to all users who can view the Entity.

#### Custom Time Windows for Rules

Threshold, Aggregation and Chain Rules now support custom time windows. Previously, when writing a Rule, a time window had to be chosen from a list of predefined options. With this new enhancement, users can define any time window defined in minutes, hours, or days, with a minimum of 1 minute and a maximum of 5 days (120 hours):

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Custom-Window-Size-For-Rules.png')} alt="Screenshot of Custom Time Window for Rules user interface"/>

#### Inventory Favorite Fields

Where inventory data is shown for an Entity, such as the Entity details page or the Insight details page, users can now “favorite” the inventory fields that should be shown in the summary list.

To do this, simply expand the **Full Details** view, hover to the left of the field, and click the star icon that appears. To remove the favorite selection, simply unclick the star icon. The field selections are applied across all users and retained across sessions. (This behavior is the same as for favorite fields on Records.)

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] The previously announced migration of our out-of-the-box rules from standard match lists to Entity tags has been postponed. New dates for this migration will be announced in the near future.
* [New] Service providers using the Consolidated Insight List can now see Insights from client organizations across deployments.
* [Updated] The usability of filters for list views when searching for an object that includes a specific tag schema has been enhanced.
* [Removed] The link to download the Insight Enrichment Service has been removed from the **Enrichment** page. The link is specified in the [installation instructions](/docs/cse/integrations/insight-enrichment-server/) online.
* [New] Users can now filter Records by Sensor Zone.

#### Resolved Issues

* Importing data from CSV files via the UI was not working properly.
* The `http_url` field was not being concatenated properly in some mapper scenarios.
* Entity domain normalization was not working properly.
* The **Copy Expression** feature in the UI did not copy Boolean values to the clipboard properly.
* The Rule Tuning Expression list page was not auto-refreshing correctly.
* Users were unable to filter the Signals list based on severity.
* IP addresses in the 198.18.0.0/15 and 169.254.0.0/15 ranges were not being marked as private subnets per RFC1918.
* Users without the proper permissions were able to add comments and Signals to Insights.
* Regular expressions ending with an asterisk `*` were not working properly in search/list filters.

### October 20, 2022 - Application Update

#### Support for Custom Inventory Sources

Cloud SIEM Enterprise now supports custom sources of inventory data. Now, if you want to ingest inventory data from a source that Sumo Logic does not provide a pre-built connnector for, you can use this new feature. See the new document [Configure a Custom Inventory Source](/docs/cse/administration/custom-inventory-sources/) for details.

#### Standard Match Lists

As a reminder, the migration for our out-of-the-box rules content from standard match lists to tags for Entities has begun. The system is now automatically setting the appropriate tags for any Entities appearing in any of the standard match lists called out in the [previous announcement](https://help.sumologic.com/release-notes-cse/2022/10/13/application-update/). This will continue until January 20, 2023, when the migration will be complete.

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] API endpoints have been creeated enabling users to upload attribute changes (such as tags or criticality) for multiple Entities in a single call, rather than having to do so one at a time. The new endpoints are `/entities/bulk-add-tags`, `/entities/bulk-update-tags`, `/entities/bulk-remove-tags`, `/entities/bulk-update-suppressed`, and `/entities/bulk-update-criticality`. Note that these API endpoints have a limit of 1000 entries per call. More details are available via the **API Documentation** link in Cloud SIEM Enterprise.
* [Updated] Previously, a new feature was added to the Enrichments tab that enabled you to hide any attribute-value pair with an "empty" value for clarity. This included values like "0" or "N/A". However, some of those values are often useful to the analyst (for example, `number_of_threat_reports="0"`). Starting with this release, this feature will only hide attributes with truly empty values (i.e., `attribute=""`).

#### Resolved Issues

* The CSV file upload method for updating Entity attributes did not support sensor zones or normalized entity names properly.
* CSE has switched providers of lists of public dynamic DNS domains, which has resolved an issue with rules utilizing these lists.

### October 13, 2022 - Application Update

#### Announcement: Standard Match Lists Migration to Entity Tags

Currently, CSE defines a set of standard Match Lists as a way to allow users to specify lists of Entities and other indicators that should affect whether or not Rules create Signals. However, starting next week, the Rules included with CSE will begin transitioning to leverage Entity tags for this purpose instead. Tags on Entities are more flexible and can also provide context to analysts during the investigation phase.

Next week, a new set of standard tag schemas will be introduced in CSE. These tag schemas will correspond to the existing standard Match Lists:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Allowed Values</th>
    <th>Equivalent Match List</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="8">_deviceGroup</td><td>admin</td><td>admin_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>awsAdmin</td><td>AWS_admin_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>business</td><td>business_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gcpAdmin</td><td>GCP_admin_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>googleWorkspaceAdmin</td><td>Google_Workspace_admin_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>salesforceAdmin</td><td>salesforce_admin_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>sandbox</td><td>sandbox_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>scanTarget</td><td>scanner_targets</td></tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="6">_deviceService</td><td>dns</td><td>dns_servers<br/>dns_servers_dst<br/>dns_servers_src</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ftp</td><td>ftp_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td>smtp</td><td>smtp_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td>sql</td><td>sql_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ssh</td><td>ssh_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td>telnet</td><td>telnet_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="8">_deviceType</td><td>authServer</td><td>auth_servers<br/>auth_servers_dst<br/>auth_servers_src</td></tr>
  <tr><td>lanScanner</td><td>lan_scanner_exception_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>nms</td><td>nms_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>paloAltoSinkhole</td><td>palo_alto_sinkhole_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>proxyServer</td><td>proxy_servers<br/>proxy_servers_dst<br/>proxy_servers_src</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vpnServer</td><td>vpn_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vulnerabilityScanner</td><td>vuln_scanners</td></tr>
  <tr><td>webServer</td><td>http_servers</td></tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="3">_networkType</td><td>guest</td><td>guest_networks</td></tr>
  <tr><td>nat</td><td>nat_ips</td></tr>
  <tr><td>vpn</td><td>vpn_networks</td></tr>
  <tr><td rowspan="6">_userGroup</td><td>awsAdmin</td><td>AWS_admin_users</td></tr>
  <tr><td>dsReplication</td><td>ds_replication_authorized_users</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gcpAdmin</td><td>GCP_admin_users</td></tr>
  <tr><td>googleWorkspaceAdmin</td><td>Google_Workspace_admin_users</td></tr>
  <tr><td>kerberosDowngrade</td><td>downgrade_krb5_etype_authorized_users</td></tr>
  <tr><td>salesforceAdmin</td><td>salesforce_admin_users</td></tr>
</table>

(There are five standard match lists *not* affected by this change, as they do not contain Entities. These include: business_asns, business_domains, business_hostnames, threat, and verified_uri_paths.)

**Beginning Thursday, October 20**, the contents of the standard match lists listed above will automatically be copied to tags set on the individual entities. So, for example, if an Entity `1.2.3.4` is in match list `sql_servers`, a tag `_deviceService:sql` will be set on it. CSE will continue to automatically create these tags from the standard match lists for a period of 3 months, **until January 20, 2023**. During this period, pre-defined rules will be updated to reference these tags instead of the standard match lists, so by the end of this period all rules will be updated and CSE will no longer automatically create these tags.

**Please update any process you use to maintain the members of standard match lists by January 20, 2023 to maintain standard Entity tags instead (or in addition).** We highly recommend you take advantage of Entity Groups to set Entity tags rather than individually setting tags. Entity Groups enable the automatic application of attributes like tags based on the Entity's value, IP address range, or inventory group.

Note that you cannot extend the standard tag schemas (for example, you cannot add a value `azureAdmin` to `_userGroup`). (The underscore prefix in the schema name means it's a system-defined schema.) Instead, create a different tag schema (such as `customUserGroup`) with such extended values.

You can refer to Entity tags in Rule expressions. For example, if you've attached the tag `_deviceService:sql` to an Entity, this statement will return "true" if that Entity is listed in a Record's `srcDevice_ip` field:
```
array_contains(fieldTags["srcDevice_ip"], "_deviceService:sql")
```
Additional information about the standard tag schema, match lists, Entity groups, and using these features with Rules is available in the [Cloud SIEM Documentation](/docs/cse).

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] Users can now filter object lists based on tag schema. The list results will include all objects that have a tag that are part of that schema. For example, if you search for `_networkType` (from the note above) the list results will include any object that has a tag of `_networkType:guest`, `_networkType:nat`, and/or `_networkType:vpn`.

#### Resolved Issues

* Entity relationships were not taking sensor zones into account properly.
* Entity details pages were only briefly displaying the proper Criticality.
* The Entities Count links on the Entity Criticality list pages were pointing at the wrong URLs.

### October 6, 2022 - Application Update

#### Application Update: Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] Dynamic severity in rules has been enhanced. Users can now specify ranges of values to match to a specific severity. There are now multiple options, and these options can be combined (the first rule that matches is used; if none match then the default is used):
  * **Equal to** Exact string or mathematical match ("Equal to 4" will match "4" and 4.0 but not 4.01)
  * **Greater than** and **Less than** Mathematical only, not inclusive ("Less than 5" will match 4.9 but not 5)
  * **Between** Mathematical only, inclusive ("Between 5 and 10" will match 5 or 7 but not 10.1)
  * **Not in the record** Will match when the _attribute_ is not listed in the record. (if there is no "bro_irc_value" attribute then this rule will match; if "bro_irc_value" exists but is empty/null, this does _not_ match)
* [New] Users can now filter the Signals list based on the type of Rule that generated the Signal (Match, Chain, Aggregation, etc.)
* [New] Users can now perform negative keyword searches ("not:aws" would return all objects that do _not_ include the keyword "aws")
* [New] Entity domain normalization can now be managed via Terraform
* [New] Users can now configure the Email Action to send emails in plain text in addition to the previously supported multipart HTML5/text format
* [New] Changes to the Insight Threshold are now noted in the Audit Log
* [Deleted] As previously announced, the IBM Resilient and Sensor actions have been removed from CSE

#### Resolved Issues

* Match list items were not matching properly in some instances, such as after deletion
* Keyword searches did not properly support values (such as hostnames) with embedded dashes
* Changes to prototype state were not visible in the rule history
* In some cases, the system was parsing domain names/TLDs incorrectly

### September 12, 2022 - Application Update

#### Insight Enrichment Server for Fed deployment

[Update] We’ve released a new version of the [Insight Enrichment Server](/docs/cse/integrations/insight-enrichment-server) that runs on the Sumo Logic FedRAMP-compliant deployment. This makes Cloud SIEM Enterprise (CSE) on FedRAMP functionally equivalent to commercial deployments of CSE.

---
### September 9, 2022 - Application Update

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] An API endpoint has been added which enables user to delete multiple entries in a match list in one operation: `POST: /match-list-items/bulk-delete`
* [Updated] When inventory data for hosts includes both private and public IP addresses, that data will be attached to both Entities. Previously it was only attached to one of the IP address Entities.
* [Updated] Previously we announced that the severity attribute for Insights in the Audit Logs would be switching from numbers (1-4) to text (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, etc). Instead, we have retained the existing numerical attribute and added a new attribute `severityName` containing the human-readable text.

#### Resolved Issues

* In some Audit Log messages related to Insight comments, the `insight_readable_id` was not set correctly.
* In some cases, manually adding or removing tags in an Insight was not being recorded in the Audit Logs properly.
* For some customers, the bar chart on the Records list page was not rendering properly.
* Time/date stamps were not being displayed consistently across the UI.
* Some pages were returning intermittent 404 or internal errors.

### September 1, 2022 - Application Update

#### Announcements

* Starting October 1, 2022, _suppressed _Signals will be retained in CSE for 30 days (previously, they were retained for 90 days). All Signals are automatically stored in the Sumo sec_signals index for 2 years, so users searching for suppressed Signals more than 30 days old should search in that index instead of in the CSE UI.
    * Note also that in the past, Signals attached to Insights were searchable from the CSE Signals list page indefinitely. Starting on October 1, they will only be searchable for 365 days. (They will still be visible from the Insight details page beyond that period.)
* As previously announced, the Sensor and IBM Resilient actions are no longer supported. They will be removed from CSE by the end of this month.

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] In the Audit Log, when an Insight is created, the sum of the included Signals' severity is now included with the insight in the `risk_score` field (i.e. if there were three Signals each with a severity of 4, the sum of 12 will be included).
* [Updated] The "Copy Expression" mouse action for record fields can now be activated using Shift+Click. The Click action now brings up a "Copy Value" action instead.
* [New] Users can now delete Match Lists from the list view (i.e. users no longer have to go into the details).
* [New] On the Criticality list page, the number of Entity Groups associated with each Criticality is now listed on the cards.

#### Resolved Issues

* In some cases where the Signals were relatively old, the Signals that contributed to an Insight were no longer visible in the Insight in the UI.
* Time stamps were missing from Records in some views.

#### Content Release

In 2 weeks (2022-09-15) we will be removing CHAIN-S00009 - 'Proofpoint TAP Click Permitted Followed by Successful Request' rule to consolidate Proofpoint TAP rules while providing equivalent detection value.

##### Rules

* [New] MATCH-S00818 Azure PRT Token Issued via Non Interactive Login
* [New] MATCH-S00821 Chromium Browser History Access by Non-Browser Process
* [New] MATCH-S00819 Chromium Process Started With Debugging Port

### August 25, 2022 - Application Update


#### Application Update

##### Cloud SIEM Enterprise App is now available

The CSE app gives you visibility into what’s going on in Cloud SIEM Enterprise. The app dashboards present high-level and detailed views into the Records that were created, the Signals that have fired, and the Insights generated by CSE. You can also get insight in CSE rules, including rule management activity, and which rules have fired.

This app is available to all licensed CSE customers in the Sumo Logic App Catalog. For more information, see [CSE App](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/cse).

### August 18, 2022 - Application Update

#### Resolved Issues

* Several issues were resolved related to the bulk upload of Entity attributes, including errors with CSV file parsing, editing uploaded attributes in the UI, and a lack of audit logging.
* On the Entity details page, the criticality was not being displayed properly.
Labels were not being created properly based on Network Blocks for a small number of customers.
* **InsightCommentCreated** audit events did not include the `readableId` attribute.
* For some record types, the `Actions` field was not being displayed if selected as a favorite field.

### July 28, 2022 - Application Update

#### Read-Only User Capabilities for CSE
New user capabilities (permissions) have been created enabling read-only access to content and configuration features in CSE.

These can be used when defining roles in the Sumo Logic platform (at **Administration > Users and Roles > Roles**).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Read-Only-Roles.png')} alt="read-only roles" />

(For those with CSE instances in the `jask.ai` domain, these capabilities are accessed via the **Configuration > Roles** page in CSE.)

Users with these capabilities (without the corresponding **Manage** capabilities) will be able to view the corresponding pages but will not be able to make changes on those pages. (Previously, users without the **Manage** capabilities could not see the corresponding pages.)

These permissions also apply to CSE APIs, so **View** (only) capabilities can now be assigned if desired.

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] When Threat Intelligence polling fails, the corresponding event will now include more information about the specific error that occurred.
* [Updated] The API endpoints that return information about Signals (`GET /signals`, `GET /signals/<id>`, and  `GET /signals/all`) now include the summary field (previously only accessible via the UI).
* [New] The Sumo Logic audit logs will now include events when a user adds or removes a Signal to/from an Insight, and when a user adds a comment to an Insight.

#### Resolved Issues
* The `GET /rules` and `GET /rules/<id>` API endpoints did not require role capabilities for access; they now require either View Rules or Manage Rules.
* Favorite Fields were not always being displayed on Signals generated by Threshold Rules.

---
### July 14, 2022 - Application Update

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements
* [Updated] The text size has been adjusted in some areas on the Rules details page to improve readability.

#### Resolved Issues
* In some instances, after uploading Network Blocks via .csv file, they would fail to appear in the UI.

##### Announcement Update
* The new Signal Index (recently announced) has been delayed, and will be available starting next week. As a result, the deprecation of the old Signal Forwarding feature will be delayed until September 22, 2022.

---
### July 21 - Application Update

#### Entity Groups

There are a number of ways that the use of Entity attributes - tags, criticality and suppression - provide value to users of Cloud SIEM Enterprise: Investigations can be completed faster with more context, Insights can be better prioritized with the appropriate severity, and false positive signals from test instances can be prevented, for example. However, setting those attributes has been a manual process and keeping them in sync as new Entities are defined is difficult.

That's why we are pleased to announce a new feature called Entity Groups. By defining Entity Groups, attributes can be automatically applied (or removed) based on Entity value (name), IP address, or Inventory group membership. For example, all high-risk laptops will receive higher criticality -- even if such a laptop is added to your environment months later.

Entities can even be members of more than one Entity Group, so a high-risk laptop in the Austin office could both get a tag identifying its location and receive the higher criticality. And if you later reassigned it so that it was no longer in a high-risk group, the criticality would be automatically removed.

To create an Entity Group, a new configuration menu item has been added:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-Menu.png')} alt="entity groups menu" />

On the Entity Groups page, click the Create button:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-List.png')} alt="entity groups list" />

This will open the detail dialog:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-Create.png')} alt="create entity group" />

Here you can decide what attribute Group membership should be based on:

* Group membership in your Inventory system (such as Active Directory)
* Entity value (name) - prefix or suffix (such as "aus-" or "-public")
* IP address range (for IP Address entities) defined using the CIDR format

Entity Groups also support [sensor zones](/docs/cse/administration/using-sensor-zones).

Then you can define what attribute(s) should be applied to member Entities - tags, criticality and/or suppression.

This release also includes API and Terraform support for Entity Groups.

More information about this exciting new feature and how to use it is in the documentation at Using Entity Groups.

#### Signal Index

Starting today, Signals generated by Cloud SIEM Enterprise will be automatically saved in a new sec_signal index. This special partition is similar to the existing sec_record_* indices in that, unlike data retained using the older Signal Forwarding feature, it will be saved in proper JSON supporting keyword search and nested attributes.

The new index is automatically generated and retained for a period of 2 years at no additional cost for all CSE customers.

As a result, the optional Signal Forwarding feature will be deprecated on September 22, 2022. Existing data will not be deleted but new Signals generated after that date will no longer be forwarded and the option will no longer be available in CSE.

Customers leveraging Signal Forwarding data to generate dashboards (or for other use cases) will need to modify those applications to use the new sec_signal index before September 22.

Note that because the new index is a special partition, a single query cannot be used to search both the sec_signal index and older forwarded Signal data simultaneously.

More information about using the special security indices is in the documentation at [Searching for CSE Data in Sumo Logic](/docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/search-cse-records-in-sumo).

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] The page used to configure the detection window and Insight threshold has moved. Where previously it was accessed from a button on the Custom Insights list page, it is now accessed via a new Workflow > Detection
option in the Configuration menu:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Threshold-Menu.png')} alt="threshold menu" />

Note the URL has also changed as a result; please update any bookmarks.

#### Resolved Issues

When navigating to a CSE page (with `sumologic.com` in the domain name), if the user had to login/authenticate first, they were not auto-forwarded to the appropriate CSE page after doing so (but instead was taken to the Continuous Intelligence Platform home page). This has now been resolved and users will be auto-forwarded correctly.

### June 24, 2022 - Announcement

### June 13, 2022 Application Update  

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] List filters have been updated to better support custom Entity types; users no longer have to specify the Entity type in order to filter by Entity value (i.e. name). (Old bookmark will continue to work.)
* [Updated] On the Insight Details pages, the sort order for Signals has been reverted to oldest first. As always, the user can change the sort order and in an upcoming release, the UI will be updated to retain the user's selected sort order across sessions.
* [Deleted] The standalone **Suppressed Entities** list page has been removed from the UI as it was confusing to users. To retrieve a list of suppressed Entities, users should filter the Entities list page.

#### Resolved Issues

* CSV upload for Network Blocks was not working unless the (optional) "label" field was provided.
* Then filtering lists by date, the "include current" checkbox was not working consistently.

### June 1, 2022 - Announcement

#### Geographical Data for IP Addresses

* As previously announced, CSE has switched to a new provider for geographical data for IP addresses. One consequence of this change is that the various `_isp` enrichment fields (listed below) are no longer being populated. However, that data is available in the equivalent `_asnOrg` fields (such as `device_ip_asnOrg`). If you have any rules that leverage the `_isp` fields, please switch to the `_asnOrg` fields as soon as possible.
* Because these fields will no longer be populated, they will be removed on **June 7, 2022**:
    * `device_ip_isp`
    * `device_natIp_isp`
    * `device_replyIp_isp`
    * `dstDevice_ip_isp`
    * `dstDevice_natIp_isp`
    * `srcDevice_ip_isp`
    * `srcDevice_natIp_isp`

### May 27, 2022 - Application Update

#### Upcoming Changes

* [Updated] Starting later next week, the `severity` attribute in audit log records for Insights (such as `InsightCreated`) will be changing. Instead of a number (represented as a string) from 1 to 4, the value will be a human-readable string matching the values in the UI (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL). Please update any dashboards or other consumers of this data.
* [Deleted] Later next week, the **Content **> **Suppressed Entities **page will be removed from the UI to simplify the application. Instead, users can use a filter on the **Content **> **Entities **page to retrieve the list of suppressed Entities.

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] On the Insight Details pages, Signals are now sorted in order of the most recent Signal first by default. (As always, the user can change the sort order.)
* [New] When creating a copy of a Rule, users are now given then option to apply the Rule Tuning Expression(s) that are applied on the original rule to the copy as well.
* [New] In the CSE UI, timestamps now explicitly include the time zone.
* [New] Users can now specify a maximum look-back window (in days) for TAXII feeds.
* [New] The current status (enabled/disabled) for each feed is now displayed on the Threat Intelligence list page.

#### Resolved Issues

* If a user had defined a high number of favorite fields, the system would show the first 50.
* When specifying tags, the auto-complete feature was not working properly in some instances.

### May 17, 2022 - Application Update

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] The `_sourceName` and `_sourceHost` values in records ingested by CSE will now reflect the original values defined when ingested into the Sumo Logic platform.
* [Updated] The "Board" list view for Insights has been updated to include the resolution:
<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/Resolved-Board-view.png')} alt="board-view" />

#### Resolved Issues

* In the new Entities tab in Insights, duplicate Entities were sometimes listed if the raw and normalized names didn't match. Also, the cards will now respond better to very low screen/browser widths.
* When viewing some verbose content (like Record properties), mousing over the content would cause it to reflow.
* When creating match list items via Terraform, the process was occasionally timing out.
* Email-based actions were not functioning properly on instances with domains ending in `jask.ai`.

### April 29, 2022 - Application Update

#### Related Entities

[New] The Cloud SIEM Enterprise team is excited to announce a newly enhanced feature: Related Entities. Although Insights and the Signals they contain are focused on a single Entity (a user, or host for example), there are often a number of additional Entities referenced in the Records/Signals contained in the Insight. In addition, CSE can detect relationships between Entities (for example, determining that an IP address was associated with a given hostname during the Insight detection window).

To provide an easy way for analysts to explore all of these Related Entities, a new tab has been added to the Insight Details page:

The **Entities **tab contains a list of all of the Entities detected in the Insight’s Signals and Records. The Primary Entity is listed first, and then the other Related Entities are listed in descending order of appearance. Where CSE has determined a relationship between entities, that is called out (for example, 192.168.1.101 may also be hostname ‘na’).

Details listed with each entity include tags, the number of Signals the Entity was seen in, the number of recent Insights and Signals that featured that Entity, and the total sum of the Severities for those Signals.

As each Entity is selected by the user, the right column changes to show more details, such as a link to the full Entity Details page, inventory and other metadata, a Signal timeline, and a list of the recent Signals and Insights (containing links to those individual details pages).

This new feature should help users understand the context of security events more quickly by providing this data at a glance, reducing the amount of time it would have previously taken to gather that same information.

More information can be found in the [online documentation](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/about-cse-insight-ui#entities-tab).


#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

[Update] For Signals generated by Threshold, Aggregation and Chain Rules, there is a feature called [Queried Records](/docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/view-records-signal#View-additional-Records-for-a-Signal) that enables users to find additional records that also apply to the Signal beyond those that were needed to meet the conditions for the Rule.The page that lists these Queried Records now explicitly shows the search query and time window that is being checked. If a user clicks on the query, it will open a Log Search window with the query and time window pre-filled for deeper investigation.

---
### April 18, 2022 - Application Update

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [New] API endpoints are now available to add or remove a given Signal to/from a given Insight, `PUT "/insights/<insightId>/signals"` and `DELETE "/insights/<insightId>/signals"` respectively. (For both endpoints, the request body is a list containing signal ID(s) to add or remove from the insight as the request body, the response is the updated Insight.)
* [Update] The way CSE displays group membership in Active Directory inventory objects is changing. Previously, it was displayed in LDAP form (i.e., `cn=groupname,dc=something,dc=domain,dc=com`); now it will just show the group name.

#### Resolved Issues

* Signal and Insight timestamps in the Cloud SIEM Enterprise UI were not always displayed in the user’s preferred time zone.

---
### April 15, 2022 - Announcements

* Because it can now be connected via more standardized TAXII feeds, the integration between Cloud SIEM Enterprise and **Anomali ThreatStream** has been **deprecated** as of **April 15, 2022**. If you are using this integration, be sure to convert to a TAXII feed. To set up a feed, first follow Anomali’s documentation for [Setting up a TAXII feed for ThreatStream](https://www.anomali.com/blog/generating-your-own-threat-intelligence-feeds-in-threatstream) then Sumo Logic’s documentation for [Integrating CSE with a TAXII Feed](/docs/cse/integrations/integrate-cse-with-taxii-feed).
* The Entity API has been updated to include a new field `IsSuppressed`. This field replaces `IsWhitelisted` which has been **deprecated** as of **April 15, 2022**. If you were previously using `IsWhitelisted` please ensure you have switched to the new field.

### April 7, 2022 - Announcement

On April 21, 2022 we will be removing the following legacy log mappers related to the CIP Windows collector from the CSE platform. These log mappers are in use with only a small portion of our customer base and we are working with our technical account teams to reach out directly to those impacted and migrate to our newer Sumo parsers.

No loss of out-of-the-box functionality will occur and no out-of-the-box rules are impacted as the Sumo parsers map all of the same information. Please be sure to check any custom rules that leverage Windows logging for compatibility with the new parsing and mapping, particularly where the "fields" field is referenced.

#### Upcoming Removal of Unused Content

On Tuesday, April 12th, **unused **legacy grok parsers and their corresponding log mappers will be removed from CSE.
