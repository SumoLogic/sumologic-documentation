#### Cloud SIEM network sensor end-of-life

As [previously announced](/release-notes-cse/2024/12/31/#november-8-2024---application-update), the Sumo Logic Product Team is discontinuing our on-premise network sensor feature for Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM. Support for the feature ends as of November 8, 2025. We fully support a customer or partner managed [Zeek network sensor](/docs/cse/ingestion/ingestion-sources-for-cloud-siem/corelight-zeek/) as a data source for our Cloud SIEM product that will provide equivalent monitoring of your network.
