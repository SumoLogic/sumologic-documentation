### Cloud SIEM network sensor end-of-life

The Sumo Logic Product Team is discontinuing our on-premise network sensor feature for Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM. The feature will no longer receive updates as of November 8, 2024, and support ends as of April 30, 2025. We fully support a customer or partner managed [Zeek network sensor](/docs/cse/sensors/ingest-zeek-logs/) as a data source for our Cloud SIEM product that will provide equivalent monitoring of your network.
