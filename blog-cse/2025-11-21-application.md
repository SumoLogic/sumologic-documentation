### AI tools for insight investigation (Beta)

We're excited to announce two new AI tools to assist in your Security Operation Center (SOC) team's investigation of Cloud SIEM insights:
* SOC Analyst Agent
* Investigation Agent

These powerful AI tools are designed to improve the speed and accuracy of your SOC team's threat investigations.

#### SOC Analyst Agent

A new **AI Investigation** tab in Cloud SIEM provides an AI-generated analysis of insights that accelerates investigation and troubleshooting by your SOC team. The information in the tab is generated by Sumo Logic's SOC Analyst Agent, an agentic AI tool.

####  Investigation Agent

When you select the **Ask Mobot** button on the new **AI Investigation** tab in Cloud SIEM, the insight's AI-generated information is launched in Sumo Logic Mobot. There you can use Sumo Logic's Investigation Agent to drill down into the insight for greater detail.
