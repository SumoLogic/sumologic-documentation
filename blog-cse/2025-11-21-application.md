### SOC Analyst Agent (Beta)

We're excited to announce Sumo Logic's SOC Analyst Agent, a powerful agentic AI tool designed to improve the speed and accuracy of your Security Operations Center (SOC) team's threat investigations.

The SOC Analyst Agent provides the following new functionality:
* AI Investigation tab in Cloud SIEM
* Insight investigation in Mobot

#### AI Investigation tab

A new **AI Investigation** tab in Cloud SIEM provides an AI-generated analysis of insights that accelerates investigation and troubleshooting by your SOC team.

####  Insight investigation in Mobot

When you select the **Ask Mobot** button on the new **AI Investigation** tab in Cloud SIEM, the insight's AI-generated information is launched in Sumo Logic Mobot. There you can use Mobot's focused query capabilities to drill down into the insight for greater detail.
