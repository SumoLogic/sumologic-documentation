## Rules
- [New] MATCH-S00897 Chromium Extension Installed
    - Threat actors may install browser extensions as a form of persistence on victim systems. Look up the 32 character extension ID in order to ensure that the extension is valid and expected to be installed as part of normal business operations. This extension ID can be found in the following values: {{file_path}} and/or {{changeTarget}} depending on the source of the telemetry. This rule logic utilizes Sysmon file creation events, which need to be enabled and configured on relevant assets.
- [New] FIRST-S00064 First Seen Certificate Thumbprint in Successful Kerberos Authentication
    - This alert looks for a first seen certtificate thumbprint being used to authenticate to an Active Directory environment, resulting in a Kerberos ticket being successfully issued. This alert is designed to catch Active Directory Certificate Services related attacks, ensure the certificate thumprint is valid, correlate the thumbprint ID with other Certificate Services events, particularly looking for recently issued templates.
- [New] MATCH-S00949 GitHub - Vulnerability Alerts
    - Detects vulnerability alerts created for a GitHub repository.
- [New] FIRST-S00070 Okta - First Seen Application Accessed by User
    - This signal looks for a user that is accessing an application behind Okta SSO that is first seen since the baseline period. Ensure that access of this application is expected and authorized, look for other Okta events around the user account in question to determine whether access to this application is expected and authorized.
- [New] AGGREGATION-S00007 Okta - Session Anomaly (Multiple Operating Systems)
    - This rule detects when a user has utilized multiple distinct operating systems when performing authentication through Okta. This activity could potentially indicate credential theft or a general session anomaly. Examine other Okta related events surrounding the time period for this signal, pivoting off the username value to examine if any other suspicious activity has taken place. If this rule is generating false positives, adjust the threshold value and consider excluding certain user accounts via tuning expression or a match list.
- [New] MATCH-S01020 Threat Intel - Matched Target Email
    - Detects email addresses associated with known malicious actor(s) or campaign(s) as designated by a threat intelligence provider.
- [New] MATCH-S01019 Threat Intel - Matched User Email
    - Detects email addresses associated with known malicious actor(s) or campaign(s) as designated by a threat intelligence provider.
- [Updated] MATCH-S00170 Windows - Scheduled Task Creation
    - Fixed spelling error.
