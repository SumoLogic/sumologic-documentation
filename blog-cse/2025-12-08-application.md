### New look for list pages

We're excited to announce a new look for list pages in Cloud SIEM. We've replaced "cards" with table rows for a simpler, cleaner appearance that more closely matches how we present data in the rest of Sumo Logic. This new presentation lets you see more at a glance, allowing you to more quickly evaluate your SIEM data.

To learn more, see our list view documentation for:
* [Insights](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/about-cse-insight-ui/#list-view)
* [Entities](docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/view-manage-entities/#about-the-entities-list-page)
* [Signals](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/intro-for-analysts/#dive-into-signals-and-entities)
