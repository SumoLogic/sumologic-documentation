## Deprecation Notice

After careful evaluation, we have determined that Grok patterns are deprecated immediately for customers not using the feature in the last 30 days. A more robust and configurable solution is already available for customers in the Sumo Logic parsers. More details on how parsing works in Sumo Logic can be found in the [Parsing Language Reference Guide](/docs/cse/schema/parsing-language-reference-guide).

For customers who are still using Grok, further communication along with a path to migration to the Sumo Logic parsers will be provided in the coming weeks.
