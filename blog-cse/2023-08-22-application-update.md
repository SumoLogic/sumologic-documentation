## Deprecation Notice

After careful evaluation, we have deprecated Grok patterns immediately for customers who've not used the feature in the last 30 days. Our more robust and configurable solution is already available for customers in the Sumo Logic parsers. More details on how parsing works in Sumo Logic can be found in the [Parsing Language Reference Guide](/docs/cse/schema/parsing-language-reference-guide).

For customers who are still using Grok, further communication along with a path to migration to the Sumo Logic parsers will be provided in the coming weeks.
