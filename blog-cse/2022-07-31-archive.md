## July 28, 2022 - Application Update

### Read-Only User Capabilities for CSE
New user capabilities (permissions) have been created enabling read-only access to content and configuration features in CSE.

These can be used when defining roles in the Sumo Logic platform (at **Administration > Users and Roles > Roles**).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Read-Only-Roles.png')} alt="read-only roles" />

(For those with CSE instances in the `jask.ai` domain, these capabilities are accessed via the **Configuration > Roles** page in CSE.)

Users with these capabilities (without the corresponding **Manage** capabilities) will be able to view the corresponding pages but will not be able to make changes on those pages. (Previously, users without the **Manage** capabilities could not see the corresponding pages.)

These permissions also apply to CSE APIs, so **View** (only) capabilities can now be assigned if desired.

### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] When Threat Intelligence polling fails, the corresponding event will now include more information about the specific error that occurred.
* [Updated] The API endpoints that return information about Signals (`GET /signals`, `GET /signals/<id>`, and  `GET /signals/all`) now include the summary field (previously only accessible via the UI).
* [New] The Sumo Logic audit logs will now include events when a user adds or removes a Signal to/from an Insight, and when a user adds a comment to an Insight.

### Resolved Issues
* The `GET /rules` and `GET /rules/<id>` API endpoints did not require role capabilities for access; they now require either View Rules or Manage Rules.
* Favorite Fields were not always being displayed on Signals generated by Threshold Rules.

## July 14, 2022 - Application Update

### Minor Changes and Enhancements
* [Updated] The text size has been adjusted in some areas on the Rules details page to improve readability.

### Resolved Issues
* In some instances, after uploading Network Blocks via .csv file, they would fail to appear in the UI.

#### Announcement Update
* The new Signal Index (recently announced) has been delayed, and will be available starting next week. As a result, the deprecation of the old Signal Forwarding feature will be delayed until September 22, 2022.

## July 21 - Application Update

### Entity Groups

There are a number of ways that the use of Entity attributes - tags, criticality and suppression - provide value to users of Cloud SIEM Enterprise: Investigations can be completed faster with more context, Insights can be better prioritized with the appropriate severity, and false positive signals from test instances can be prevented, for example. However, setting those attributes has been a manual process and keeping them in sync as new Entities are defined is difficult.

That's why we are pleased to announce a new feature called Entity Groups. By defining Entity Groups, attributes can be automatically applied (or removed) based on Entity value (name), IP address, or Inventory group membership. For example, all high-risk laptops will receive higher criticality -- even if such a laptop is added to your environment months later.

Entities can even be members of more than one Entity Group, so a high-risk laptop in the Austin office could both get a tag identifying its location and receive the higher criticality. And if you later reassigned it so that it was no longer in a high-risk group, the criticality would be automatically removed.

To create an Entity Group, a new configuration menu item has been added:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-Menu.png')} alt="entity groups menu" />

On the Entity Groups page, click the Create button:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-List.png')} alt="entity groups list" />

This will open the detail dialog:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Entity-Groups-Create.png')} alt="create entity group" />

Here you can decide what attribute Group membership should be based on:

* Group membership in your Inventory system (such as Active Directory)
* Entity value (name) - prefix or suffix (such as "aus-" or "-public")
* IP address range (for IP Address entities) defined using the CIDR format

Entity Groups also support [sensor zones](/docs/cse/administration/using-sensor-zones).

Then you can define what attribute(s) should be applied to member Entities - tags, criticality and/or suppression.

This release also includes API and Terraform support for Entity Groups.

More information about this exciting new feature and how to use it is in the documentation at Using Entity Groups.

### Signal Index

Starting today, Signals generated by Cloud SIEM Enterprise will be automatically saved in a new sec_signal index. This special partition is similar to the existing sec_record_* indices in that, unlike data retained using the older Signal Forwarding feature, it will be saved in proper JSON supporting keyword search and nested attributes.

The new index is automatically generated and retained for a period of 2 years at no additional cost for all CSE customers.

As a result, the optional Signal Forwarding feature will be deprecated on September 22, 2022. Existing data will not be deleted but new Signals generated after that date will no longer be forwarded and the option will no longer be available in CSE.

Customers leveraging Signal Forwarding data to generate dashboards (or for other use cases) will need to modify those applications to use the new sec_signal index before September 22.

Note that because the new index is a special partition, a single query cannot be used to search both the sec_signal index and older forwarded Signal data simultaneously.

More information about using the special security indices is in the documentation at [Searching for CSE Data in Sumo Logic](/docs/cse/records-signals-entities-insights/search-cse-records-in-sumo).

### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* [Updated] The page used to configure the detection window and Insight threshold has moved. Where previously it was accessed from a button on the Custom Insights list page, it is now accessed via a new Workflow > Detection
option in the Configuration menu:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/Threshold-Menu.png')} alt="threshold menu" />

Note the URL has also changed as a result; please update any bookmarks.

### Resolved Issues

When navigating to a CSE page (with `sumologic.com` in the domain name), if the user had to login/authenticate first, they were not auto-forwarded to the appropriate CSE page after doing so (but instead was taken to the Continuous Intelligence Platform home page). This has now been resolved and users will be auto-forwarded correctly.
