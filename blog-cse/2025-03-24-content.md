This content release includes Threat Intelligence match rules that use the new [`hasThreatMatch`](/docs/cse/rules/cse-rules-syntax/#hasthreatmatch) operator to support both global and custom threat intelligence feeds.

To reduce initial signal volume, basic inbound and outbound IP address threat match rules with a low or medium confidence level are disabled by default (see below). We highly recommend tuning these rules before enabling them to reduce signal volume, and therefore entity risk assignment, to manageable levels.
