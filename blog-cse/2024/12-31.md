:::

#### Rules
- [New] MATCH-S00952 GitHub - Administrator Added or Invited
    - Detects additions or invitations of GitHub Administrators. Illegitimate addition of administrative users could be an indication of privilege escalation or persistence by adversaries.
- [New] MATCH-S00953 GitHub - Audit Logging Modification
    - Detects modifications to the GitHub Enterprise Audit Log. Modifications and deletions have the potential to reduce visibility of malicious activity.
- [New] MATCH-S00954 GitHub - Copilot Seat Cancelled by GitHub
    - Observes for GitHub staff manually revoking copilot access for a user. This action is likely to be rare and may be indicative of a user violating the [acceptable use policy for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies).
- [New] FIRST-S00091 GitHub - First Seen Activity From Country for User
    - Detects GitHub user activity from a new country. User account compromises can be detected through unusual geolocation in some cases. To lower possible false positives, a tuning expression for expected country names or codes can be added,.
- [New] FIRST-S00090 GitHub - First Seen Application Interacting with API
    - Detects new application usage of the GitHub API. New applications utilizing the API may be routine, however this may also reveal malicious applications utilizing the API.
- [New] MATCH-S00950 GitHub - Member Invitation or Addition
    - Detects new user additions or invitations to the business or organization GitHub. New user additions/invitations should be monitored as they could be a vector for malicious actors to establish access or persistence.
- [New] MATCH-S00955 GitHub - Member Permissions Modification
    - Detects modifications of GitHub user permissions. Added permissions for a user should be monitored for potential privilege escalation by an adversary.
- [New] MATCH-S00956 GitHub - OAuth Application Activity
    - Detects OAuth application activities within GitHub. OAuth application management and access activity should be monitored for potential abuse by potential malicious actors, either by creating malicious access paths within GitHub, or destruction of GitHub infrastructure.
- [New] MATCH-S00957 GitHub - Organization Transfer
    - Detects transfers of an organization to another enterprise This is a sensitive activity that should be monitored to ensure organizations and their repositories are not being transferred without proper authorization.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00026 GitHub - Outlier in Distinct User Agent Strings by User
    - Detects an outlier in the number of distinct user agent strings for a GitHub user. Unusual user agent strings for a user account could indicate account takeover.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00028 GitHub - Outlier in Removal Actions by User
    - Detects a higher than usual number of removal actions undertaken by a user. This detection has a broad scope to detect any unusual number of destroy, delete, or remove actions undertaken by a user to help detect a range of different potential destructive activities in GitHub.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00027 GitHub - Outlier in Repository Cloning or Downloads
    - Detects an unusual number of repository clones for a user. Unusual repository cloning could indicate data exfiltration or discovery.
- [New] MATCH-S00958 GitHub - PR Review Requirement Removed
    - Detects GitHub pull request review requirements being removed from a repository either via branch protection rule or ruleset.
- [New] MATCH-S00959 GitHub - Repository Public Key Deletion
    - Detects deletions of SSH keys in GitHub. Unusual deletions could represent an adversary attempting to disrupt normal operations by denying access.
- [New] MATCH-S00960 GitHub - Repository Transfer
    - Detects transfers of a repository to another organization or user. This is a sensitive activity that GitHub places in the "Danger Zone" of repository setting and should be monitored to ensure no unauthorized transfers are taking place.
- [New] MATCH-S00961 GitHub - Repository Visibility Changed to Public
    - Detects a user making a repository public. This action should be closely monitored and mitigative actions taken even if the published repository is deleted, or reverted to private. Reference: https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github
- [New] MATCH-S00962 GitHub - Repository Visibility Permissions Changed
    - Detects repository visibility permissions being changed to allow members of an organization to change the visibility of repositories. This activity introduces the potential for data leakage if a private or internal repository is changed to public and should be monitored to ensure no inadvertent or malicious publication of a repository.
- [New] MATCH-S00963 GitHub - SSH Key Created for Private Repo
    - Detects the creation of an SSH key for a private GitHub repository.  Performed maliciously, creating an SSH key could create a parallel access path for an attacker.
- [New] MATCH-S00964 GitHub - SSO Recovery Codes Access Activity
    - Detects activities accessing SSO recovery codes. SSO recovery codes can enable a user to bypass normal more stringent authentication routes.
- [New] MATCH-S00951 GitHub - Secret Scanning Alert
    - Observes for secret scanning alerts from GitHub. Secrets detected by GitHub Enterprise Cloud undergo validation by GitHub automatically, to determine whether they are actively in use, this is not surfaced in the audit log, and will require separate inspection. For more information see [Evaluating alerts from secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning/evaluating-alerts).
- [New] MATCH-S00965 GitHub - Secret Scanning Potentially Disabled
    - Detects actions which disable or modify secret scanning policies for an organization or repository. Modifying or disabling secret scanning may lead to inadvertent leaking of credentials.
- [New] MATCH-S00966 GitHub - Two-Factor Authentication Disabled for Organization
    - Observes for two-factor authentication being disabled for a GitHub organization. Removing two-factor authentication requirements significantly degrades the security of the GitHub organization by permitting password only authentication.
- [Updated] THRESHOLD-S00095 Password Attack from Host
    - Modified the rule expression to remove the `srcDevice_ip` entity selector and the `isNull` from the rule expression for entities from the existing rule, and creates a new rule for those entities so that there are 2 versions of the rule's intent.

### November 7, 2024 - Content Release

This content release includes:
- New detection rules.
- Updates to existing detection rules to correct rule logic and reduce false positives.
- New parsing and mapping support for Automox, WatchGuard Firewall, and Digital Guardian ARC.
- Update to existing AWS Application Load Balancer parsing and mapping to support Connection logs.
- Update to MITRE ATT&CK tag schema to support ATT&CK v16.0.

Changes are enumerated below.

#### Rules
- [New] CHAIN-S00018 Autorun file created after USB disk mount on host
    - This signal looks for a USB drive being mounted on a Windows host followed by a file creation event with the file name of "autorun.inf" within a 5-minute time frame. This activity could be indicative of an attempt at lateral movement or initial access avenues through a USB device. Ensure that the machine in question is authorized to use USB devices and look for other file creation events from this host around the same time frame.
- [New] FIRST-S00071 First Seen AWS ConsoleLogin by User
    - First observance of a user logging on to the Amazon AWS console. This could be indicative of new administrator onboarding, or an unauthorized access to the AWS console. Recommended to investigate the nature of the user account and the login.
- [New] FIRST-S00080 First Seen Azure Portal access by User
    - First observance of a user logging on to the Microsoft Azure Portal. This could be indicative of new user onboarding, or an unauthorized access to the Azure portal. Recommended to investigate the nature of the user account and the login.
- [New] FIRST-S00073 First Seen Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy
    - The first observed execution of the PowerShell CMDLet Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy on this host. This CMDLet can be used in the discovery of Windows Domain Password Policies by threat actors. Investigating the host and active users for additional activity around the time of execution is recommended.
- [New] FIRST-S00072 First Seen Group Policy Discovery Operation
    - This detection is a first observed execution of Windows process or PowerShell commands that can be run by users or administrators in order to gather password policy and other types of system information in an enterprise environment. The detections in this signal are based off variations found in Atomic Red Team test cases. Reference:  https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1615/T1615.md. Look at the command line and parent process details of the signal in order to determine if this execution is legitimate or part of system provisioning or systems administration operations.
- [New] FIRST-S00076 First Seen Net Command Use on Host
    - Microsoft’s Net.exe can be used for multiple Discovery tactics, including Password Policy, Permissions, Account and Domain Trust Discovery. This detection identifies the first observance of a Net related command on a system related to these discovery tactics. It is recommended to investigate the host and user to determine if this is authorized admin activity or needs further inspection.
- [New] FIRST-S00065 First Seen Successful Authentication From Unexpected Country
    - First Seen rule which triggers when there are at least two successful logins from the same user with different country codes indicating possible credential theft. It is recommended to add filtering criteria to the expression to reduce false positives, such as known VPN addresses.(If degradation issues occur it is recommendation implementing tuning around your expected network.)
- [New] FIRST-S00074 First Seen driverquery execution on host
    - First observed execution of the driverquery command on the following device host: `{{device_hostname}}`. Driverquery is a useful command for an attacker to enumerate local device drivers to determine next steps in the attack. Vulnerability scanners and automated processes may trigger this detection. It is recommended to identify and filter these processes out using a Tuning Expression for the corresponding baseImage. On detection, investigate the host and process executing the command to assist in understanding the context of the execution.
- [New] FIRST-S00079 First Seen gpresult execution on host
    - This detection is first observed execution of gpresult on a host. This command may be used by attackers to access detailed password policy information in an enterprise environment. Vulnerability scanners and automated processes may trigger this detection. It is recommended to identify and filter these processes out using a Tuning Expression for the corresponding baseImage. On detection, investigate the host and process executing the command to assist in understanding the context of the execution.
- [New] FIRST-S00067 Okta - First Seen Client ID/ASN combo in successful OIDC token grant
    - This signal looks for a new Client ID value ( mapped to the `user_username` field ) and ASN combination being issued an OIDC token, excluding the Okta Browser Plugin and Okta Dashboard. Use the Okta admin portal and look at the "Applications" section to cross-reference the Client ID value. Ensure that the IP address that is requesting the token is known and that this operation is expected and authorized.
- [New] FIRST-S00068 Okta - First Seen User Accessing Admin Application
    - A user not seen since the baseline period has accessed the Okta admin application. Ensure that this user is expected to perform Okta administrative activities. If this user is expected and authroized, consider adding the user to the "Okta_Admins" match list to exclude the user from this signal.
- [New] FIRST-S00066 Okta - First Seen User Requesting Report
    - This signal looks for a first seen user requesting an export of an Okta report. The various Okta report types can be found in the “Reports” section of the Okta administrative portal and can include various report types such as application password help, MFA usage, and reports around user access. During the October 2023 Okta incident, threat actors downloaded reports from Okta portals to extract information regarding user contact information. Ensure that the user that is requesting such reports is authorized and that this activity is expected. If a suspicious report generation event occurs, look at the “target” element within the event to gain more detailed information as to the type of report being generated and exported.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00018 Okta - Outlier in ASNs Used to Access Applications
    - This signal looks for an outlier in the number of distinct autonomous system numbers (ASNs) that a particular user utilizes to access Okta resources within an hour time period. This is designed to alert on various forms of token or credential theft as well as general Okta session anomalies.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00017 Okta - Outlier in MFA Attempts Denied by User
    - This signal builds an hourly baseline of MFA denied events per user and triggers when an outlier in the number of denied attempts is detected. This signal is designed to trigger on MFA-fatigue type attacks. If false positives are detected, consider excluding certain users from the alerting logic or raise the minimum count value within the rule configuration.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00016 Okta - Outlier in OIDC token request failures
    - This signal looks for an outlier in the number of OpenID Connect (OIDC) token request failures for an Okta client application. Use the Okta admin portal to correlate the Client ID (mapped to `user_username`) to determine what application is being targeted. Pivot off the Client ID and IP address values to examine the raw Okta events in order to ensure that this activity is planned and expected. This activity can occur during setup and development of Okta applications and integrations.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00013 Outlier in Data Outbound Per Day by Admin or Sensitive Device
    - A larger than typical amount of data has been observed being sent outbound from a Sensitive Device or an Admin user. It is recommended to investigate the device associated with this IP, the Internet destinations, and traffic associated with this anomalous behavior. A normalized record search for the source IP and external network traffic within the period of time of the detection will help identify suspicious activity. This rule is dependent on the Match Lists "domain_controllers" and "admin_usernames" being populated with the sensitive device IPs and admin usernames. Additionally, Entity Tagging offers a similar and extensible alternative to Match Lists. To add more sensitive Match Lists or Entity Tagging, use Rule Tuning Expressions. For further customization, consider adjusting the severity of this rule and/or using entity severity as needed to increase the severity of this rule.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00015 Outlier in Data Outbound Per Hour by Admin or Sensitive Device
    - A larger than typical amount of data has been observed being sent outbound from a Sensitive Device or an Admin user. It is recommended to investigate the device associated with this IP, the Internet destinations, and traffic associated with this anomalous behavior. A normalized record search for the source IP and external network traffic within the period of time of the detection will help identify suspicious activity. This rule is dependent on the Match Lists "domain_controllers" and "admin_usernames" being populated with the sensitive device IPs and admin usernames. Additionally, Entity Tagging offers a similar and extensible alternative to Match Lists. To add more sensitive Match Lists or Entity Tagging, use Rule Tuning Expressions. For further customization, consider adjusting the severity of this rule and/or using entity severity as needed to increase the severity of this rule.
- [Updated] THRESHOLD-S00095 Password Attack
    - Added NULL exclusion to rule expression to prevent false-positives stemming from NULL IP or hostnames.
- [Updated] MATCH-S00556 Outbound Data Transfer Protocol Over Non-standard Port
    - Added missing parenthesis to match expression.

#### Rules

- [New] MATCH-S00922 AWS Bedrock Agent Created.
    - This rule detects when an AWS Bedrock Agent has been created in the environment.
    Bedrock Agents can be configured with various parameters to build AI applications.
- [New] MATCH-S00924 AWS Bedrock Guardrail Deleted.
    - AWS Bedrock Guardrails provide users with the ability to configure options like filtering out harmful content or defining denied topics for models. Guardrails also allow the blocking of sensitive information such as PII. Ensure that this deletion was performed by an authorized user during an expected change.
- [New] MATCH-S00923 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Denied for User.
    - A user has attempted to invoke a model via AWS Bedrock for which access was denied due to a permission issue. This event can be a normal occurrence for a user who has not been provisioned the proper IAM resources for AWS Bedrock.
- [New] MATCH-S00921 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Logging Configuration Change Observed.
    - An AWS Bedrock Model invocation logging configuration change was observed. Ensure that this activity is expected and authorized.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00024 AWS DynamoDB Outlier in GetItem Events from User.
    - An outlier in GetItem events to a DynamoDB resource within an hour time period has been detected. Ensure that the user performing these actions has business justification for modifying DynamoDB tables and instances.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00025 AWS S3 Outlier in PutObject Denied Events
    - This rule utilizes an hourly baseline to detect an outlier in the number of denied PutObject access events to an S3 bucket. AWS Data events are necessary for this signal to function.
- [New] MATCH-S00390 Attempted Credential Dump From Registry Via Reg.Exe
    - Monitors for use of reg.exe with parameters indicating the attempted export of hashed credentials.
Audit Object Access (success and failure) must be enabled for this rule to function.
- [New] MATCH-S00896 Azure Authentication Policy Change
    - Various authentication related policy configurations exist within Azure. These are tenant-wide policy changes that affect aspects such as enabling of number matching, changing of which authentication methods users are allowed to use, or the exclusion of certain groups from various authentication methods.
- [New] MATCH-S00525 Credential Dumping Via Copy Command From Shadow Copy
    - This rule detects credential dumping using copy command from a shadow copy.
- [New] FIRST-S00084 First Seen AWS Bedrock API Call from User
    - This rule looks for a first seen AWS Bedrock API call from a user since the baseline period. Ensure the user in question is authorized to utilize AWS Bedrock services.
- [New] FIRST-S00062 First Seen IP Address Connecting to Active Directory Certificate Services Process
    - This alert looks at Windows Filtering Platform Events and flags when a first seen IP address connects to the certificate services process. This can be indictive of enumeration of certificate templates which can potentially lead to forged certificates and privilege escalation avenues.
- [New] FIRST-S00086 First Seen IP Address Performing Trufflehog AWS Credential Verification
    - Trufflehog is a tool that can be utilized to find and verify secrets. When Trufflehog locates AWS credentials, it attempts to validate them using the GetCallerIdentity API call. This signal looks for the default Trufflehog User Agent within CloudTrail telemetry, combined with the GetCallerIdentity API call occurring from an IP address not seen since the baseline period.
- [New] FIRST-S00081 First Seen Model ID in AWS Bedrock Put Entitlement by User
    - A first seen model id was observed in AWS Bedrock. The PutFoundationModelEntitlement API call grants permission to put entitlement to access a foundational model.

- [New] FIRST-S00085 First Seen Role Creating AWS Bedrock Agent
    - An AWS Bedrock Agent has been created in the environment by a Role seen for the first time since the baseline period. If this role is not expected in the environment and was not originally assigned IAM rights to Bedrock, this activity could be indicative of privilege escalation.
- [New] FIRST-S00061 First Seen USB device in use on Windows host
    - This signal looks for a new removable USB device name being used by a host not seen since the baseline period. This activity by itself is not necessarily malicious, but can be indicative of potential lateral movement or initial access tactics.
- [New] FIRST-S00087 First Seen User Creating or Modifying EC2 Launch Template
    - AWS EC2 launch templates allows cloud administrators to specify instance configuration information in a templated format. Granting permissions to modify or create launch templates within EC2 in certain circumstances grants the user PassRole permissions, potentially opening privilege escalation avenues via IAM.
- [New] FIRST-S00082 First Seen User Enumerating AWS Bedrock Models
    - A first seen user was observed enumerating AWS Bedrock models via the ListFoundationModels API call. Ensure that the user performing the enumeration is authorized to work within AWS Bedrock.
- [New] FIRST-S00059 First Seen esentutl command From User
    - Threat actors may use the esentutl utility to create volume shadow copies and/or backups on a Windows operating system and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material.
- [New] FIRST-S00058 First Seen vssadmin command From User

### October 04, 2024 - Content Release

This content release includes:
* Detection rules centered around Amazon Bedrock activities.
* Consolidation of AWS CloudTrail mappers to replicate current mapper behavior with fewer distinct mappers.
* New support for GitHub Enterprise Audit (parsing and mapping).
* New support for Honeywell Pro-Watch (parsing and mapping).
* New support for Citrix Zendesk (parsing and mapping).
* Further mapping updates to better employ [Normalized Classification](/docs/cse/schema/cse-normalized-classification) fields across data sources.
* Removal of some duplicate mapped fields.
* Other changes enumerated below.

#### Rules
- [New] MATCH-S00921 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Logging Configuration Change Observed
    - An AWS Bedrock Model invocation logging configuration change was observed. Ensure that this activity is expected and authorized. Take a look at the full event details, particularly the requestParameters.loggingConfig* fields in order to see what specific configuration values were changed. Telemetry and logging configuration changes should be a relatively rare occurrence in the environment.
- [New] MATCH-S00922 AWS Bedrock Agent Created
    - This rule detects when an AWS Bedrock Agent has been created in the environment. Bedrock Agents can be configured with various parameters to build AI applications. Take a look at the "responseElements.agent.agentName" field to see the name of the agent being created. Ensure that the user creating the agent is authorized to develop AI applications within the environment.
- [New] MATCH-S00924 AWS Bedrock Guardrail Deleted
    - AWS Bedrock Guardrails provide users with the ability to configure options like filtering out harmful content or defining denied topics for models. Guardrails also allow the blocking of sensitive information such as PII. Ensure that this deletion was performed by an authorized user during an expected change. Look at other activity from this user account, focusing on the Bedrock service and pivoting from there if the event is deemed suspicious.
- [New] MATCH-S00923 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Denied for User
    - A user has attempted to invoke a model via AWS Bedrock for which access was denied due to a permission issue. This event can be a normal occurrence for a user who has not been provisioned the proper IAM resources for AWS Bedrock. However, it could also be a malicious attempt at running a particular model via AWS Bedrock. Take a look at the username, IP address, role type, role and model via the "requestParameters.modelId" field.
- [New] FIRST-S00081 First Seen Model ID in AWS Bedrock Put Entitlement by User
    - A first seen model id was observed in AWS Bedrock. The PutFoundationModelEntitlement API call grants permission to put entitlement to access a foundational model. Ensure this model is authorized to be utilized in the environment and that the user requesting access to the model is authorized to perform these actions.
- [New] FIRST-S00082 First Seen User Enumerating AWS Bedrock Models
    - A first seen user was observed enumerating AWS Bedrock models via the ListFoundationModels API call. Ensure that the user performing the enumeration is authorized to work within AWS Bedrock. The http_userAgent field will contain the user agent used to perform this enumeration and will help determine whether a browser or CLI tool was used to perform this type of enumeration. Consider excluding service accounts and authorized users from this rule via a rule tuning expression if excessive signal activity is observed.    
- [New] FIRST-S00084 - First Seen AWS Bedrock API Call from User
    - This rule looks for a first seen AWS Bedrock API call from a user since the baseline period. Ensure the user in question is authorized to utilize AWS Bedrock services. Look at the "action" field to determine what API calls are being made and whether this activity is expected.
- [New] FIRST-S00085 First Seen Role Creating AWS Bedrock Agent
    - An AWS Bedrock Agent has been created in the environment by a Role seen for the first time since the baseline period. If this role is not expected in the environment and was not originally assigned IAM rights to Bedrock, this activity could be indicative of privilege escalation. Bedrock Agents can be configured with various parameters to build AI applications. Take a look at the "responseElements.agent.agentName" field to see the name of the agent being created. Ensure that the user creating the agent is authorized to develop AI applications within the environment.
- [New] FIRST-S00086 First Seen IP Address Performing Trufflehog AWS Credential Verification
    - Trufflehog is a tool that can be utilized to find and verify secrets. When Trufflehog locates AWS credentials, it attempts to validate them using the GetCallerIdentity API call. This signal looks for the default Trufflehog User Agent within CloudTrail telemetry, combined with the GetCallerIdentity API call occurring from an IP address not seen since the baseline period. This signal is designed to pair with “Trufflehog AWS Credential Verification Detected” to provide coverage for legitimate and internal Trufflehog scans. Within this telemetry, the user_username field will contain the value of the username associated with the secret or credential that Trufflehog is attempting to verify. Look at the events surrounding the source IP address of this event. Look for any potential areas that may have contained keys or secrets for the user_username value.
- [New] FIRST-S00087 First Seen User Creating or Modifying EC2 Launch Template
    - AWS EC2 launch templates allows cloud administrators to specify instance configuration information in a templated format. Granting permissions to modify or create launch templates within EC2 in certain circumstances grants the user PassRole permissions, potentially opening privilege escalation avenues via IAM. The following AWS documentation outlines this behavior: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/permissions-for-launch-templates.html. Look at other events the user in question is performing in order to investigate this signal. Consider excluding authorized users via a match list if this signal is triggering too many false positives.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00019 Outlier in AWS Bedrock API Calls from User
    - An outlier in the number of API calls made to AWS Bedrock from a user within an hour time period was observed. These events may be part of normal Bedrock operations or may be indicative of enumeration/discovery attempts. Observe the username, role, user agent and source IP to confirm whether this activity is expected. If this signal is triggering frequently, consider excluding certain authorized users via tuning expression.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00022 Outlier in AWS Bedrock Foundation Model Enumeration Calls from User 
    - An outlier in the number of Foundation Model Enumeration API Calls from a user within an hour time period was observed. These events may be part of normal Bedrock operations or may be indicative of enumeration/discovery attempts. Observe the username, role, user agent and source IP to confirm whether this activity is expected. If this signal is triggering frequently, consider excluding certain authorized users via tuning expression.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00024 - AWS DynamoDB Outlier in GetItem Events from User
    - An outlier in GetItem events to a DynamoDB resource within an hour time period has been detected. Ensure that the user performing these actions has business justification for modifying DynamoDB tables and instances. Consider excluding authorized users from this signal or tweaking the minimum count value if this signal is triggering too often. Data events from DynamoDB are required in order for this signal to function.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00025 - AWS S3 Outlier in PutObject Denied Events
    - This rule utilizes an hourly baseline to detect an outlier in the number of denied PutObject access events to an S3 bucket. AWS Data events are necessary for this signal to function. Denied PutObject access events can stem from IAM policies or bucket policies. Look at the user, role, IP address from the events to determine whether this activity is expected. In certain cases, access denied events to S3 can also result in unexpected AWS charges.
- [New] MATCH-S00925 Trufflehog AWS Credential Verification Detected
    - Trufflehog is a tool that can be utilized to find and verify secrets. When Trufflehog locates AWS credentials, it attempts to validate them using the GetCallerIdentity API call. This signal looks for the default Trufflehog User Agent within CloudTrail telemetry, combined with the GetCallerIdentity API call. Within this telemetry, the user_username field will contain the value of the username associated with the secret or credential that Trufflehog is attempting to verify. Look at the events surrounding the source IP address of this event. Look for any potential areas that may have contained keys or secrets for the user_username value.

### August 27, 2024 - Content Release

This release reverts a change to our AWS CloudTrail default (catch all) mapper for how `user_username` is mapped. This is being reverted due to reports of breaking rule tuning and missing user context for some `AssumedRole` events.

AWS `AssumedRole` events can contain service and user role assumptions. Oftentimes service role assumptions will contain a dynamic session identifier instead of a static user identifer which contains the originating identity. Prior to the change we are now reverting, this was causing certain services to generate user entities from these sessions, creating false positives. This behavior changed with the [August 5th, 2024 content release](/release-notes-cse/#august-5-2024---content-release) to handle role assumptions to instead map the role as user to prevent false positives from dynamic service sessions. While this decreased the number of false positives from dynamic service sessions, it also eliminated visibility into user role assumptions, creating potential for false negatives.

AWS best practices suggest defining `sourceIdentity` to allow for the originating user for a role assumption to be identifiable. This is the best path to avoid false positive generation, as our mapper will favor `sourceIdentity` if it is present in CloudTrail logs. If it is not present, then `userIdentity.arn` will be used and the `resource-id` will be mapped to `user_username`, creating potential for false positives from dynamic session identifiers. See [Viewing source identity in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html#id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor-ct) in the AWS documentation for more information.

Alternatively, known service accounts which generate dynamic sessions identifers can be tuned out from signals using rule tuning expressions, Field Extraction Rules (FERs), or at the CloudTrail parser to reduce potential for false positive signals.

---
### May 23, 2024 - Content Release

This release includes new Cloud SIEM detection rules, and updates to existing rules to correct summary and description expressions. All changes are enumerated below.

#### Rules

* [New] FIRST-S00061 First Seen USB device in use on Windows host
    * This signal looks for a new removable USB device name being used by a host not seen since the baseline period. This activity by itself is not necessarily malicious, but can be indicative of potential lateral movement or initial access tactics. If the device name is unexpected and not authorized to be used in the environment, investigate the alert further and look for file creation events to the drive in question. The `fields["EventData.DeviceDescription"]` field contains the device name.
* [New] FIRST-S00059 First Seen esentutl command From User
    * Threat actors may use the esentutl utility to create volume shadow copies and/or backups on a Windows operating system, and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material. Esentutl can also be utilized to download files from a remote share or URL. This activity should be treated as high priority if not performed by an authorized systems administrator as part of normal and planned systems maintenance.
* [New] FIRST-S00058 First Seen vssadmin command From User
    * Threat actors may use the vssadmin utility to create volume shadow copies on a Windows operating system, and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material. This activity should be treated as high priority if not performed by an authorized systems administrator as part of normal and planned systems maintenance. If this activity is performed as part of normal system maintenance, the rule can be tuned to exclude these groups of users.
* [New] FIRST-S00060 First Seen wbadmin command From User
    * Threat actors may use the wbadmin utility to create volume shadow copies and/or backups on a Windows operating system, and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material. This activity should be treated as high priority if not performed by an authorized systems administrator as part of normal and planned systems maintenance.
* [New] MATCH-S00908 Okta - MFA Request Denied by User
    * This signal will trigger when a user denies an MFA request within the Okta authenticator application. Examine other authentication attempts for this particular user, and undertake confirmation efforts to ensure that this activity is expected and valid.
* [New] MATCH-S00907 Okta - Policy Rule Added
    * This rule looks for an Okta application being created. Ensure that this activity is expected and authorized. Only Okta administrators should be creating applications. Check the Okta administrator portal for more details regarding the application in question such as scopes and access levels. The field `fields["target.1.alternateId"]` contains the name of the application that was created
* [New] MATCH-S00905 Okta - Programmatic Access to Users API Endpoint
    * This signal looks for programmatic (PowerShell, Golang, Python or Curl) access to the Okta users API endpoint. This endpoint provides functionality to perform various actions on Okta user accounts such as password resets and account unlocks. A full list of functionality for this endpoint can be found in the Okta documentation [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/). The `\u201cSuccess\u201d` field will indicate whether this API request was successful or not, and the `\u201cDescription\u201d` field will contain the event that was generated by the API request. Both failed and successful requests should be investigated. Ensure that this request was performed for legitimate purposes such as developer workflows or other automation mechanisms. Consider adding a match list exclusion with authorized accounts who perform requests to this Okta API endpoint via programmatic methods if this signal is triggering false positives.
* [New] MATCH-S00917 Suspicious PowerShell Application Window Discovery COM method
    * This PowerShell COM method allows for discovery of running application windows, along with the process path and window location coordinates. Investigation of the host is recommended to identify the behavior leading to and around the execution of this PowerShell process.
* [New] MATCH-S00920 Suspicious PowerShell Window Discovery Cmdlet execution
    * Detects the use of PowerShell for Application Window Discovery to identify open application windows to gather information on running programs, collect potential data, and discover security tooling. Investigation into the host and user to identify the process executing the PowerShell function. See [here](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/enumeration-and-discovery/t1010-application-window-discovery) for reference.
* [New] MATCH-S00918 Suspicious cat of PAM common-password policy
    * The Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) in Linux allows system administrators to choose how applications authenticate users. The common-password file defines behavior of password use in Linux subsystems. This detection looks for use of cat to display the contents of the common-password file, which should not be a common occurrence on systems. It is recommended to investigate the host upon which this detection occurs to understand the exposure of the password policies for the system.
* [New] MATCH-S00919 chage command use on host
    * The chage command on Linux allows for the changing of user password expiry information. The chage command is restricted to the root user; however, non-root/unprivileged users may use the `-l` flag to determine when the user's password or account is due to expire. It is recommended to investigate the system and account the command has been executed on, to assess the intent of this execution. Additionally, looking at the command line and parent process is helpful in identifying valid automated processes executing this command that would benefit from tuning out via Rule Tuning.

### May 15, 2024 - Application Update

#### Rule-Based Signal Suppression

We've added an advanced rule feature that allows users to override the global signal suppression period. This is most useful for individual rules that require much shorter (or no) suppression, such as rules that pass alerts through from external data sources such as endpoint detection systems.

This setting can be accessed from the rule details page:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/csiem-rule-signal-suppression.jpg')} alt="Rule-Level Signal Suppression Settings in Cloud SIEM"/>

The setting is in the "Show Advanced" section. You can specify a suppression period for the rule between 0 and 168 hours (if you set it to 0, suppression is completely disabled for the rule).

#### Minor Changes and Enhancements

* Users can now view the MITRE ATT&amp;CK&reg; Threat Coverage Explorer with only the View Rules permission; previously users had to have the Manage Rules permission to access the Explorer.

#### Bug Fixes

* Some system events that automatically occur after an Insight is created (such as enrichment, automation service calls, and so on) were not consistently executing.
* Some system events that automatically occur just before rule processing (such as adding Geo IP and ASN data, checking match lists, and so on) were not consistently executing.
* Users were unable to duplicate rules due to an internal error.

### April 11, 2024 - Application Update

#### MITRE ATT&amp;CK&reg; Coverage Enhancements

We're excited to announce multiple enhancements to our MITRE ATT&amp;CK Threat Coverage Explorer.

* **Rules Filtering** - You can now easily filter the coverage visualization based on rules, including out-of-the-box and user-created rules, as well as enabled, disabled, production and prototype rules.
* **All Community Activity** - This view now defaults to show only the vendor and product logs that are being sent to Cloud SIEM from your data sources. This gives you a better comparison between what your theoretical and historical coverage shows and what other customers of Cloud SIEM using those same log sources are seeing. You can still change the filter to display other (or all) log sources.
* **Customizable Colors** - You can now customize the tile colors to your own scheme. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/mitre-attack-explorer-custom-colors.jpg')} alt="Custom MITRE ATT&amp;CK Explorer Color Palette"/>

For full details, see the [MITRE ATT&amp;CK Coverage documentation](/docs/cse/administration/mitre-coverage/).

#### New UI Themes for Cloud SIEM

We are also excited to announce that Cloud SIEM now supports two different UI themes: the default "dark" theme, and a new "light" theme:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/csiem-light-dark-theme.jpg')} alt="Light and Dark theme examples in Cloud SIEM"/>

The theme is set per user, and can be changed on the Sumo Logic user preferences page:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/cse/theme-setting.png')} alt="Option to change UI theme"/>

Note that the setting currently only affects Cloud SIEM and the Automation Service, but in the future this setting will also affect other pages in the Sumo Logic UI.

#### Bug fixes

* Terraform no longer times out while waiting for match lists to be updated.

### March 22, 2024 - Application Update


#### Minor changes and enhancements

* Two enhancements have been implemented for the MITRE ATT&amp;CK&reg; Threat Coverage Explorer:
  * The current tactic, technique and sub-technique metrics for the (default) Theoretical and Historical views are now written to the `sumologic_system_events` audit logs daily. This data can be used in dashboards to track coverage and events over time.
  * It is now possible, using the `/mitre-attack/json` endpoint, to extract the MITRE Explorer-formatted JSON via API. (This works the same as the **Export** button in the UI.)
* On the Insight details page, on the Entities tab, the default view is now the Graph view instead of the List view.
* Threat reputation icons/labels are now visible in a number of additional places throughout the UI. These can be set via enrichment.

#### Bug fixes

* In some cases, events that are supposed to occur automatically after an Insight is opened were not executing, or were severely delayed.
* If an Insight comment included a long URL, text wrapping was not behaving correctly and some text was being clipped from view. Also, newline characters were not always being honored properly in comments.

### February 19, 2024 - Application Update

#### Minor changes and enhancements

* [New] Continuing our work to better align the Cloud SIEM UI pages with Log Analytics UI pages to improve usability and provide a consistent user experience, the color palette has been adjusted slightly, some page decoration has been removed or altered, and some controls have been updated.
* [New] On the Entity list page, you can now filter by reputation indicator (i.e. Malicious, Suspicious or NotFlagged).
* [New] Users can now navigate directly from the Entity Activity panel on the HUD to the Entity List page, with the proper filter pre-applied.
* [Updated] The `Object Type` attribute has been added back to the Signal summary section, next to the timestamp, so that it is visible whether the Signal details are expanded or collapsed.
* [New] A user-editable **Description** field has been added to Rule Tuning Expressions.

#### Bug fixes

* Sorting by value was not working properly on the Entities list page.
* Sometimes, if the target value was left blank (default), domain normalization would append a colon to the resulting value.
* Customers were experiencing rate limiting with VirusTotal due to a change to their API and constant retries due to resultant errors in Cloud SIEM. This has been resolved, as has an issue with enrichments for file hashes.
* Some Entities were not showing as being included in Entity Groups properly (even though attributes had been set correctly).
* The MITRE ATT&CK<super>&reg;</super> `stage` attribute was missing from some Signals in the audit logs.
* Custom inventory sources were not included in the appropriate dropdown in Entity Group configuration.
* On the Entity Details page, if the only Signals that existed were in Prototype mode, they would not be visible.
* The reputation indicator on the Entity Details page was being rendered, then hidden.
