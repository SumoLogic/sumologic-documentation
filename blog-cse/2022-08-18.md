#### Resolved Issues

* Several issues were resolved related to the bulk upload of Entity attributes, including errors with CSV file parsing, editing uploaded attributes in the UI, and a lack of audit logging.
* On the Entity details page, the criticality was not being displayed properly.
Labels were not being created properly based on Network Blocks for a small number of customers.
* **InsightCommentCreated** audit events did not include the `readableId` attribute.
* For some record types, the `Actions` field was not being displayed if selected as a favorite field.
