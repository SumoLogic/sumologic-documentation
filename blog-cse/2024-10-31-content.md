Please be advised that rule FIRST-S00031 (First Seen IP Address Associated with User for a Successful Azure AD Sign In Event) is not performing as intended and will be decommissioned in a forthcoming release. Please use FIRST-S00047 (First Seen ASN Associated with User for a Successful Azure AD Sign In Event) which provides an accurate and less sensitive detection point.

## Rules

- [New] MATCH-S00922 AWS Bedrock Agent Created.
    - This rule detects when an AWS Bedrock Agent has been created in the environment.
    Bedrock Agents can be configured with various parameters to build AI applications.
- [New] MATCH-S00924 AWS Bedrock Guardrail Deleted.
    - AWS Bedrock Guardrails provide users with the ability to configure options like filtering out harmful content or defining denied topics for models. Guardrails also allow the blocking of sensitive information such as PII. Ensure that this deletion was performed by an authorized user during an expected change.
- [New] MATCH-S00923 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Denied for User.
    - A user has attempted to invoke a model via AWS Bedrock for which access was denied due to a permission issue. This event can be a normal occurrence for a user who has not been provisioned the proper IAM resources for AWS Bedrock.
- [New] MATCH-S00921 AWS Bedrock Model Invocation Logging Configuration Change Observed.
    - An AWS Bedrock Model invocation logging configuration change was observed. Ensure that this activity is expected and authorized.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00024 AWS DynamoDB Outlier in GetItem Events from User.
    - An outlier in GetItem events to a DynamoDB resource within an hour time period has been detected. Ensure that the user performing these actions has business justification for modifying DynamoDB tables and instances.
- [New] OUTLIER-S00025 AWS S3 Outlier in PutObject Denied Events
    - This rule utilizes an hourly baseline to detect an outlier in the number of denied PutObject access events to an S3 bucket. AWS Data events are necessary for this signal to function.
- [New] MATCH-S00390 Attempted Credential Dump From Registry Via Reg.Exe
    - Monitors for use of reg.exe with parameters indicating the attempted export of hashed credentials.
Audit Object Access (success and failure) must be enabled for this rule to function.
- [New] MATCH-S00896 Azure Authentication Policy Change
    - Various authentication related policy configurations exist within Azure. These are tenant-wide policy changes that affect aspects such as enabling of number matching, changing of which authentication methods users are allowed to use, or the exclusion of certain groups from various authentication methods.
- [New] MATCH-S00525 Credential Dumping Via Copy Command From Shadow Copy
    - This rule detects credential dumping using copy command from a shadow copy.
- [New] FIRST-S00084 First Seen AWS Bedrock API Call from User
    - This rule looks for a first seen AWS Bedrock API call from a user since the baseline period. Ensure the user in question is authorized to utilize AWS Bedrock services.
- [New] FIRST-S00062 First Seen IP Address Connecting to Active Directory Certificate Services Process
    - This alert looks at Windows Filtering Platform Events and flags when a first seen IP address connects to the certificate services process. This can be indictive of enumeration of certificate templates which can potentially lead to forged certificates and privilege escalation avenues.
- [New] FIRST-S00086 First Seen IP Address Performing Trufflehog AWS Credential Verification
    - Trufflehog is a tool that can be utilized to find and verify secrets. When Trufflehog locates AWS credentials, it attempts to validate them using the GetCallerIdentity API call. This signal looks for the default Trufflehog User Agent within CloudTrail telemetry, combined with the GetCallerIdentity API call occurring from an IP address not seen since the baseline period.
- [New] FIRST-S00081 First Seen Model ID in AWS Bedrock Put Entitlement by User
    - A first seen model id was observed in AWS Bedrock. The PutFoundationModelEntitlement API call grants permission to put entitlement to access a foundational model.

    - A user has performed NTLM authentication to a host on the network for the first time since the baseline period has been established.
- [New] FIRST-S00076 First Seen Net Command Use on Host
- [New] FIRST-S00085 First Seen Role Creating AWS Bedrock Agent

- [New] FIRST-S00061 First Seen USB device in use on Windows host
    - This signal looks for a new removable USB device name being used by a host not seen since the baseline period. This activity by itself is not necessarily malicious, but can be indicative of potential lateral movement or initial access tactics.
- [New] FIRST-S00087 First Seen User Creating or Modifying EC2 Launch Template
    - AWS EC2 launch templates allows cloud administrators to specify instance configuration information in a templated format. Granting permissions to modify or create launch templates within EC2 in certain circumstances grants the user PassRole permissions, potentially opening privilege escalation avenues via IAM.
- [New] FIRST-S00082 First Seen User Enumerating AWS Bedrock Models
    - A first seen user was observed enumerating AWS Bedrock models via the ListFoundationModels API call. Ensure that the user performing the enumeration is authorized to work within AWS Bedrock.
- [New] FIRST-S00059 First Seen esentutl command From User
    - Threat actors may use the esentutl utility to create volume shadow copies and/or backups on a Windows operating system and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material.
- [New] FIRST-S00058 First Seen vssadmin command From User
    - Threat actors may use the vssadmin utility to create volume shadow copies on a Windows operating system and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material.
- [New] FIRST-S00060 First Seen wbadmin command From User
    - Threat actors may use the wbadmin utility to create volume shadow copies and/or backups on a Windows operating system and retrieve the Active Directory database (NTDS.dit) file in order to extract credential material.
