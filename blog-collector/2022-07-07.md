* [In Sumo Logic](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors.md)
* [Command Line](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors.md)
* [Collector Management API](/docs/api/collectors#Upgrade-or-Downgrade-Collectors-Using-the-API)

:::note
Our [static URLs](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/collector-installation-reference/download-collector-from-static-url) are available to download the most recent Collector version.
