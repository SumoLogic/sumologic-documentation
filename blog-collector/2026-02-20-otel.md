We’re excited to announce that you can now migrate Installed Collector (IC) local file sources to OpenTelemetry (OTEL) source templates to provide a more modern, scalable, and consistent data collection experience. This migration helps future-proof your setup, making it easier to manage collectors at scale while benefiting from ongoing OTEL improvements and support.
