Sumo Logic has been using Java 8 for its Installed Collectors until now. However, with Java 8 reaching its end of public updates in January 2019, and with newer Java versions offering significant improvements in both performance and security, we are upgrading our Installed Collectors to Java 17. This upgrade will provide enhanced functionality, better security patches, and overall improved system efficiency.

Starting January 31, 2026, Sumo Logic will no longer support the collectors using Java Runtime Environment (JRE) versions older than 17. To ensure continued compatibility and support, upgrade your collectors to JRE 17 or later before this date. [Learn more](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors/#upgradecollectors-to-the-latest-build).
