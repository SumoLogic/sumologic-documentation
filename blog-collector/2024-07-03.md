- Known issues when upgrading to this version:
  - **Collector running as non-root user**. Collector running as non-root user (run as mode) cannot be upgraded through the API/Web UI. It display an error message indicating that the upgrade is not possible. The upgrade must be performed manually on your machine. Follow the [steps to upgrade manually](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors/#upgrade-collectors-using-the-command-line).
  - **Collector running on Mac**. Collector running on a Mac operating system cannot be upgraded through the API/Web UI. The process will stop, and the collector will need to be restarted manually on your machine if upgraded using API or Web UI. Use the below code to manually restart.
    ```
    sudo ./collector start
    ```

### Bug Fix

- Fixed the collector start issue by cleaning the temporary files on Windows.
- Fixed the issue with starting the collector on Linux RHEL OS (version 8.3 and above) with OS-level FIPS mode enabled.
