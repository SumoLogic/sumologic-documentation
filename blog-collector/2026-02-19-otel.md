We’re excited to announce that the OpenTelemetry collector installation files can now be downloaded from a CDN for Chef, Puppet, and Ansible. This change improves download reliability, performance, and availability while maintaining the same installation experience.

As part of this update, the download URLs for Chef, Ansible, and Puppet are listed below.

```
https://download-otel.sumologic.com/latest/download/ansible-playbook.tar.gz
https://download-otel.sumologic.com/latest/download/puppet-module.tar.gz
https://download-otel.sumologic.com/latest/download/chef-cookbook.tar.gz
```

:::note
- Existing OpenTelemetry binaries and other packages remain in their current locations.
- This change does not affect the UI itself. The download process looks the same, but the underlying URL now uses a CDN to improve reliability and speed.
