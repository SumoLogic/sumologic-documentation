We’re excited to announce that the OpenTelemetry collector installation files can now be downloaded from a CDN for Chef, Puppet, and Ansible. This change improves download reliability, performance, and availability while maintaining the same installation experience.

Refer to the following documentation to view the updated URLs in the UI.
- [Ansible](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector/ansible/)
- [Chef](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector/chef/)
- [Puppet](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector/puppet/)

:::note
- Existing OpenTelemetry binaries and other packages remain in their current locations.
- This change does not affect the UI itself. The download process looks the same, but the underlying URL now uses a CDN to improve reliability and speed.
