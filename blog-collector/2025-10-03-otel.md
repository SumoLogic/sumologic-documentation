Weâ€™re pleased to announce a new method for downloading the latest version of our OpenTelemetry collectors for Linux, macOS, and Windows. While the static URL method is still available, you now have the option to use a CDN URL via UI for better performance.

:::info
This change does not affect the UI itself. The download process looks the same, but the underlying URL now uses a CDN to improve reliability and speed.
