In this release, we've enhanced the security and stability of the Collector with added support for security patches.

### Security Fixes

- Upgraded `Tanuki version` to version 3.5.60 to fix the collector intermittently crashing issue.
- Upgraded collector JRE to **Amazon Corretto Version 8.432.06.1**.

### Troubleshooting

When upgrading this collector version, collector running as non-root user (run as mode) or on a Mac operating system cannot be upgraded through the API/Web UI. To resolve these issue, follow the respective steps below:
    - **Collector running as non-root user.** An error message will be displayed indicating that the upgrade is not possible. The upgrade must be performed manually on your machine. Refer to the [Upgrade Collectors in Sumo Logic](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors/#upgrade-collectors-using-the-command-line) to upgrade the collector manually.
    - **Collector running on Mac.** The process will stop while upgrading, and the collector will need to be restarted manually on your machine. Use the below code to manually restart.
        ```
        sudo ./collector start
        ```
