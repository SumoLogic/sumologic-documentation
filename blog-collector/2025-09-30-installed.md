Sumo Logic has been using Java 8 for its Installed Collectors until now. However, with Java 8 reaching its end of public updates in January 2019, and with newer Java versions offering significant improvements in both performance and security, we are upgrading our Installed Collectors to Java 17. This upgrade will provide enhanced functionality, better security patches, and overall improved system efficiency.

If you're running a collector with your own custom JRE, ensure the JRE version is 17 or higher. If not, upgrade to Java 17 or a more recent version. [Learn more](/docs/send-data/collection/upgrade-collectors/#upgradecollectors-to-the-latest-build).
