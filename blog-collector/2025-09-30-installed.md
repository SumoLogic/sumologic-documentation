Sumo Logic has used Java 8 for Installed Collectors until now. Since Java 8 reached end of public updates in January 2019 and newer versions offer better performance and security, we are upgrading Installed Collectors to use Java 17.

If you're using a custom bundled JRE, ensure it's newer than Java 8. If not, upgrade to Java 17 or a more recent version.
