In this release, we've enhanced the security and stability of Collector with added support for security patches and bug fixes.

**Security Fix**
 * Upgraded collector JRE to **Amazon Corretto Version 8.362.08.1**.
 * Upgraded bouncy castle library `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on` to **Version 1.69** to enhance the security functionality by providing new cryptographic algorithms, digital signature support, and other security enhancements.
 * Upgraded the Java-based framework `jersey-common` to **Version 2.38** to improve the performance and stability of the RESTful web services.
 * Upgraded `docker-java` to **Version 3.2.12** to receive the important security updates and bug fixes to the Docker API client library

**Bug Fixes**
 * Improved hostname handling by retrieving default value from host when DNS query fails.
 * JSON special characters in Active Directory objects now properly represented in JSON format for reliable application performance.
