Weâ€™re pleased to announce a new method for downloading the latest version of our installed collectors. While the static URL method is still available, you now have the option to use a CDN URL via UI for better performance.

:::info
This change does not affect the UI itself. The download process looks the same, but the underlying URL now uses a CDN to improve reliability and speed.
