In this release, we've enhanced the security and stability of Collector with added support for security patch and bug fix.

## Security Fix

- Upgraded collector JRE to **Amazon Corretto Version 8.382.05.1**.
- When installed collector sends data to the backend receiver use `zstd compression` to improve the speed and compression rate.
- Upgraded `org.xerial.snappy:snappy-java` to version 1.1.10.1 to address the known security vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-34455, CVE-2023-34453, and CVE-2023-34454).

## Bug Fix

- Removed irrelevant `ERROR_EVT_MESSAGE_NOT_FOUND` found in the collector.log.
- Fixed the Docker duplication issue.
