We're happy to announce that Sumo Logic now enables you to remotely update the collector timezone for OpenTelemetry collectors through the UI in the OpenTelemetry collector edit flow. You can select the timezone of your choice while editing the collector. If you do not make a selection, the timezone will be set to `(UTC) Etc/UTC` by default.
