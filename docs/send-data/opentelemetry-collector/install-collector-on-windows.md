Follow the steps in this topic to install or uninstall an OpenTelemetry Collector on macOS. See [OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector) for information on other operating systems.

## System Requirements

TODO - add some info about system and hardware


## Install

You can install our OpenTelemetry Collector using either of the following methods:

* [Install script](#install-script)
* [Manual step-by-step installation](#manual-step-by-step-installation)

### Install Script

A single line installation powered by Install Script.

#### Get the Installation Token

Get your [installation token](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/installation-tokens) if you don't have it already and assign it to environment variable.

```bash
export SUMOLOGIC_INSTALLATION_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
```

#### Run Installation Script

You can run the script in two ways:

* by piping `curl` straight into `bash`:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo -E bash -s
```

* by first downloading the script, inspecting its contents for security, and then running it.

```bash
curl -o install-otelcol-sumo.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/main/scripts/install.sh`sudo -E bash ./install-otelcol-sumo.sh`
```

The `-E` argument to sudo is needed to preserve the `SUMOLOGIC_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` environment variable in `sudo` session. It is going to perform the following operations:
* install or upgrade operation by placing the latest version as `/usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo`
* get [static configuration](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/blob/main/examples/sumologic.yaml) and place it as `/etc/otelcol-sumo/sumologic.yaml`
* create user configuration directory (`/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d`) with `common.yaml` file which will contain installation token
* configure Systemd:
  * the script will retrieve the [Systemd service configuration](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/blob/main/examples/systemd/otelcol-sumo.service) and place it as `/etc/systemd/system/otelcol-sumo.service`
  * create a `otelcol-sumo` user and group which will be used to run the service
  * enable `otelcol-sumo` service
  * start `otelcol-sumo` service
