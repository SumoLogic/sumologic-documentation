---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

OpenTelemetry Collector is our next-generation collector, built on OpenTelemetry, that provides a single unified agent to send Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Metadata for Observability to Sumo Logic. This can help simplify and streamline the process of monitoring and understanding the performance and behavior of complex distributed systems, making it easier to identify and diagnose issues and improve overall system reliability and efficiency.

What makes the Sumo Logic OTel Collector unique is its flexibility and scalability. It can be easily deployed as a containerized application on any cloud platform, and it supports a wide range of data sources, including AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Jaeger. This means that organizations can use the collector to gain deeper visibility into their distributed systems, no matter where they are hosted.

Once the data is collected, the Sumo Logic platform provides powerful analytics capabilities, enabling users to gain insights into their applications and systems, troubleshoot issues, and optimize their operations. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, the Sumo Logic OTel Collector is an ideal choice for organizations looking to gain a deeper understanding of their distributed systems and improve their overall performance and reliability.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Logs collection

The following benchmark has been compiled on an Amazon `m4.large`
instance, which has 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory available.

It can be used when estimating the required CPU resources for logs collection
using [`filelogreceiver`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).


### CPU usage guidelines

#### Benchmark - CPU usage for particular average message size and EPS

Measured CPU usage for particular Events Per Second (EPS) average message size.

|          | 100B  | 512B  |  1KB   |  5KB   |  10KB  |
|:---------|:------|:------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| **EPS**  |   -   |   -   |   -    |   -    |   -    |
| **100**  | 1.14% |  1%   | 1.01%  |  1.4%  | 3.78%  |
| **200**  | 1.29% | 1.4%  | 1.41%  | 2.57%  | 5.36%  |
| **500**  | 2.75% | 2.71% | 2.95%  |  5.7%  | 10.68% |
| **1000** | 4.74% | 5.07% | 5.32%  | 11.3%  | 20.12% |
| **1500** | 7.08% | 7.29% | 7.99%  | 16.93% | 27.96% |
| **2000** | 9.64% | 9.56% | 10.39% | 22.51% | 36.59% |

#### Benchmark - EPS for average message size and CPU usage

Events Per Second (EPS) achieved for a particular average message size and CPU usage.

|                       | 100B  | 512B  | 1KB  | 5KB  | 10KB |
|:----------------------|:------|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| **Average CPU usage** |   -   |   -   |  -   |  -   |  -   |
|        **5%**         | 2000  | 1100  | 1000 | 150  | 200  |
|        **10%**        | 3500  | 2100  | 1500 | 450  | 300  |
|        **20%**        | 6500  | 4100  | 3000 | 1200 | 700  |
|        **50%**        | 14000 | 10100 | 8500 |  -<sup>*</sup>  |  -<sup>*</sup>  |
|        **90%**        |  -<sup>*</sup>   | 19100 |  -<sup>*</sup>  |  -<sup>*</sup>  |  -<sup>*</sup>  |

<sup>*</sup> Cells without a resulting EPS come from the fact that the CPU utilization didn't reach the designated CPU utilization during the benchmark run.<br/><br/>

Using the information from the above table, if you had an average CPU usage of 5%:
* 10 KB logs can be ingested at 200 logs/sec (2000 KB/sec).
* 1 KB logs can be ingested at 1000 logs/sec (1000 KB/sec).

This shows that the collector performs better when it is made to ingest bigger
log entries (which is expected due to less overhead coming from timestamp parsing, etc.).

### Memory usage guidelines

#### Benchmark - memory usage for particular average message size and EPS

Measured memory usage (in MB) for particular Events Per Second (EPS) average message size.

|          |  100B  |  512B  |  1KB   |  5KB   |  10KB  |
|:---------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| **EPS**  |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |
| **100**  | 113.14 | 116.16 | 117.1  | 116.99 | 112.59 |
| **200**  | 115.16 | 118.55 | 116.8  | 119.67 | 127.02 |
| **500**  | 118.24 | 121.79 | 122.78 | 127.87 | 142.73 |
| **1000** | 121.6  | 126.75 | 127.94 | 140.11 | 106.82 |
| **1500** | 128.54 | 131.9  | 137.69 | 95.21  | 113.89 |
| **2000** | 130.62 | 125.27 | 144.59 | 98.62  | 134.61 |


## Fine Tuning Performance

There are a couple configuration options that can help with performance in specific scenarios.

### Sumo Logic Exporter

The [Sumo Logic Exporter](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/main/pkg/exporter/sumologicexporter)
sends data to Sumo Logic.

It has the following features that can help with performance:

- `retry_on_failure` with its `initial_interval`, `max_interval` and `max_elapsed_time` settings,
- `sending_queue` with its `num_consumers`, `queue_size` settings,
- `timeout`.

Read more about these features in the [Sumo Logic Exporter docs](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/main/pkg/exporter/sumologicexporter/README.md).

### Batch Processor

The [Batch Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/batchprocessor) joins records of each type in batches.

It has the following features that can help with performance:

- `send_batch_size`,
- `send_batch_max_size`,
- `timeout`.

Read more about these features in the [Batch Processor docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/batchprocessor/README.md).

### Memory Limiter Processor

The [Memory Limiter Processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/memorylimiterprocessor) prevents out-of-memory crashes for the collector process
by monitoring the amount of memory used by the collector and forcing it to lower its memory consumption.

Read more about its features in the [Memory Limiter Processor docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/memorylimiterprocessor/README.md).
