Prometheus, a popular tool for monitoring application performance, provides a flexible query language and wide range of integrations with various systems. Once you have collected metrics with Prometheus, it can be challenging to visualize and analyze that data in a single location.

You can use our OpenTelemetry Collector to import your Prometheus-formatted metrics into Sumo Logic and create a custom dashboard for them.

This diagram shows the flow of metrics data from a custom application which has been instrumented to provide Prometheus-formatted metrics. The metrics are scraped by the Open Telemetry Collector using the `prometheus` receiver, then sent to Sumo Logic’s OLTP-compatible ingest API via the `sumologic` exporter. The data is stored and indexed by Sumo Logic, where it can then be queried and displayed in a custom dashboard within Sumo Logic.

In this example, we use a simple simulator to provide some custom metrics, but you can use anything that exports metrics in Prometheus format. Prometheus is just the most convenient format to use here, but there are receivers for all popular metrics formats, so it should work for whatever your device is producing.


## Step 1: Set up the Prometheus Metrics Server Simulator

To get started, we need to have some Prometheus-formatted metrics to work with. We will use the [IBM Prometheus Metrics Server Simulator](https://github.com/IBM/prometheus-metrics-server-simulator) to generate sample metrics. You can install the simulator by following the instructions in the official repository.

Once you have installed the simulator, start it up with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
-v $(pwd)/example:/etc/conf \
-it ibmcom/prometheus-metrics-server-simulator
```

This will start the simulator with default configuration:

```bash
cat examples/config.yaml
counters:
  - prefix: mock_metric_counter
    number: 3
    labels:
    - name: app
      valueset:
      - "prometheus-mock-metrics-server"
    - name: client_addr
      valueset:
      - "client1"
      - "client2"
      - "client3"
  - prefix: mock_metric_request_total
    labels:
    - name: app
      valueset:
      - "prometheus-mock-metrics-server"
    valuemode: http

gauges:
  - prefix: mock_metric_gauges
    number: 4
    range:
      upper: 1000
      lower: 2
    labels:
    - name: app
      valueset:
      - "prometheus-mock-metrics-server"
    - name: client_addr
      valueset:
      - "client1"
      - "client2"
      - "client3"%
```

Of course you can modify that configuration to produce whatever custom metrics you want to mock.

You can verify that it is up and running by curling the metrics endpoint to see the Prometheus formatted metrics it is generating. You should see something like this:

```bash
curl localhost:8080/metrics
# HELP mock_metric_counter_0
# TYPE mock_metric_counter_0 counter
mock_metric_counter_0{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client3"} 5448
# HELP mock_metric_counter_1
# TYPE mock_metric_counter_1 counter
mock_metric_counter_1{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client2"} 5424
# HELP mock_metric_counter_2
# TYPE mock_metric_counter_2 counter
mock_metric_counter_2{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client2"} 5362
# HELP mock_metric_gauges_0
# TYPE mock_metric_gauges_0 gauge
mock_metric_gauges_0{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client1"} 71
# HELP mock_metric_gauges_1
# TYPE mock_metric_gauges_1 gauge
mock_metric_gauges_1{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client2"} 44
# HELP mock_metric_gauges_2
# TYPE mock_metric_gauges_2 gauge
mock_metric_gauges_2{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client3"} 4
# HELP mock_metric_gauges_3
# TYPE mock_metric_gauges_3 gauge
mock_metric_gauges_3{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server",client_addr="client3"} 41
# HELP mock_metric_request_total
# TYPE mock_metric_request_total counter
mock_metric_request_total{app="prometheus-mock-metrics-server"} 0
```



## Step 2: Add Prometheus receiver to your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

Next, we will set up the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive metrics from the Prometheus Metrics Server Simulator and forward them to Sumo Logic. The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic agent that can collect, process, and export telemetry data to various backends. It supports various protocols, including Prometheus. Using our [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), you can easily connect OpenTelemetry to Sumo Logic using the built-in `sumologic` exporter.

First, you need to [install the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/).

Next, create a new configuration file for the OpenTelemetry Collector with the following content:

```yml title="/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/prom.yaml"
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'mock-metrics'
          scrape_interval: 10s
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8080']
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [sumologic]
```

In the above configuration, we define a `prometheus` receiver that scrapes metrics from the Prometheus Metrics Server Simulator running on `localhost:8080`. We then define a metrics pipeline that uses the `prometheus` receiver to scrape the metrics and send them to Sumo Logic via the `sumologic` exporter.

Save the configuration file as `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/prom.yaml`.

Finally, start the OpenTelemetry Collector with the following command:

```bash
sudo otelcol-sumo \
--config=/etc/otelcol-sumo/sumologic.yaml \
--config "glob:/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/*.yaml"
```

This will start the collector with the configuration you defined, and it should start receiving and exporting metrics to Sumo Logic.


## Step 3: Create a New Dashboard in Sumo Logic

Finally, we will create a new dashboard in Sumo Logic to visualize the custom Prometheus-formatted metrics we are receiving.

To create a new dashboard:

1. Go to the Sumo Logic **Home** tab, click **+ New**, then select **Dashboard (New)** from the dropdown list.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/dashboard-new-new.png')} alt="dashboard-new-new.png" width="500"/>
1. Click the name of the dashboard and write in a unique title. In this case, we'll do **Custom Metrics Dashboard**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/custom-dashboard.png')} alt="custom-dashboard.png" width="350"/>
1. Click the **Time Series** button to create a time series chart panel.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/time-series.png')} alt="time-series.png" width="350"/>
1. Select the icon next to the query box to choose a **Metrics** query.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/custom-metrics.png')} alt="custom-metrics.png" width="400"/>
1. Select **mock_metric_counter_0** from the drop down (of course, this could be any metric. This is just an example).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/mock-counter.png')} alt="mock-counter.png" width="600" />
1. From filters, choose the **client_addr** dimension. This will let us only show the metrics for specific client(s).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/client-addr.png')} alt="client-addr.png" width="600" />
1. Choose the `=()` *In* operator. This will let us specify a list of clients we want to include on the chart.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/client-addr-0.png')} alt="client-addr-0.png" width="500"/>
1. Select the desired clients. In this case, there’s only a single client, **client3**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/client3.png')} alt="client3.png" width="400" />
1. Click the search button (magifying glass) to execute the search and see example output.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/client3-search.png')} alt="client3-search.png" />
1. You should see something like this below. If it looks right, click the **Add to Dashboard** button.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/add-to-dash.png')} alt="add-to-dash.png" />
1. Now we have a new dashboard in our Library called **Custom Metrics Dashboard** with the time-series chart showing just the clients we want to observe.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/create-dashboard-new/custom-dash-final.png')} alt="custom-dash-final.png" />  


## Step 4: Set up an alert

Now we set up an alert so that we get email when a particular metric (e.g., room temperature) exceeds a threshold and stays above that value for (2 cycles or 10 minutes, not sure which is doable).

Steps here...
