The Linux source template generates an OpenTelemetry configuration that can be pushed to a remotely managed OpenTelemetry collector (abbreviated as otelcol). By creating this source template and pushing the configuration to the appropriate OpenTelemetry agent, you can ensure the collection of Linux logs and host metrics for Sumo Logic.
		
## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for Linux

If not already present, the following [Fields](/docs/manage/fields/) are created as part of source template creation.

- **`sumo.datasource`**. Fixed value of **linux**.
- **`deployment.environment`**. This is a user-configured field set at the time of collector installation. It identifies the environment where the Linux system resides, such as `dev`, `prod`, or `qa`.
- **`host.group`**. This is a collector-level field that is user-configured at the time of collector installation. It identifies the Linux host group.
- **`host.name`**. This is tagged through the resourcedetection processor. It holds the value of the host name where the OTel collector is installed.
		
## Prerequisites
		
### For logs collection
This app is based on the following log files from the Ubuntu Linux machine.

- auth.log
- syslog
- daemon.log
- dpkg.log
- kern.log
- CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat
- audit/audit.log
- secure
- messages
- yum.log

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

## Source template configuration
		
Follow the below steps to set a remotely managed OpenTelemetry collector and push the source template to it.
		
### Step 1: Set up remotely managed OpenTelemetry collector
		
import CollectorInstallation from '../../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/collector-installation.md';
		
<CollectorInstallation/>
		
### Step 2: Configure the source template
		
In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Linux Collection. Below are the inputs required for configuration:
		
		
- **Name**. Name of the source template.
- **Description**. Description for the source template.

#### Logs Collection
- **Fields/Metadata**. You can provide any customer fields to be tagged with the data collected. By default, sumo tags `_sourceCategory` with the value otel/linux.
- **Logs**. The following fields are pre-populated with default paths, for common log files that are used in different Linux distributions. Not all paths might be relevant for your operating system. Modify the list of files as required or leave the default values.

#### Metrics Collection
- **Metrics**. Select the metric scrappers you want to enable. By default, metric collection for CPU, memory, disk, load, file system, network, and paging are enabled and process metric collection is disabled.

##### Enable process metric collection (Optional)

import ProcMetrics from '../../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/process-metric-collection.md';

<ProcMetrics/>
		
- **Scan Interval**. The frequency at which the source is scanned.
- **Processing Rules**. You can add processing rules for logs/metrics collected. To learn more, refer to [Processing Rules](../processing-rules/index.md).

### Step 3: Push the source template to the desired remotely managed collectors

import DataConfiguration from '../../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/data-configuration.md';
