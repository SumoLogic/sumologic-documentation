A mask rule is a processing rule that hides irrelevant or sensitive information from logs before they are ingested. When you create a mask rule, the selected expression will be replaced with a mask string before the data is sent to Sumo Logic. You can either specify a custom mask string or use the default `"#####"`.

Ingestion volume is calculated after applying the mask filter. If the mask reduces the size of the log, the smaller size will be measured against ingestion limits. Masking is an effective method to reduce overall ingestion volume.

## Examples

### Mask an email address

For example, to mask the email address `dan@demo.com` from this log:

`2018-05-16 09:43:39,607 -0700 DEBUG [hostId=prod-cass-raw-8] [module=RAW] [logger=scala.raw.InboundRawProtocolHandler] [auth=User:dan@demo.com] [remote_ip=98.248.40.103] [web_session=19zefhqy...] [session=80F1BD83AEBDF4FB] [customer=0000000000000005] [call=InboundRawProtocol.getMessages]`

You could use the following filter expression:

```
auth=User:.*\.com
```

Using the masking string `auth=User:AAA` would produce the following result:

`2018-05-16 09:43:39,607 -0700 DEBUG [hostId=prod-cass-raw-8] [module=RAW] [logger=scala.raw.InboundRawProtocolHandler] [auth=User:AAA] [remote_ip=98.248.40.103] [web_session=19zefhqy...] [session=80F1BD83AEBDF4FB] [customer=0000000000000005] [call=InboundRawProtocol.getMessages]`


:::important
Any masking expression should be tested and verified with a sample source file before applying it to your production logs.

### Mask credit card numbers

You can mask credit card numbers from log messages using a regular expression within a mask rule. Once masked with a known string, you can then perform a search for that string within your logs to detect if credit card numbers may be leaking into your log files.

To mask credit card numbers in logs, you can use a masking filter with the following regular expression:

The following regular expression can be used within a masking filter to mask American Express, Visa (16 digit only), Mastercard, and Discover credit card numbers:

```
((?:(?:4\d{3})|(?:5[1-5]\d{2})|6(?:011|5[0-9]{2}))(?:-?|\040?)(?:\d{4}(?:-?|\040?)){3}|(?:3[4,7]\d{2})(?:-?|\040?)\d{6}(?:-?|\040?)\d{5})
```

This regular expression covers instances where the number includes dashes, spaces, or is a solid string of numbers.

Samples include:

* **American Express**. 3711-078176-01234  \|  371107817601234  \|  3711 078176 01234
* **Visa**. 4123-5123-6123-7123  \|  4123512361237123  \|  4123 5123 6123 7123
* **Master Card**. 5123-4123-6123-7123  \|  5123412361237123  \|  5123 4123 6123 7123
* **Discover**. 6011-0009-9013-9424  \|  6500000000000002  \|  6011 0009 9013 9424


## Rules and limitations

* Expressions that you want masked must be selected by the regular expression you given. And the masking string provided will mask whole of the string which is selected by the regular expression.

    For example, for this log message:

    `{
      "reqHdr":{
        "auth":"Basic ksoe9wudkej2lfj*jshd6sl.cmei=",
        "cookie":"$Version=0; JSESSIONID=6C1BR5DAB897346B70FD2CA7SD4639.localhost_bc; $Path=/"
      }
    }`

    You would use the following as a mask expression to mask the auth parameter's token:

    ```
    "auth"\s*:\s*"Basic\s*[^"]+"
    ```

    Applying the masking string `"auth":"#####"`, the log output will be:

    `{
      "reqHdr": {
        "auth":"#####",
        "cookie":"$Version=0; JSESSIONID=6C1BR5DAB897346B70FD2CA7SD4639.localhost_bc; $Path=/"
      }
    }`

* Do not unnecessarily match on more of the log than needed. As seen in the previous example, avoid using overly broad expressions that could mask the entire log. This ensures that only the sensitive information is masked, not the whole log entry.

    ```
    (?s).*auth"\s*:\s*"Basic\s*([^"]+)".*(?s)
    ```

* Avoid regular expressions that match an entire log line, as this will result in the entire line being masked.

* To mask values spanning multiple lines, use the single-line modifier `(?s)`. For example:

    ```
    auth=User\:(.*(?s).*session=.*?)\]
    ```

:::note
- Masking utilizes the [replace_pattern](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/ottl/ottlfuncs/README.md#replace_pattern) OTTL function. In this function:
   - Escape `$` as `$$` to bypass environment variable substitution logic.
   - Use `$$$` to include a literal `$`.
- When masking strings containing special characters like double quotes (`"`) and backslashes (`\`), these characters will be escaped by a backslash when masking the logs.
