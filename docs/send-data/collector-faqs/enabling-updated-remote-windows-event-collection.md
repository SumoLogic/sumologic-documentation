title: Enabling updated Remote Windows Event Collection with 19.155 Collector
---

The 19.155 release of the Sumo Logic collector introduces a new collection approach for Remote Windows Event sources.  The new approach provides increased collection throughput, lower resource consumption, and easier configuration.

However, [system configuration requirements for the new implementation](../sources/installed-collectors/preconfigure-machine-collect-remote-windows-events.md) differ from those of earlier collector versions. For the sake of compatibility, the new implementation is left as "opt-in" for version 19.155. This topic describes how to enable this new capability.

## Enabling updated remote event collection

Take the following steps to opt-in to the updated Remote Windows Event source:

1. Stop the Sumo Logic collector service  

    ```bash
    net stop sumo-collector
    ```

1. Modify the text file "collector.properties", located in the "config" subdirectory of the Sumo Logic collector installation directory. Add the following line, and save:

    ```
    windows.remote.jni = true
    ```

1. Start the Sumo Logic collector service:

    ```
    net start sumo-collector
    ```

You can revert back to legacy WMI-based event collection at any time by removing this line from "collector.properties" (or setting the value to "false"), and restarting the collector service.
