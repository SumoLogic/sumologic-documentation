Sumo Logic uses Quartz CRON expressions. The syntax for a Quartz
CRON expression is:

```bash
<seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day of the month> <month> <day of the week> <year>
```

where is `<year>` optional.

For more information on how to specify a CRON expression, see [CRON Reference](#cron-reference). For example expressions, see [CRON Examples](#cron-examples).

:::tip
Use a [CRON Expression Generator](https://www.freeformatter.com/cron-expression-generator-quartz.html) to generate a Quartz CRON expression with an easy to use online interface.

## CRON Reference 

Cron expressions are comprised of six required fields (seconds, minutes, hours, day of the month, month, day of the week) and one optional field (year) separated by white space:

| Field Name |  Allowed Values | Allowed Special Characters |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|:--------------------------------|
| Seconds         | 0-59               | \- \* /                        |
| Minutes         | 0-59               | \- \* /                        |
| Hours           | 0-23               | \- \* /                        |
| Day (of month)  | 1-31               | \* ? / L W                     |
| Month           | 1-12 or JAN-DEC    | \- \* /                        |
| Day (of week)   | 1-7 or SUN-SAT     | \- \* ? / L #                  |
| Year (optional) | empty              | \- \* /                        |

There are several special characters that are used to specify values:

| Character |  Specifies | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| \* | All values. | `*` in the minute field means every minute. |
| ? | No specific value in the day of month and day of week fields. | `?` specifies a value in one field, but not the other. |
| - | A range. | `10-12` in the hour field means the script will run at 10, 11, and 12 (noon). |
| , | Additional values. | Typing "MON,WED,FRI" in the day-of-week field means the script will run only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. |
| / | Increments. | `0/15` in the seconds field means the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45. `*` before the '/' is equivalent to specifying 0 is the value to start with. Essentially, for each field in the expression, there is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off. For seconds and minutes, the numbers range from 0 to 51. |
| # | Day of a month. | `6#3` in the day of week field means the third Friday (day 6 is Friday; #3 is the 3rd Friday in the month). If you specify, say` #5`, and there isn't a 5th occurrence of the given day, the CRON job won't fire. If `#` is used, there can only be one expression in the day of week field. |
| L | The last day of a month or week. | `L` means the last day of the month. If used in the day of week field by itself, it means` 7` or `SAT`. If used in the day of week field after another value, it means the last \[day\] of the month; for example` 6L` means the last Friday of the month. You can also specify an offset from the last day of the month; `L-3` means the third to last day of the month. Make sure not to use `L` to specify lists or ranges of values. |
| W | The weekday (Mon-Fri) nearest the specified day. | Specifying `15W` means the CRON job will fire on the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month. If the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger fires on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger fires on Monday the 16th. W can only be specified when the day of month is a single day (not a range or list of days). |

### CRON Examples

These are examples of CRON expressions.

* A run frequency of 12:00 PM (noon) every day: `0 0 12 * * ?`
* A run frequency of 11:00 PM every weekday night: `0 0 23 ? * MON-FRI`
* A run frequency of 10:15 AM every day:` 0 15 10 * * ?`
* A run frequency of 10:15 AM every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday: `0 15 10 ? * MON-FRI`
* A run frequency of 12:00 PM (noon) every first day of the month: `0 0 12 1 1/1 ? *`
* A run frequency of every hour between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM Monday-Friday: `0 0 8-17 ? * MON-FRI`
