description: Sumo Logic offers a comprehensive Kubernetes Solution, however, if you only want to know how to set up collection you can follow our deployment guide referenced in this document.

The [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/tree/main/deploy#deployment-guide) in our sumologic-kubernetes-collection GitHub repository has detailed instructions on how to collect Kubernetes logs, metrics, and events; enrich them with deployment, pod, and service level metadata; and send them to Sumo Logic.

This guide is the same used for setting up collection for our [comprehensive Kubernetes solution](/docs/observability/kubernetes).
