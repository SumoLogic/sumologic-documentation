title: Building the Source JSON Configuration File
description: Don't start from scratch. Use these steps to build the Source JSON configuration file.

When you need to create a JSON file to configure your Collectors or Sources, the best practice is to use the UI to create your first Collector and Source with your specific parameters that suit your needs, and then use these JSON files as templates to build all other Collectors and Sources. See [View or Download Source JSON Configuration](/docs/send-data/use-json-configure-sources/local-configuration-file-management/view-download-source-json-configuration.md) for details.

:::important
JSON files need to be UTF-8 encoded following [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

For more information about configuring sources in JSON files, and how to configure Sumo to read the JSON files, see [Local Configuration File Management](/docs/send-data/use-json-configure-sources/local-configuration-file-management).
