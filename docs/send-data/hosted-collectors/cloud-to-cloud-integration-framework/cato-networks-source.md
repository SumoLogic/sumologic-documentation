Cato Networks is a cloud-native, global SD-WAN provider that delivers a secure, optimized, and agile global network for businesses of all sizes. Cato's cloud-based platform converges multiple network and security functions into a unified solution that includes SD-WAN, network security, cloud security, and secure access service edge (SASE) capabilities.

This source ingests Security and Audit events from Cato API.

## Data Sources

Cato Networks source ingests security events from [EventsFeed API](https://support.catonetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019839477-Cato-API-EventsFeed-Large-Scale-Event-Monitoring) and audit events from [AuditFeed API](https://support.catonetworks.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017900857-Cato-API-AuditFeed).

## Prerequisites

- In the Cato Management Application, only account administrators with the **Editor** privilege can generate keys. (CMA).
- To ingest security events, you must enable the events feeds on your account. To enable the events feed, follow the steps below:
    1. In the navigation panel, select **System > API Access Management**.
    1. Select **Event Feed Enabled**. After this, your account starts sending events to the Cato API server. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-networks-enable-events-feed.png')} alt="cato-networks-enable-events-feed.png" width="700" />

## Setup and Configuration

In this configuration, you will set up the Cato Networks API Key and Account ID parameter to access the Cato networks API.

### API Key

All access to Cato networks require an API Key. Follow the below instructions to set up an API Key.

1. In the navigation menu, click **Administration > API Management**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-networks-administration.png')} alt="cato-networks-administration.png" width="700" />
1. On the **API Keys** tab, click **New**. The **Create API Key** panel opens. 
1. Enter a **Key Name**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-networks-new-api-key.png')} alt="cato-networks-new-api-key.png" width="250" />
1. Select **View** in the **API Permission**.
1. Select **Any IP** to allow this API key for any IP address under the **Allow Access from IPs** section.
1. (Optional) Select a date when the API key expires. If you select an expiration date, then you need to update the source configuration with a new API key, or else an unauthorized error will be received.
1. Click **Apply**. The API key is added, and a pop-up window containing the new API key is displayed.
1. Copy the API Key generated by the Cato Management Application and save it in a secure location.
:::note
The API key value will not be available after closing this window. Kindly ensure that you copy and securely save the API key before closing the window.
:::
1. Click **OK** to close the pop-up window.

### Account ID

All API calls require an account ID parameter. When logged into the Cato account, look for a four-digit integer in the URL and take note of the account ID. . <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-networks-account-id.png')} alt="cato-networks-account-id.png" width="700" />

## States

The Cato Networks integration Source is a device security platform that discover devices, tracks behavior, detects threats, and takes action to protect your business.
When you create an Cato Networks Source, it goes through the following stages:
1. **Pending**. Once the Source is submitted, it is validated, stored, and placed in a **Pending** state.
1. **Started**. A collection task is created on the Hosted Collector.
1. **Initialized**. The task configuration is complete in Sumo Logic.
1. **Authenticated**. The Source successfully authenticated with Cato Networks.
1. **Collecting**. The Source is actively collecting data from Cato Networks.

If the Source has any issues during any one of these states, it is placed in an **Error** state.

When you delete the Source, it is placed in a **Stopping** state. When it has successfully stopped, it is deleted from your Hosted Collector.
On the [Collection page](/docs/manage/health-events#collection-page), the Health and Status for Sources is displayed. You can click the text in the Health column, such as **Error**, to open the issue in Health Events to investigate.

## Setup Cato Networks Source

When you create an Cato Networks Source, you add it to a Hosted Collector. Before creating the Source, identify the Hosted Collector you want to use or create a new Hosted Collector. For instructions, see [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).

To configure a Cato Networks Source:
1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**. 
1. On the Collection page, click **Add Source** next to a Hosted Collector.
1. Search for and select **Cato Networks**.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-logo.png')} alt="cato-logo" width="80" />
1. Enter a **Name** for the Source. The description is optional. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cato-config-main.png')} alt="cato-config-main.png" width="400" />
1. (Optional) For **Source Category**, enter any string to tag the output collected from the Source. Category metadata is stored in a searchable field called `_sourceCategory`.
1. (Optional) **Fields**. Click the **+Add** button to define the fields you want to associate. Each field needs a name (key) and value.
   * ![green check circle.png](/img/reuse/green-check-circle.png) A green circle with a check mark is shown when the field exists in the Fields table schema.
   * ![orange exclamation point.png](/img/reuse/orange-exclamation-point.png) An orange triangle with an exclamation point is shown when the field doesn't exist in the Fields table schema. In this case, an option to automatically add the nonexistent fields to the Fields table schema is provided. If a field is sent to Sumo Logic that does not exist in the Fields schema it is ignored, known as dropped.
1. Enter the **API Key** for Cato Networks account.
1. Enter the **Account ID** for Cato Networks account.
1. Select the **Data Types**. You can select one or both of the data sources.
   - If **All** is selected, the integration will fetch both security and audit events. By default, **All ** will be selected.
   - If **Security Events** is selected, the integration will fetch security data.
   - If **Audit Events** is selected, the integration will fetch audit data.
    :::note
    Data from the source will be fetched every 5 minutes.
    :::

### Error Types

When Sumo Logic detects an issue it is tracked by Health Events. The following table shows the three possible error types, the reason for the error, if the source attempts to retry, and the name of the event log in the Health Event Index.

| Type | Reason | Retries | Retry Behavior | Health Event Name |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ThirdPartyConfig  | Normally due to an invalid configuration. You'll need to review your Source configuration and make an update. | No retries are attempted until the Source is updated. | Not applicable | ThirdPartyConfigError  |
| ThirdPartyGeneric | Normally due to an error communicating with the third-party service APIs. | Yes | The Source will retry indefinitely. | ThirdPartyGenericError |
| FirstPartyGeneric | Normally due to an error communicating with the internal Sumo Logic APIs. | Yes | The Source will retry indefinitely. | FirstPartyGenericError |

### Restarting your Source
