The Sumo Logic Kickstart Data source ingests logs and metrics into Sumo Logic for our pre-loaded [OpenTelemetry Demo Astronomy application](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/kickstart-data), an e-commerce-style app that simulates real user interactions and system performance. It provides a continuous stream of data that highlights latency spikes across various services, enabling hands-on exploration of Sumo Logic features.

:::info
