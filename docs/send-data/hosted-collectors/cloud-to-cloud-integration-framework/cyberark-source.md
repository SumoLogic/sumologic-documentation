The CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) is a security solution that helps organizations reduce the risk of information theft or ransomware attacks by enforcing the principle of least privilege and preventing unauthorized access to critical systems and data. The solution employs a combination of privilege security, application control, and credential theft prevention to reduce the likelihood of malware infections.

The integration with CyberArk EPM's API allows for retrieving administrative, detailed raw, policy audit, and policy audit raw events from every set in the environment. The [API documentation](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/EPM/Latest/en/Content/LandingPages/LPDeveloper.htm) provides guidance on accessing and utilizing this information. This integration facilitates retrieving various audit events, including administrative actions, policy violations, and application usage, to generate alerts, reports, and remediation actions that enhance the organization's security posture.

## Data Sources

The CyberArk EPM ingests sets, admin audit events, detailed raw events, aggregated policy audit events, and policy audit raw events from the CyberArk API and sends data to Sumo Logic.
* **[Sets](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetSetsList.htm)**. CyberArk EPM organizes systems into logical groups based on shared attributes such as operating system type or location.
* **[Admin Audit Events](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetAdminAuditData.htm)**. CyberArk EPM captures events generated by users performing actions via the EPM console or remotely through API after logging in.
* **[Detailed Raw Events](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetDetailedRawEvents.htm)**. CyberArk EPM gathers detailed raw events from endpoints and other sources in the environment.
* **[Aggregated Policy Audit Events](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetAggregatedPolicyAudits.htm)**. CyberArk EPM logs events created by policies enforced on applications running on endpoint computers.
* **[Policy Audit Raw Events](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetPolicyAuditRawEventDetails.htm)**. CyberArk EPM gathers raw details of each Policy Audit Event.

These components enable organizations to effectively monitor and manage endpoint security, identify potential risks and vulnerabilities, and take proactive measures to safeguard their critical assets. By leveraging insights from these events, organizations can enhance their overall security posture and better protect against cyber threats.

## Metadata Fields

Metadata fields will be set, if the integration is configured with the SIEM forward option. See **Metadata Fields** table below:

| Fields     |    Value                    |
| :-------    |  :------------------------: |
|`_siemVendor`	| Cyber-Ark
|`_siemProduct` |	EPM |
| `_siemFormat`	| JSON |
| `_parser`     |	/Parsers/System/Cyber-Ark/CyberArk EPM JSON |


## States

An CyberArk Source lets you pull audit logs from the CyberArk APIs. When you create an CyberArk C2C Source, it goes through the following states:
1. **Pending**. Once the Source is submitted, it is validated, stored, and placed in a **Pending** state.
1. **Started**. A collection task is created on the Hosted Collector.
1. **Initialized**. The task configuration is complete in Sumo Logic.
1. **Authenticated**. The Source is successfully authenticated with the CyberArk APIs.
1. **Collecting**. The Source is actively collecting data from the CyberArk APIs.

If the Source has any issues during any one of these states, it is placed in an **Error** state.

When you delete the Source, it is placed in a **Stopping** state. When it has successfully stopped, it is deleted from your Hosted Collector.
On the [Collection page](/docs/manage/health-events#collection-page), the Health and Status for Sources is displayed. Use [Health Events](/docs/manage/health-events.md) to investigate issues with collection.

Hover your mouse over the status icon to view a tooltip with a count of the detected errors and warnings. You can click on the status icon to open a Health Events panel with details on each detected issue.

## Setup and Configuration

In this configuration, you will set up a CyberArk EPM source account and configure it to be authorized and authenticated to use CyberArk API. CyberArk EPM supports EPM Authentication. It authenticates a user to EPM using the username and password and returns a token and EPM server URL.
To set up a CyberArk account, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to [CyberArk](https://login.epm.cyberark.com/login) application.
1. Enter the **Username** and **Password** of your choice. You can enter any combination of letters, numbers, or special characters for both the username and password. There are no limitations on the length or complexity of the username and password either. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/login-cyberark.png')} alt="login-cyberark.png" width="600" />

## Create a CyberArk EPM Source​

When you create a CyberArk EPM Source, you add it to a Hosted Collector. Before creating the Source, identify the Hosted Collector you want to use or create a new Hosted Collector. For instructions, see [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector.md).

To configure a CyberArk EPM Source, follow the steps below:
1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**.
1. On the **Collectors** page, click **Add Source** next to a Hosted Collector.
1. Select **CyberArk EPM**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cyberark-icon.png')} alt="cyberark-icon.png" width="100"/>
1. **Name**. Enter a name to display for the Source in the Sumo Logic web application.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/cyberark-source.png')} alt="cyberark-source.png" width="400"/>
1. **Description**. (Optional)
1. **Source Category**. Enter any string to tag the output collected from the Source. Category metadata is stored in a searchable field called `_sourceCategory`.
1. **Forward to SIEM**. Check the checkbox to forward your data to Cloud SIEM. When configured with the Forward to SIEM option the following metadata fields are set:
   * `_siemVendor`—Cyber-Ark
   * `_siemProduct`—EPM
   * `_siemFormat`—JSON
   * `_parser`—/Parsers/System/Cyber-Ark/CyberArk EPM JSON
1. Fields. (Optional) Click **+Add** to ad additional fields; each field needs a name (key) and value.
   * ![green check circle.png](/img/reuse/green-check-circle.png) A green circle with a check mark is shown when the field exists and is enabled in the Fields table schema.
   * ![orange exclamation point.png](/img/reuse/orange-exclamation-point.png) An orange triangle with an exclamation point is shown when the field doesn't exist, or is disabled, in the Fields table schema. In this case, an option to automatically add or enable the nonexistent fields to the Fields table schema is provided. If a field is sent to Sumo that does not exist in the Fields schema or is disabled it is ignored, known as dropped.
1. **EPM Username**. Enter your EPM username from the [Setup and Configuration](#setup-and-configuration) section.
1. **EPM User Password**. Enter your EPM password from the [Setup and Configuration](#setup-and-configuration) section.
1. **CyberArk EPM Dispatch Server**. Enter your CyberArk EPM Dispatch Server URL, it is the dispatch server for your region. Following are some examples of dispatch server URLs:
    * For the US datacenter, the dispatch server URL is `https://login.epm.cyberark.com`.
    * For the EU datacenter, the dispatch server URL is `https://eu.epm.cyberark.com`.
1. **Application ID**. An application ID is a unique identifier that helps an API recognize which application or program is accessing it. It's like a name tag that allows the API to keep track of different applications using it. For example, *sumologic*.
1. **Adjust Rate Limit for Admin Audit Events**. This option allows to customize the number of requests the CyberArk C2C source can make to [AdminAudit](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/GetAdminAuditData.htm) endpoint.

## Error Types

When Sumo Logic detects an issue it is tracked by Health Events. The following table shows the three possible error types, the reason the error would occur, if the Source attempts to retry, and the name of the event log in the Health Event Index.

| Type | Reason | Retries | Retry Behavior | Health Event Name |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ThirdPartyConfig  | Normally due to an invalid configuration. You'll need to review your Source configuration and make an update. | No retries are attempted until the Source is updated. | Not applicable | ThirdPartyConfigError  |
| ThirdPartyGeneric | Normally due to an error communicating with the third party service APIs. | Yes | The Source will retry indefinitely. | ThirdPartyGenericError |
| FirstPartyGeneric | Normally due to an error communicating with the internal Sumo Logic APIs. | Yes | The Source will retry indefinitely. | FirstPartyGenericError |

## API Limitations

* **Session Timeout**. The session timeout for all APIs is part of the session token and is defined by the Timeout for inactive session Server Configuration parameter.

* **Adjust Request Limitations**. The CyberArk C2C source has default restrictions on the number of requests to the CyberArk EPM Server, as explained in the [CyberArk API Limitations](https://docs.cyberark.com/EPM/Latest/en/Content/WebServices/WebServicesIntro.htm#APIlimitations) documentation. However, if your server has its custom limit for requests per second(s), you can use the provided options when configuring the source.

:::note
When setting the poll frequency, it's recommended to consider these limitations and set the frequency to a reasonable value to ensure that the C2C operates efficiently without overwhelming the server.
