With a **Hosted Collector**, Sumo Logic hosts the Collector and its Sources on our end (in AWS). No need to install it on a local system in your deployment. You can create Sources to collect data from a variety of services. A single Hosted Collector can be configured with any number of Sources.

Data collection flow for S3 buckets and HTTP requests:<br/>![team built hosted diagram.png](/img/send-data/team-built-hosted-diagram.png)

Just as Installed Collectors, you can monitor the activity of Hosted Collectors using the Status tab.

:::note
The maximum number of Collectors allowed per organization isÂ 10,000.
