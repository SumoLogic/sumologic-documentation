#### Content Administrator Library

The **Content Administrator** library is available to Administrator roles only. To browse this content, go to **Library** > click **Open Library page** > click the **View as** dropdown > click **Content Administrator**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/library-content-admin.gif')} alt="library-content-admin.gif" width="800"/>

### Preferences

You can manage your personal account settings from the **Preferences** page. These settings apply only to your account. Changes you make to your preferences take effect the next time you sign in, not during the current session.

To manage your personal Sumo account preferences:

1. From the top nav bar, click the person icon, and then from the dropdown, select **Preferences**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/acct-pref.png')} alt="Account Preferences" width="300"/>
1. In the Preferences page, you can modify the following settings:
    * **My Profile**. Username and password.
    * **My Access Keys**. Add, edit, and remove access keys.
    * **My Preferences**. Your account session settings.

For more information, see [Account Preferences and Credentials](account-settings-preferences.md).

## Customize your environment with tabs

To enhance multitasking, you can now keep multiple tab open simultaneously (for example: log search, dashboards, App Catalog, and Preferences) using your web browser's tab grouping functionality. By adding Sumo Logic tabs to a tab group, any new tabs opened within the Sumo Logic platform will automatically open in the same tab group.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/tabs.png')} alt="tabs.png" width="500" />

This also allows you to collapse the tab group to reclaim valuable real estate in your browser's tab bar.

### Add dashboards and searches to your Favorites

You can create a list of favorite dashboards and log searches that appear in the left-side nav panel. Your [**Favorites** list](#accessdashboards-and-searches) makes it easy to access your most frequently used dashboards and searches.

To add a dashboard to your Favorites:
1. Open any dashboard.
1. Click the three-dot kebab icon at the top right of the menu bar, then select **Favorite** from the dropdown list. <br/> ![WTS_UI_Add-dashboard-to-Favorites.png](/img/get-started/WTS_UI_Add-dashboard-to-Favorites.png)

To add a log search to your Favorites:
1. [Save the search](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/save-search) (if not already saved) by clicking **Save As**. Then in the Save Item dialog enter a name, description, and select a folder in which to save the search.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click the three-dot kebab icon and select **Favorite** from the dropdown list. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/favorite-saved-search.png')} alt="favorite-saved-search.png" width="200"/>

### Share a dashboard, search, or folder

You can share dashboards, searches, and folders with users and roles. You can edit the sharing permissions at any time and share or revoke permissions as needed. You can share content from the following locations:

* **Left-side nav panel**. Recommended when you are familiar with the content and need to quickly share with another user.
* **Library**. Recommended when you need a detailed view of the content, who created it, and when it was last modified.

For walkthrough instructions, go to the [Share Content](/docs/manage/content-sharing) page. 

### View content that is shared with you

To see dashboards, searches, and folders that have been shared with you, do the following:

1. From the left-side nav, click **Recent**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/recent.png')} alt="recent.png" width="400"/>
1. Toggle between **Recently Opened By Me** or **Recently Shared With Me**.<br/> ![Dash3.png](/img/get-started/Dash3.png)

### Pin and manage searches

After you start a log search, you can “pin” it, and it will run in the background for up to 24 hours. If the search does not finish in that time frame, it is paused. You can restart the search at any time. Search results are available for three days.

You must start a search for the **Pin** option to appear. To pin a search, do the following:

1. Open a Search page.
1. Enter a query in the search box and click **Start**.
1. Click the three-dot icon and select **Pin** from the dropdown menu.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/pin-search.png')} alt="pin-search.png" width="200"/>
1. A message appears telling you the location of your pinned search in the **Library**. The pinned search takes the name of the Search tab by default.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/pinmessage.png')} alt="pinmessage.png" width="350"/>
1. To change the name of a pinned search, double-click the Search tab and enter a new name in the name field.

Once a search is pinned, it cannot be unpinned, but you can remove it from the **Pinned Searches** tab. You can pin up to 10 searches at a time. Queries that use the [`save` operator](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/save) cannot be pinned.

For more information, see [Pinned Searches](/docs/get-started/library/#pinned-searches).

## FAQ

This FAQ provides answers to common questions about the Sumo Logic UI redesign, which involves transitioning from the legacy Classic UI to the New UI.

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> What is being launched?</summary>

We are excited to introduce the Sumo Logic Unified Experience, internally known as Project Kanso, inspired by the Japanese principle of simplicity and clutter elimination. This initiative integrates the capabilities of our Log Analytics, Cloud SIEM, and Cloud SOAR into a unified navigation system. Alongside this integration, we have implemented several user interface enhancements to make all Sumo Logic features more accessible and user-friendly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> What issues does the New UI resolve?</summary>

The disparate user interface and varying navigation patterns among Log Analytics, Cloud SIEM, and Cloud SOAR have made it challenging for users to effectively utilize these tools together for monitoring and troubleshooting.

The current information architecture and navigation system have not effectively showcased useful functionalities to users. It's structured around tools like Traces, Log Search, and Metric Search rather than focusing on user-centric use cases. This places a burden on users to discover these functionalities.

In-app tabs present performance and usability challenges since they all operate within a single browser tab. These tabs disrupt native browser navigation features like the back button and tab grouping. The **New UI** navigation lets you leverage native browser capabilities and customize tab organization according to your preferences.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> What changes have been implemented that enhance my Sumo experience?</summary>

* **Unified Navigation**. You'll now notice a uniform navigation system across Log Analytics, Cloud SIEM, and Cloud SOAR products, ensuring a consistent experience for Sumo Logic users engaged in both observability and security use cases.
* **Improved Product Discoverability**. The left nav panel now organizes product features in a solution-centric manner, emphasizing key use cases like infrastructure monitoring, application monitoring, log analysis, security monitoring, and analytics. This reorganization aims to facilitate easier access to Sumo Logic's product features.
* **Enhanced Browsing Experience and Accelerated Performance**. In-app tabs will be replaced with native browser tabs, significantly improving _First Contentful Paint_ (FCP) and _Time to Interactive_ (TTI) metrics. With this change, you'll experience faster page load times and ability to organize tabs the way you are used to with other applications.
* **Stateful URLs**. Most of the page URLs will now be stateful, allowing you to easily share content with your team members. Any changes made in the UI will be reflected in the URL parameters, making it simple for you to copy and share URLs. Additionally, this feature enables users to navigate back to previous states effortlessly by using the browser.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> With all Sumo Logic tabs being grouped together in one browser tab, how can I prevent an excessive amount of tabs in my browser? </summary>

We understand that the removal of in-app tabs in the New UI is a significant change in our user workflow, eliciting mixed feedback. While some users appreciate the convenience of consolidated tabs within the app, others question the need for this change. Addressing performance concerns, consolidating tabs aims to reduce browser clutter, albeit potentially complicating session management. For users who prefer centralized Sumo Logic tabs, we recommend utilizing [tab grouping functionality](#customize-your-environment-withtabs) for a seamless experience.

| Classic UI | New UI |
|:---|:---|
| In-house tabs solution. Always trying to keep up with browser tab improvements. | Utilizes browser’s native tab capability like tab grouping and coloring. |
| User needs to learn new way of organizing tabs. Managing multiple Sumo instances is difficult. | User utilizes what they already know. Managing multiple Sumo instances is easier. |
| Performance degrades over long usage because user is using one browser tab. | Memory usage is distributed over different tabs. |
| Tab switches reload the tab. | Tab switches won’t reload the tab. This will accelerate time to load, which is especially useful for data-rich features like Dashboards. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> Will the New UI retain the Classic UI feature of remembering previously opened tabs from my previous session?</summary>

After analyzing tab usage data, we've found that a minimal portion of previously opened tabs are actively utilized by our users. Consequently, the Sumo Logic UI often remains cluttered with multiple unused tabs. With the introduction of the **New UI** experience, if you fail to close browser tabs from previous sessions, they will automatically reload upon login.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/tab-reload.gif')} alt="tab-reload.gif" />

Moreover, we've made the **Recents** feature more prominent in the navigation bar and plan to extend it to other content types which will make it easier for users to open recently opened tabs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> If I opt in to the New UI, will I lose access to the Classic UI?</summary>

No, opting for the **New UI** won't lock you out of the old interface. You'll have the flexibility to switch between the two experiences directly within the UI.

Once the feature flag is enabled, all organization users will see a **Switch to New UI** option in the left navigation menu. Clicking on this button allows users to opt into the **New UI**. Once opted in, the system will remember the preference, redirecting old URLs to their corresponding new ones. Consequently, subsequent logins will automatically direct users to the **New UI**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> How do I opt out of the New UI?</summary>

You have the flexibility to opt out whenever you choose. Just go to left navigation menu of the **New UI** and click the **Return to Classic UI** option. Once you've switched back to the **Classic UI**, all subsequent sessions will default to the **Classic UI** experience.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/return-to-classic.png')} alt="return-to-classic.png" width="200"/>

We highly encourage you to begin transitioning to the New UI for the latest features and updates.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q:</strong> When will Sumo Logic remove access to the Classic UI?</summary>

Our goal is to turn off access to the Classic UI in the first half of 2025. However, this timeline is subject to change and will be determined by new UI adoption rates.
