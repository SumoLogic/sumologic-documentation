## My Security Settings

You can enable 2-Step Verification and view backup codes here.

To set up 2-Step Verification, you will need to install a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) application which will automatically generate an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time.

1. Download one of the following apps:
    - For Android, iOS and Blackberry: [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)
    - For Android and iOS: [Duo Mobile](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile)
    - For Windows Phone: [Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj)
1. Scan the QR code displayed on your screen with your TOTP App.
1. After the TOTP App is configured, enter two consecutive authentication codes.

## My Access Keys

Users with a role that grants the **Create Access Keys** capability can create and manage their own Access Keys. For more information, see [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys).

## My Preferences

Preference settings are only changed for your personal account; they don't affect any other users in your organization. Any changes you make to your preferences take effect the next time you sign in, not during the current session.

### Default Timezone

If you want the Sumo Logic user interface to use your local time zone, or a time zone different from the time zone used in the timestamp of your log messages, change the setting here. This is a personal setting, and does not change the time zone for anyone else in your organization.

This option overrides the timezone set in your web browser, and affects all hours and minutes displayed in the user interface, including time ranges on the Search page, the Time column in the Messages pane, and in Dashboards. It does not affect the configurations of previously created Scheduled Searches or Real Time Alerts. For more information, see [Timestamps, Time Zones, Time Ranges, and Date Formats](/docs/send-data/reference-information/time-reference).

### Always show the timezone offset in displayed timestamps

This setting is enabled by default. To not show the timezone offset in displayed timestamps, deselect this checkbox.

### Date Format

Select from the following international date format options:
* Use the browser's default date format.
* MM/DD/YYYY (04/22/2015)
* DD/MM/YYYY (22/04/2015
* YYYY/MM/DD (2015/04/22)

:::danger
If you change the date format option, it will affect your saved searches in the Library. Any saved searches that use absolute dates for their time range must be modified to use the new date format. Scheduled searches will continue to run properly. You would need to modify the date format only if you rescheduled the search.
:::

### Web session timeout
