## What certifications do we offer?

We currently offer these certifications:

* **Fundamentals** (Formerly "Level 1: Sumo Pro User") -  Certified Users possess broad knowledge around analyzing logs and metrics and have familiarity with the Sumo Logic service related to simple data searching, filtering, parsing and analyzing. Certified users can use Apps for out-of-the-box content that monitors their data, identifies trends, and keeps their users on top of critical events.
* **Search Mastery** - Certified Users exhibit deep technical knowledge on how to analyze and correlate their logs and metrics to easily identify those critical events that are important to their organizations. In addition to taking advantage of out-of-the-box content, Certified Sumo Power Users can build Dashboards and Alerts for their custom apps, unlocking the power of Sumo Logic to analyze, measure and monitor the health of their environments.
* **Metrics Mastery** - Certified Users exhibit deep technical knowledge on how to analyze and correlate their logs and metrics to easily identify those critical events that are important to their organizations. Build on the knowledge gained in Fundamentals to do more in-depth analysis with metrics. Identify critical events with ease and create the dashboards and alerts necessary to monitor your environment.
* **Administration** - Certified users become technical experts on setting up, managing and optimizing their Sumo Logic solution. In addition to securing and managing their Sumo Logic environment, they can design and deploy a data collection strategy that fits their infrastructure. Keeping an eye on the pulse of their usage, they can also optimize data querying to fit their searching patterns.
* **Cloud Security Analytics** - In this course, you'll create starter SOC queries as dashboard panels. These advanced operator queries help you monitor user activity across the globe, failed logins, land speed violations, brute force attacks, and more. You will create parameterized lookup tables for easy panel or dashboard pivots. You will learn how to export the starter SOC dashboard you created for use in your own environment. Lastly, you will be able to detect and investigate IOCs with the use of our embedded CrowdStrike database, which monitors malicious IPs addresses, and apply scheduled views as a best practice.
* **Advanced Metrics with Kubernetes** - Certified users swiftly navigate through their Kubernetes cluster name spaces, services, nodes, and deployments. They quickly master Kubernetes for their organization with Sumo Logic from alerts and dashboards to customized templates to address key use cases.

## Do I have to take the certifications in order?

**For Partners:** technical training is available through a dedicated url: please visit [https://partnertraining.sumologic.com/](https://partnertraining.sumologic.com/) You will need an access code to register the first time. Contact your account manager for the access code.

# Training Lab Environment

## The Training Lab Environment will enable you to get hands-on practice following the lessons covered in our learning experiences. A Sumo Logic environment curated to work with the examples and lab exercises provided with our courses is available 24x7 all year round for you to practice.

## How do I access the Training Lab Environment?

* Choose a number between 001 and 999. Remember this number, since you'll use it in all your labs.
* Open a new window in a different browser. For example, if you're reading this on Chrome, open a Firefox window. Using separate browsers will keep you logged in to your regular Sumo Logic account and the training lab environment at the same time.
* Navigate to **`https://service.sumologic.com`** in the new browser window you opened in Step 2.
* Enter the credentials found at the top of the **Become a Sumo Expert** page of the **Training Portal**. Note: the password changes monthly, so you may have to check back there often.
* You'll know you have access when you see "Sumo Logic Training" when you hover over the user in the bottom left corner.
* Save your training username for use during this training. It's a good idea to have both the Sumo Logic training lab environment and this self-paced program open in separate windows, so you can toggle between them. Be careful not to take exams or self-paced courses with training account credentials!

## Where can I find the credentials to access the training lab environment to complete the hands-on activities?

Credentials change monthly, we post them on the training portal  in the **Become a Sumo Logic Expert** section
