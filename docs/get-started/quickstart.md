Sumo Logic provides extensive features and options to gather, monitor, and analyze data, manage your infrastructure, integrate with third-party applications, and so much more!

Follow this quickstart guide to connect, integrate, configure, and start using Sumo Logic for your organization. If you're new to Sumo Logic, check out the [Sumo Logic Overview](/docs/get-started/overview).

What you'll learn:
* Get your data into Sumo
* Search and analyze your data
* Monitor and troubleshoot your environment
* Share your findings with your team

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Sumo Logic account. Sign up for a free trial [here](/docs/get-started/sign-up).

## Get Started page

Welcome to Sumo! After signing up, be sure to head to **Get Started** page, your personalized onboarding hub that guides you through key actions like sending data, exploring apps, and inviting teammates.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/kickstart-welcome-landing.png')} alt="Kickstart Data and onboarding welcome page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

This dashboard will give you an instant view of key performance metrics using Kickstart sample data. You can explore how Sumo Logic monitors application health—no setup needed.

1. **Sample dashboards**. When you first log in, you'll see sample data preloaded into Sumo Logic, tailored to your monitoring and troubleshooting use cases, along with log searches and the following dashboards:
   * **Application reliability**. Metrics like Homepage Load Time, Checkout Errors, and Internal Server Orders.
   * **Business KPIs**. Revenue Trends, Promo Performance, and Customer Feedback Metrics.
   * **Security**. Security events and failed sign-in attempts across multiple geographical locations.
1. **Onboarding checklist**. You will follow a guided checklist that helps you:
    * Analyze the sample data.
    * Perform log searches.
    * Invite team members to join and explore the platform with you.
1. **Transition to real data**. Kickstart Data is available for 20 days or until you start ingesting real data—whichever comes first. It deactivates automatically at the end of the trial, but can be skipped at any time.

:::note For Admins
For configuration information, refer to [Kickstart Data app](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/kickstart-data) and [Kickstart Data source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/sumo-logic-kickstart-data-source).

### Getting started with Kickstart Data in your trial

As part of your trial, Kickstart Data gives you instant access to preloaded sample log data and dashboards—no setup, data ingestion, or firewall configuration required—so you can immediately explore the value of Sumo Logic in a safe sandbox environment. No sensitive or real data is used, and the prebuilt dashboards offer a hands-on way to learn how to monitor applications, analyze trends, and respond to incidents.

The Kickstart sample data you see in the [sample app/dashboards](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/kickstart-data) are [sourced from cloud-to-cloud data](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/sumo-logic-kickstart-data-source).

Once you're ready to work with your own data, follow the in-product prompts to begin ingesting logs via OpenTelemetry, Hosted Collectors, or Installed Collectors. The Kickstart experience will phase out automatically once you start ingesting real data or after 20 days—whichever comes first.

## Step 1: Get your data into Sumo

The journey of 10,000 logs begins with a single collector. Your data analytics journey starts by sending your data to Sumo Logic.

### Set up data collection

To set up data collection, select the platform (AWS, Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, macOS) from which you want to collect data. This will install the OpenTelemetry collector and relevant dashboards.
* For AWS, you'll deploy a single account with a CloudFormation Template, CLI, or Terraform.
* For Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, or macOS, you'll need to run the provided command in your Terminal or PowerShell.

You'll also see an option to bypass setup and explore our [App Catalog](/docs/integrations), where you'll find a wide range of apps and easy-to-follow setup guides for installation.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/data-onboarding.png')} alt="Data onboarding screen showing platform collection options like AWS, Kubernetes, Windows, macOS" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

When the installation is complete, click **Start using Sumo**.

Your data will start flowing in a couple of minutes. Next, you'll be taken to a step-by-step onboarding guide, where you can visualize your data via dashboards, run your first log search, set up alerts, install apps, and more.

### Set up Collector

:::info
OpenTelemetry is our preferred collector unless you're configuring security data ingestion.
:::

#### OpenTelemetry Collector

1. Sign in to Sumo Logic.
1. In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **App Catalog**.
1. Click the app you'd like to install.
1. Click the **Add a New Collector** option during app installation.
   :::note
   Only V2 apps have the **Add a New Collector** option.
   :::
1. After you've installed the collector, you'll be prompted with instructions to set up the source.

#### Installed and Hosted Collector

1. Sign in to Sumo Logic.
1. [**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the main Sumo Logic menu select **Data Management**, and then under **Data Collection** select **Collection**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Collection**.<br/>[**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Collection > Collection**. 
1. Select **Add Collector**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/WTS_Collector_page.png')} alt="Add Collector" />
1. Choose from our [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors) (web-hosted) or [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) (locally installed on your machine).

### Set up Source

In this step, you'll choose the data sources that will provide the most value for you.

#### OpenTelemetry Collector

See [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector).

#### Installed and Hosted Collector

1. Find your Collector in the Collection page table and select **Add** > **Add Source**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/WTS_Collection_Page.png')} alt="Add source" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Follow the prompts to set up your desired Source. For more information on configuring specific sources, see [Installed Collector Sources](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/) and [Configure a Hosted Collector Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector/#step-2-configure-a-source).

## Step 2: Search and analyze your data

Once your data is available in Sumo, you and your colleagues can search your logs and metrics to identify unusual conditions or errors that could indicate a problem. You do this by creating queries and parsing the resulting messages.

You can start a log search, metrics search, or live tail from the Sumo Home page by clicking the respective icon. For walkthrough instructions on how to create a query and parse the messages, see [About Search Basics](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/about-search-basics/).

## Step 3: Monitor and troubleshoot your environment

Not sure how to use your data to monitor and and troubleshoot your environment? Sumo Logic offers a variety of Apps with predefined queries and visualizations that help you get up and running quickly.

### App Catalog

You can **browse our library of available apps** by selecting **App Catalog**, then scrolling through the library or entering a name in the search field. For more information, see [Apps and Integrations](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/WTS_Apps-Catalog.png')} alt="App Catalog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

### Dashboards

You can **view your data with predefined searches and dashboards** that facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting. For more information, see [Get Started with Metrics](/docs/metrics/introduction/get-started-metrics/).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/WTS_View-Dashboards.png')} alt="View dashboards" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

## Step 4: Share your findings with your team

You have downloaded an app and analyzed your data with searches and dashboards. You may even have [modified your dashboards](/docs/dashboards/panels/modify-chart), and now you want to share your findings with your team. You can easily share a dashboard by clicking the share icon in the top menu bar.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/WTS_Share-dashboard.png')} alt="Share dashboard" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

You have the ability to share with individual users and groups with specific roles, setting the specific access permissions. You can edit the sharing permissions at any time, and share and revoke permissions as needed. For more information, see [Content Sharing in Sumo Logic](/docs/manage/content-sharing).
