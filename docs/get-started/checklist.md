Sumo Logic is a highly flexible and scalable solution. It provides solutions that work for any size of an organization. The collection of logs in Sumo Logic is managed by the collectors and they help in designing the best Sumo Logic deployment. There are various factors to consider when making a decision to implement a Sumo Logic solution in your organizations based on the different collection strategies.

## Basics and Account Configuration 
**Retention.** Determine the average data retention for your account (total storage / daily ingest) and change the General Index retention period if necessary. The General Index settings can be found on the Manage Data > Settings > Partitions menu, which is explained in further detail on the Optimization Setup sheet of this document.

**Data Volume Index.** Enable the data volume index. This feature allows you to track your log and metric ingest more closely using a built-in Sumo tool.

**Audit Index.** Enable the audit index. This feature allows you to track user behavior, content changes, and scheduled search execution results.

**Data Volume App.** Install the Data Volume app in Sumo App Catalog and explore the app's content. This will give you insight into your log and metric ingest volume, as well as the identification of top sources using various metadata tags.

**Audit App.** Install the Audit app and explore its content. You can use this to monitor user activity, content changes, as well as scheduled search changes and executions.

## Collection Setup 
Sumo Logic helps in transforming daily operations into intelligent business decisions. The data needs to be sent to Sumo Logic to allow users to perform their analysis. There are two types of collectors and you need to choose the Collector right for your environment using Sumo Logic.

Get to know how to choose your collector through our video "Choosing Your Collector Type".
