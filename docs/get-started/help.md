## Service Status

To view the status of the Sumo Logic service, find information on any outages, and see Scheduled Maintenance for your deployment, go to **Help** > **Service Status**. Alternatively, you can go directly to [status.sumologic.com](http://status.sumologic.com).

If there has been an outage on your [deployment](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) (or pod), the Service Status Indicator displays:

1. At the top of the **Help** menu.
1. Next to **Help** > **Service Status**.
1. Next to the title of a [Dashboard](../dashboards/about.md).

For more information, click **Help > Service Status**. This will take you to a web page for your pod with details on any outages, incidents, or planned maintenance.

The Service Status Indicator on the Help menu shows the severity of the outage.

| Icon | Status |
| :-- | :-- |
| NONE | **None.** All systems operational. |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_critical.png) | **Critical.** Major system outage. |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_major.png) | **Major.** Partial system outage.  |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_minor.png) | **Minor.** Minor system outage. |

To determine which pod your account uses, look at the Sumo Logic URL. If you see `us2`, that means you're running on the US2 pod. If you see `eu` or `au`, you're on one of those pods.
