## Sumo Logic Status and Scheduled Maintenance

To view the status of the Sumo Logic service, find information on any outages, and see Scheduled Maintenance for your deployment, go to **Help** > **Service Status**.

You can also go to http://status.sumologic.com/.

If there has been an outage on your [deployment] (../../APIs/General-API-Information/Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-by-Deployment-and-Firewall-Security.md) (or pod), the Service Status Indicator displays:

1.  At the top of the **Help** menu.
2.  Next to **Help \> Service Status**.
3.  Next to the title of a [Dashboard] (../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Dashboards/01-About-Dashboards.md).

For more information, click **Help \> Service Status**. This will take you to a web page for your pod with details on any outages, incidents, or planned maintenance.

The Service Status Indicator on the Help menu shows the severity of the outage.

| Icon | Status |
| -- | -- |
| NONE | **None.** All systems operational. |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_critical.png) | **Critical.** Major system outage. |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_major.png) | **Major.** Partial system outage.  |
| ![](/img/reuse/outage_minor.png) | **Minor.** Minor system outage. |

To determine which pod your account uses, look at the Sumo Logic URL. If you see "us2" that means you're running on the US2 pod. If you see "eu" or "au" you're on one of those pods.
