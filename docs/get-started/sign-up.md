### Set up data collection

Upon first logging in, you'll be asked to select the platform (AWS, Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, macOS) from which you want to collect data. This will install the OpenTelemetry collector and relevant dashboards.
* For AWS, you'll deploy a single account with a CloudFormation Template, CLI, or Terraform.
* For Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, or macOS, you'll need to run the provided command in your Terminal or PowerShell.

You'll also see an option to bypass setup and explore our [App Catalog](/docs/integrations), where you'll find a wide range of apps and follow easy-to-use setup guides for installation.

When the installation is complete, click **Start using Sumo**.

Your data will start flowing in a couple of minutes. Next, you'll be taken to a step-by-step onboarding guide, where you can visualize your data via dashboards, run your first log search, set up alerts, install apps, and more.

### Upgrade or continue with Free account

After your trial ends, if you've not purchased a plan, your account will automatically convert to a Free account. This account lets you continue using Sumo Logic monitoring and log analytics services with limited features. To unlock premium features and scale as your needs grow, you can upgrade to a paid plan at any time.

## Sign up through AWS Marketplace

Signing up for a Sumo Logic account through the AWS Marketplace creates a new Sumo Logic organization and account. This option is not available for customers with existing Sumo Logic accounts.

To sign up through AWS Marketplace:

1. Sign in to the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace), search for "Sumo Logic", and then click the subscription option of your choice. To sign up with an initial 30-day free trial, select **Sumo Logic Log Analytics Platform (Pay-As-You-Go with 30-day Free Trial)** highlighted below.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/aws_marketplace_new.png')} alt="AWS Marketplace" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Click **View purchase options**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/aws_marketplace_view_purchase_options.png')} alt="View purchase options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Configure your free trial contract and click **Subscribe**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/aws_marketplace_create_contract.png')} alt="Create contract" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. After the subscription finishes processing, you can set up your account.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/aws_marketplace_setup_new.png')} alt="Set up your account" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. You are redirected to Sumo Logic to complete your account creation:
    - **Email**. Enter a business email address for your account (personal email addresses such as Gmail are not supported). If you have an existing Sumo Logic account, use a different email address. Signing up through AWS Marketplace requires a new email to create a separate Sumo Logic organization.
    - **Region**. Select your region: North America, Europe, or Australia.
    - **Service License Agreement**. Review and accept the [Service License Agreement](https://www.sumologic.com/service-agreement/) to proceed.
1. Click **Sign Up**. Sumo Logic will send you an email to activate your account. Follow the instructions in the email to complete the [activation process](#activate-your-account)
1. At the end of the 30-day trial period for the Sumo Logic Log Analytics Platform (Pay-As-You-Go with 30-day Free Trial), the subscription converts to the paid subscription billed monthly based on actual usage.

### Upgrade your account

Upgrading increases your reserved capacity to avoid overage charges. If upgrades are allowed for your AWS account, you can upgrade your active account directly from Sumo Logic.

- Payment is handled by Amazon. You do not need to provide any payment information.
- Upgrading increases your reserved Sumo Logic ingest volume, reducing the risk of overage charges.
- Account upgrades are independent from your AWS subscription.

To upgrade:

1. Click **Upgrade** on the left navigation pane in Sumo Logic.
1. The **Upgrade** button is visible if you have an active AWS account for which upgrades are permitted.
1. On the upgrade request form, enter the Log Ingest level you want to upgrade to. Within 24 to 48 hours, your account will be updated to reflect the change. Once the account is upgraded, the AWS Marketplace will be notified of the change.

#### Cancelling

To cancel an auto-renewal subscription, you can do this through the AWS Marketplace under **Manage subscriptions**.

### Billing

An account that is within its limits is defined as using Reserved Capacity. After your trial, if you've signed up for auto-renewal, you will be billed for your plan’s daily ingest data volume.

Each day, you can burst over the Reserved Capacity or ingest a lower amount, and at the end of the billing cycle, Sumo Logic computes the total amount for the actual usage during this time. If your actual usage exceeds the total Reserved Capacity for the billing cycle, you will be charged for usage for this difference at the on-demand rate.

The Total Reserved Capacity (usage) is: (the actual number of days in the billing cycle) X (plan daily ingest volume).

For example, for 10GB/Day:

- If the billing cycle is 30 days, the Reserved Capacity is 300GB.
- If the billing cycle is 31 days, the Reserved Capacity is 310GB.
