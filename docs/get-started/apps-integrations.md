## Certified by Sumo Logic

Many of our apps are labeled with the **Certified by Sumo Logic** designation. Just look for the blue checkmark symbol:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/cert-app.png')} alt="cert-app.png" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

These apps have gone through code and functional review with the Sumo Logic app development team as part of the [App Intelligence Partner Program](https://www.sumologic.com/technology-partners). This process includes feedback and re-review as needed, and ensures that apps certified through this process meet the team's quality standards.

## Next-Gen apps

Our Next-Gen apps, which simplify the management and maintenance of apps, are designed to help you get started using the [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector) agent. For a limited time, you can still continue to send data through the Sumo Logic Installed Collector and Hosted Collector.

What makes Next-Gen different from Classic apps?

* Installation and updates must be performed by an administrator or a user with the **Manage Apps** role capability.
* App icons will display a badge indicating if it's been installed within your org.
* App icons will display a badge indicating if there's an app update available. The upgrade can then be applied with a single click.
* App uninstallation and removal can be completed directly in the App Catalog, making it easy to clean up apps you no longer use.  
* Additional filter options make it easy to find your installed or upgradeable apps.
* Upon app installation, content is installed into a shared **Installed Apps** folder that's visible to your entire org, making it easier to locate and upgrade, when needed.
* Installed app content is immutable, which ensure that any apps upgrades do not overwrite any customizations you may apply. If you wish to customize the content, you'll need to first make a custom copy of the content.

### How to install Next-Gen apps

import AppInstall from '../reuse/apps/app-install-v2.md';

### How to install classic apps in multiple environments

If you have multiple environments generating data that you want to monitor using Sumo Logic apps — for example, environments for production, development, and testing — you’ll need to perform the following steps in each environment:

1. Set up Sumo Logic Collectors and Sources for each environment. Make sure that Source Hosts and Source Categories are named correctly in order to clearly indicate the environment name to the apps when they are installed.
1. Perform any prerequisites required for the particular Sumo Logic app in that environment. Each Sumo Logic app has unique requirements, so make sure to follow the specific instructions for that app.
1. Install an instance of the Sumo Logic app for each environment, configure it to accept data from that environment, and rename the app to reflecting the deployed environment.

Your data comes in from each of your environments (like production, development, testing) into the corresponding installed Sumo Logic app. The environment data and its Sources are identified by Host Names and Source Categories as configured by you or your administrators.

### Installation example

In this example, a company has three environments: qa, prod, and perf. You will configure the Sumo Logic Collectors and Sources to identify each environment correctly, perform any necessary prerequisites for the Sumo Logic app, then finally install an instance of the app for each of your environments.

#### Set up Sumo Logic Collectors and Sources

Before installing any applications, define your Collectors in each environment so that Source Host metadata indicates the deployment. For example, name them something like `abc13-qa-cluster01`, `acb10-prof-cluster03`, or `abc01-prod-cluster12`.

Optionally, you can set a Source Category to indicate these names as well, depending on how Sumo Logic is architected at your company.

#### Perform any Prerequisites required for the Sumo Logic app

Each Sumo Logic app has unique requirements, so make sure to follow the specific instructions for that app. For details, see Sumo Logic apps.

#### Install an Instance of the Sumo Logic app for each Environment

1. Install an instance of the Sumo Logic app for the first environment, **qa**.
   * If you have used Source Host to identify the environment, in the **Install Application** dialog, you can configure the app with a custom data filter using `_sourceHost=qa`.
   * If you have used a Source Category to delineate the deployment, when installing the app, you could configure it using the Source Category `_sourceCategory=qa-abc`.
   * Rename the title of the app to denote the environment it is configured for, for example, **Windows-QA**.
1. Next, install an instance of the Sumo Logic app for the **prod** environment.
   * In the **Install Application** dialog, indicate the name of the environment in the Source Host, such as `_sourceHost=prod`.
   * Rename the title of the app to denote the environment it is configured for, for example, **Windows-Prod**.
1. Finally, install an instance of the Sumo Logic app for the **perf** environment.
   * In the **Install Application** dialog, indicate the name of the environment in the Source Host, such as `_sourceHost=perf`.
   * Rename the title of the app to denote the environment it is configured for, for example, **Windows-Perf**.

## Troubleshooting

If you've installed a Sumo Logic app and no data appears in its Dashboards, you may have chosen the wrong Source Category.

Apps are dependent on the Source Category [metadata](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/built-in-metadata) associated with your logs. This metadata is established when Collectors and Sources are configured. Because each organization uses their own metadata methodology check with your Sumo Logic account's Administrator to get a better idea of which Source Category would be the best fit for a given app.

#### How can I change the Source Category associated with an app?

To change the Source Category used by an app, you can simply reinstall the same app. Currently, apps cannot be uninstalled or edited in any other way.

For more information, see [Custom Data Filters](#custom-data-filters).

## Run Searches from Sumo Logic apps

Sumo Logic apps provide a host of pre-built saved searches for popular data Sources that you can run against your data without installing the app itself. This way, you can try the searches in a Sumo Logic app against your data before you decide to install it. Or you can run the searches to see how good example queries are written.

To run a saved search from a Sumo Logic app, just find the search you want to run in the Library, click it, and select a Source Category or a custom data filter to run the search against. The Search page opens and runs the search in a new tab automatically using the query's time range.

In order to run a search from an app, you would first need to have data ingested in your system that the search query would find. For example, before you can run a search from the Sumo Logic app for Apache, you must set up a Collector and Source to ingest your Apache data. If you do not have data that matches the requirements of the search query, or if you select the incorrect Source Category or data filter, you will either get no results, or bad results.

After the search has run, you can [save the search](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/save-search) to use it again in the future from the Library.

:::important
Searches from Enterprise apps, which require a paid Professional Services contract, are not included.
:::

To run a search from a Sumo Logic app:

1. Find the Sumo Logic app for the data Source you would like to search in the **App Catalog**. For example, we've picked Cloud Passage Halo's **Outlier in Critical Issues**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/library/FindSearchInApp.png')} alt="Outlier in critical issues" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="700" />
1. Find the search you want to run and click it.
1. In the **Run Search** dialog, select a **Source Category** or enter a **Custom data filter** to run the search against.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/library/RunSearch.png')} alt="Run a Search from an app" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. Click **Run Search**.

The **Search** page opens, the search populates a new tab, and the search runs using the query's time range. If you would like to use a different time range, stop the search and reset it.

If you do not have data that matches the requirements of the search query, or if you select the incorrect Source Category or data filter, you will either get no results, or bad results.

:::note
Searches included with the [Sumo Logic app for Data Volume](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/data-volume "Data Volume app") do not require you to select a Source Category.
:::

## Custom data filters

When you install a Sumo Logic app, you tell Sumo what data to search and present in app dashboards.

Most typically, you specify the source category that was assigned to the logs or metrics source when data collection was set up for the app. 

However, if you want to use multiple metadata fields as your filter criteria, for example, both source category and source host, you must define a custom data filter. The app will prefix its searches with your custom data filter. 

### Define a custom data filter

1. In the App Catalog, select the application you want to install and click **Add Integration**.
1. Click the down arrow next to **Source Category**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/library/add-apache.png')} alt="Custom Data Filter" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. A **Custom Data Filter** option appears. Click the option.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/library/apache-custom-filter.png')} alt="apache-custom-filter" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. Enter a filter expression in the **Custom Data Filter** field. For example filters, see [Example custom data filters](#example-custom-data-filters), below.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/get-started/library/apache-custom-filter-field.png')} alt="apache-custom-filter-field" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Example custom data filters

The table below has examples of custom data filters.

| Custom Data Filter | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `_sourceHost=stage-EMEA* AND _sourceCategory=Apache*` | App searches will return data whose source host begins with the string stage-EMEA and whose source category begins with the string Apache. |
| `_sourceCategory=Apache* AND "dev-us"` | App searches will return log data that contains the string dev-us whose source category begins with the string Apache. |
| `_sourceHost = "Jon Smith"` | App searches will return data whose source host is Jon Smith. If a metadata field value contains spaces, you must use quotes. |
| `_sourceHost=stage-EMEA* AND (_source=Apache* or _source=DB)` | App searches will return data whose source host begins with the string stage-EMEA and whose source either begins with Apache or is DB. We use parentheses to group the logic operations. |
