# Manage the Library

## Manage Folders to the Library

You can add folders and subfolders to the Library in order to organize your content for easy access or to share content.

In the **Library**, your **Personal** folder is the root folder for all your saved content. Any time you save a search, a dashboard, or install an app, it is automatically saved here in a flat folder structure, ordered alphabetically.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="folders"
  values={[
    {label: 'Add Folders', value: 'folders'},
    {label: 'Add Subfolders', value: 'subfolders'},
    {label: 'Move Content in Personal Folders', value: 'movefolders'},
    {label: 'Move Content into Subfolders', value: 'movesubfolders'},
    {label: 'Share Subfolders', value: 'sharesubfolders'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="folders">

To add a folder to the Library:

1. Click the **Library** icon ![library icon.png](../static/img/Library/Add-Folders-to-the-Library/../../../Assets/Media_Repo_for_Start_Here/library%20icon.png) at the top of the UI.
1. Click **New Folder**.

    ![](../static/img/Library/Add-Folders-to-the-Library/AddFolder2.png)
1. In the **Add Folder** dialog, enter a name for the new folder, and click **Add**. 

    ![](../static/img/Library/Add-Folders-to-the-Library/AddFolder.png)
1. The new folder is added to the folder list in alphabetical order.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="movefolders">

In your Personal Folder, you can move your saved content, for example, to organize searches and Dashboards into subfolders.

To move content:

1.  Select the item you want to move, click the details icon to the right of the name, and from the menu, select **Move**.
2.  In the **Move Item** dialog, select the location you want to move the content to, and click **Move**.

    ![moveDashboard.gif](../static/img/Library/Move-Content-Personal-Folder/moveDashboard.gif)

The item(s) will be moved and appear in the new location.

When your content is moved, you’ll need to click the folder where it is now located to view its contents in the list on the right.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="subfolders">

1. Create a subfolder by clicking **New Folder** in your Personal folder.

    ![](../static/img/Library/Create-Subfolders-to-Organize-and-Share-Content/AddNewFolder.png)

1. In the **Add Folder** dialog, enter **My Apps**, and click **Add**. 

    ![](../static/img/Library/Create-Subfolders-to-Organize-and-Share-Content/AddFolder.png)   The new subfolder is added to the folder list.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="movesubfolders">

Now you can organize your saved content in the new subfolders.

1. From your Personal folder, select the item you want to move. Click the details icon and select **Move**.
1. In the **Move Item** dialog, select your desired folder and click **Move**.

    ![](../static/img/Library/Create-Subfolders-to-Organize-and-Share-Content/MoveFile.png)

1. Do the same for any other Apps you have installed. They will be moved and then appear under the **My Apps** folder.
1. Now move any searches or Dashboards that deal with errors into the new **Errors** subfolder. You can tell what the list items are from their icons: a search uses a magnifying glass icon, a Dashboard uses a picture icon, and an App uses a folder icon.    

When your saved content is organized, you’ll need to click the subfolder to view its contents in the list on the right.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sharesubfolders">

If want to share the apps you have installed in order to share them with your organization, you can share your entire **MyApps** folder. This way, any app that you install in the future to this subfolder would be automatically published and shared with your team.

To publish a subfolder:

1. Select **MyApps**, click the details icon.
1. Click **Share**.
1. The **Share Folder** dialog appears. Choose **Your organization** to share with. Anyone in your org will be able to see this folder.
1. Click **Save**. The **MyApps** folder is added to the **Org** folder, in a subfolder labeled with your name. Now everyone in your organization can access your published content.

In the future, any Apps that you install in this published folder will be automatically published. If you want to create a folder hierarchy, create the desired hierarchical subfolders and publish the topmost folder. All subfolders will be published with the parent folder.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Share a Saved Search from the Library

Once you’ve saved content, you can choose to share it, which makes it available to other users. Your shared content is automatically added to the Library in the **Org \> \[Your Name\] **folder.

To share a search and its results, see [Share a Link to a Search](../../05Search/Get-Started-with-Search/Search-Basics/Share-a-Link-to-a-Search.md "Share a Link to a Search"). 

Once shared, other users in your organization can:

* Search for and find your shared search.
* Click your search to run it in the Search page.
* Copy your search to save and edit it. 
* Export the text of your search. 

Searches and Dashboards can be shared and unshared at any time. Additionally, other users can copy what you've shared and make further customizations.
