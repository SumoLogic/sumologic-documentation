# Sumo Logic Library

You can save, share, and manage Searches, Dashboards, Apps, and other Sumo Logic content in the Library. The Library also allows you to launch searches and Dashboards with a single click—speeding up access to the searches you find yourself running consistently. Additionally, you can use the content that others in your organization have already developed to continually discover new insights in your data.

Open the **Library** page to expose additional search options and to organize and manage Library contents.

To open the **Library** page, click the **Library** (folder) icon at the top of the UI. You'll see two View as options:

* **Me**: See your own saved searches and dashboards.
* **Content Administrator**: Available if you have a Sumo role that grants you "Manage Content" capability, this option turn off your personal content in the Library and allow you to see the entire Sumo file tree.  In this mode you can migrate content from one location to another, as well as highlight important content in the Admin Recommended folder. For more information, see Admin Mode.
