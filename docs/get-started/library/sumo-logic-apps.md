Sumo Logic Apps address these common use cases:

* **Increase availability and performance.** Sumo Logic enables issues to be identified before they impact the application and customer. Precise, proactive analytics quickly uncover hidden root causes across all layers of the application and infrastructure stack.
* **Provide real-time insights.** With Sumo Logic enterprises easily extract machine data insights to provide greater intelligence around their customers, products, and application usage. These insights provide a more accurate and complete analysis for business users.
* **Accelerate Cloud deployment.** Sumo Logic enables enterprises to automate and speed the development and deployment process for cloud-based applications. Companies can rapidly detect, identify and resolve application issues.
* **Decrease app time to market.** With Sumo Logic, companies can implement a consistent release process resulting in on-time releases. They can easily identify application issues and configuration changes across development, test and deployment environments.
* **Enforce compliance.** Sumo Logic delivers a simple, proactive and automated process to audit and investigate operational, security and regulatory compliance incidents. All data is centralized, secured, and easily analyzed in real-time through a single, highly scalable solution.

## Preview Apps

Preview Apps are Sumo Logic Apps that are currently under development, but are not yet released or officially supported. They appear in the Library under the **Preview** tab. You can install and use Preview Apps to test how well their use cases work for you, and provide feedback to Sumo Logic.

Preview Apps that have the highest customer adoption rate will become the first in the queue to be adopted and moved to the Apps tab, where they will be officially supported by Sumo Logic.

As Preview Apps are iterated, updated, and finally released, you will need to reinstall the App to get the latest version.

Because Preview Apps are not fully developed, they are not officially supported by Sumo Logic Support, and documentation instructions are not final. To provide feedback, report a bug, or get help, log into the [Sumo Logic Community](https://community.sumologic.com/s/topic/0TOE0000000g6auOAA/Apps), and post to the topic for your Preview App.
