We are leveling up our Sumo Logic certification program with the launch of **Sumo Logic Academy**, our new hub for training and professional development.  

With Sumo Logic Academy, you’ll find an expanded and refined course catalog, live remote exam proctoring through our partner Kryterion, and industry-recognized digital badges issued by Credly. These enhancements bring our program in line with best practices across the industry, giving you credentials you can trust and proudly share with peers, employers, and the wider professional community.

## Getting started

### How do I access the learning portal?

The learning portal is our self-paced eLearning site. It is easy to access directly from your Sumo Logic **Home** page. Just click the **Learn** tab > **Learning Hub - Start Here!**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/learning-hub.png')} alt="Open the Learning Hub from the Home page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

You will land in the learning portal (self-paced portal), where you can access complimentary, on-demand courses. You will find all certification courses and workshops in a self-paced format, built to the same standard as our instructor-led offerings, ready for you to learn anytime, anywhere, at your own pace.

### How can I join a free live class?

[On our website](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training), you can find an overview of all training resources, free live classes, micro lessons, private sessions, and more. It is a public website, not a portal, and does not require you to sign in.


## Cost and course availability

### Why are you moving from a free to a paid model?

By investing in a Sumo Logic Certified credential, you’ll gain a meaningful, industry-recognized certification that validates your real-world skills.  

Unlike our previous knowledge-based quizzes, the new exams are skills-based, proctored, and credentialed. This ensures your certification carries weight and distinction, giving you a proven advantage in your career while driving adoption of advanced use cases in your organization.

Improvements include:

* **All new exams**. Assessments now measure skills rather than basic knowledge checks. Refer to our [full catalog of certifications](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/), including, but not limited to:
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Search Mastery User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Admin*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Logs for Security Analyst*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Cloud SIEM Practitioner*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Metrics Analyst*
* **Live, remote proctoring**. Exams are administered by Kryterion with live proctors to ensure fairness and integrity.
* **Digital badges**. After passing your exam, you’ll receive a Credly-issued badge you can share on LinkedIn, your resume, and within your organization.

### Do I have to pay for training courses or just the certification?

All Sumo Logic training, including self-paced eLearning, hands-on public virtual classes, and workshops, remains free to all users. The only cost is for the certification exam itself. Private and custom training will continue to be available for purchase.

### How much does it cost to get certified?

The cost of exams is $100 for Fundamentals and $150 for advanced certifications. Payment can be made by credit card or purchase order through your Sumo Logic account representative.

### Is a voucher included in my training class?

No. Training remains free of charge, but a fee applies for certification exams.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?

Vouchers are valid for one year from the date of issue.

## Certification value and renewal

### Why should I get Sumo Logic certified?

The role-based Sumo Logic Certified program helps you grow your skills, demonstrate expertise, and earn a credential you can showcase to peers and employers. You’ll build confidence using Sumo Logic products and gain a differentiated level of knowledge to support your organization.

### If I already have Sumo Logic certifications, will I lose those?

The new credentials replace our previous certifications. Existing certifications remain valid until their original expiration (Fundamentals: two years; all others: one year). You’re welcome to renew under the new program at any time.

### Can I get re-certified?

Yes. You can renew your credential at any time by retaking the relevant exam.

### How long do certifications last?

Certifications are valid for two years before they need to be renewed. This is one year longer than our previous model.

### Are continuing education credits included with the certification?

Not at this time.

Yes. A pass/fail result will appear on the screen after submission and once you exit the secure proctored environment.

### What is the retake policy? Will I have to pay again?

You can retake your exam 48 hours after the previous attempt. Each retake requires a new voucher. For security, we do not share which specific questions were missed; only your overall score is shown.

After passing your exam, you’ll receive a digital badge issued via Credly. You can manage and share your badges through the [Credly portal](https://info.credly.com/). We also encourage you to join the [Sumo Logic Certification community on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13542036/) to network and add your badges to your profile to showcase your achievement.
