Sumo Logic is evolving our popular [certification program](/docs/get-started/training-certification-faq) to drive the highest possible value and experience for learners. These changes include wider enhancements to our learning program: renaming to **Sumo Logic Academy**, expanding and refining our course catalog, and introducing live remote exam proctoring and digital credentialing. These enhancements will up-level the Sumo Logic learning journey to align with industry training practices.

## Getting started

### How do I access the Training Portal?

1. Log in to Sumo Logic.
1. From your **Home** page, click the **Learn** tab > **Learning Hub**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/learning-hub.png')} alt="Get Certified" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />

You'll be redirected to the **Training** portal, where you can access all courses and certifications.

## Cost and course availability

### Why are you moving from a free to a paid model?

By introducing our new, role-based **Sumo Logic Certified** program, candidates will gain new skills to help drive their careers forward while supplying a legitimized credential you can be proud to share with peers and your professional community. Additionally, passing the new, skills-based assessment will give you a proven, differentiated level of Sumo Logic knowledge to showcase the ability to effectively and proficiently use Sumo Logic products within your organization.

This is accomplished through the following:

* **All new exams**. Exams evaluate based on skill sets, as opposed to the earlier, simple knowledge based assessments. Refer to our full [catalog](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/):
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Search Mastery User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Admin*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Cloud Infrastructure Security Analyst*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Cloud SIEM Practitioner*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Metrics Analyst*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Observability Practitioner*
* **Live, remote exam proctoring**. The exam is proctored through our partner testing company, Kryterion. With a live proctor, we are able to eliminate the possibility of cheating in our exams and legitimize the credential, adding robustness and trust. As a candidate, you can therefore be confident in a legitimate exam delivered in the fairest manner possible, eliminating the possibility of cheating.
* **Digital credentialing**. Finally, after passing your exam, you will be rewarded with a digital badge issued through our partner, [Credly](https://info.credly.com/).

These enhancements bring the Sumo Logic learning journey in-line with what you have come to expect from training practices common in our field.

### How much does it cost to get certified?

The cost of the exams are $100 for Fundamentals, and $150 for others. They can be paid by credit card or by Purchase Order through your Sumo Logic account representative.

### Do I have to pay for taking training courses or just the certification?

Sumo Logic training, including hands-on public virtual instructions, workshops and self-paced learning, will remain free to all our users. Alongside new certifications, private and custom training will continue to be available for purchase.

### Is a voucher included in my training class?

All our training course offerings, including self-paced and public Instructor-led training (ILT), continue to be free of charge. The fee applies for the certification exam and credential only.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?

You will have one year to use the voucher from the date of issue.


## Certification value and renewal

### Why should I get Sumo Logic certified?

Our goal is to provide you with the highest level of value to maximize your Sumo Logic investment. The new, role-based Sumo Logic Certified program will help learners gain new skills to help drive your careers forward while supplying a legitimized credential you can be proud to share with peers and your professional community. Additionally, you will have a proven, differentiated level of Sumo Logic knowledge to showcase the ability to effectively and proficiently use Sumo Logic products within your organization.

### If I already have Sumo Logic certifications, will I lose those?

The new Sumo Logic Certified credentials replace our previous set of certifications. While the previous program is being sunset, the credential will remain valid for one year (Fundamentals courses will be valid for two years). Current exam holders are welcome to renew their credential anytime.

### Can I get re-certified?

Current exam holders are welcome to renew their credentials anytime.

### How long do certifications last?

Certifications are valid for two years before they need to be renewed. This extends validity by one year compared to the previous certification model.

### Are continuing education credits included with the certification?

Not at this time.


## Exam logistics

### How do I get certified and schedule my exam?

Per policy, we recommend a minimum of six months hands-on experience with Sumo Logic prior to taking a certification exam. The process for scheduling the exam is simple and easy:
* You can purchase exam credits directly online by logging into Sumo Logic, clicking the **Learn** tab > **Exam Registration**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/exam-registration.png')} alt="exam registration" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />
* You will then register with our exam proctoring partner, Kryterion, after which you will be able to select and pay for the exam of your choice.
* After taking the exam, results will be shown immediately. If passing, further instructions will follow by email for accepting the digital badge.

Please see the following short video that walks through the workflow to register, pay, schedule and prepare for a proctored exam.

### What are the requirements for taking an exam?

After registering for the exam through our exam partner, Kryterion, you will receive a list of workspace and technical requirements to attend the live proctored exam. Please take note of these. The surrounding desk environment must be clear of all materials and will be reviewed by the proctor before the exam is allowed to proceed.

For full details, refer to the Kryterion’s [Online Testing Requirements](https://kryterion.my.site.com/support/s/article/Online-Testing-Requirements?language=en_US) documentation. You are responsible for meeting system requirements of online proctored exams. Lastly, please be aware that exams are no longer open book/documentation.

### What if I run into a technical issue while taking the test?

Kryterion support is available anytime during the test. You can use the Live Chat or web form at [Kryterion Candidate Support](https://kryterion.force.com/support/s/contactsupport?language=en_US).

### Will I see preliminary exam results on the screen upon completing my test?

Yes, a Pass/Fail result will show on the screen after results have been submitted and the secure proctored exam environment has been left.

### What is the retake policy? Will I have to pay again?

You can retake your exam 48 hours after the previous exam attempt. A new voucher will be required for each attempt. For security and to maintain trust, we do not show which specific questions were incorrectly answered, but an overall score is displayed.

## Badge and community

### Where can I find my new Sumo Logic Certification digital badges?

Certifications badges can be viewed from the [Credly](https://info.credly.com/) portal using the Credly account created after receiving your first certification granted. We also encourage you to join the [Sumo Logic Certification community on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13542036/) and add your badges to your profile!
