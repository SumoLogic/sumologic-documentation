We are leveling up our Sumo Logic certification program with the launch of **Sumo Logic Academy**, our new hub for training and professional development.  

With Sumo Logic Academy, you’ll find an expanded and refined course catalog, live remote exam proctoring through our partner Kryterion, and industry-recognized digital badges issued by Credly. These enhancements bring our program in line with best practices across the industry, giving you credentials you can trust and proudly share with peers, employers, and the wider professional community.

## Getting started

### How do I access the Training Portal?

1. Log in to Sumo Logic.
1. From your **Home** page, click the **Learn** tab > **Learning Hub**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/learning-hub.png')} alt="Get Certified" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

You'll be redirected to the **Training** portal, where you can access all courses and certifications.

## Cost and course availability

### Why are you moving from a free to a paid model?

By investing in a Sumo Logic Certified credential, you’ll gain a meaningful, industry-recognized certification that validates your real-world skills.  

Unlike our previous knowledge-based quizzes, the new exams are skills-based, proctored, and credentialed. This ensures your certification carries weight and distinction, giving you a proven advantage in your career while driving adoption of advanced use cases in your organization.

Improvements include:

* **All new exams**. Assessments now measure skills rather than basic knowledge checks. Refer to our [full catalog](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/), including:
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Search Mastery User*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Admin*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Logs for Security Analyst*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Cloud SIEM Practitioner*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Metrics Analyst*
   * *Sumo Logic Certified Observability Practitioner*
* **Live, remote proctoring**. Exams are administered by Kryterion with live proctors to ensure fairness and integrity.
* **Digital badges**. After passing your exam, you’ll receive a Credly-issued badge you can share on LinkedIn, your resume, and within your organization.

### How much does it cost to get certified?

The cost of exams is $100 for Fundamentals and $150 for advanced certifications. Payment can be made by credit card or Purchase Order through your Sumo Logic account representative.

### Do I have to pay for training courses or just the certification?

All Sumo Logic training, including self-paced eLearning, hands-on public virtual classes, and workshops, remains free to all users. The only cost is for the certification exam itself. Private and custom training will continue to be available for purchase.

### Is a voucher included in my training class?

No. Training remains free of charge, but a fee applies for certification exams.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?

Vouchers are valid for one year from the date of issue.

## Certification value and renewal

### Why should I get Sumo Logic certified?

The role-based Sumo Logic Certified program helps you grow your skills, demonstrate expertise, and earn a credential you can showcase to peers and employers. You’ll build confidence using Sumo Logic products and gain a differentiated level of knowledge to support your organization.

### If I already have Sumo Logic certifications, will I lose those?

The new credentials replace our previous certifications. Existing certifications remain valid until their original expiration (Fundamentals: two years; all others: one year). You’re welcome to renew under the new program at any time.

### Can I get re-certified?

Yes. You can renew your credential at any time by retaking the relevant exam.

### How long do certifications last?

Certifications are valid for two years before they need to be renewed. This is one year longer than our previous model.

### Are continuing education credits included with the certification?

Not at this time.


## Exam logistics

### How do I get certified and schedule my exam?

We recommend at least six months of hands-on Sumo Logic experience before taking a certification exam.

The process for scheduling the exam is easy:
1. Log in to Sumo Logic.
1. From your **Home** page, click the **Learn** tab > **Exam Registration**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/exam-registration.png')} alt="exam registration" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />
1. Purchase your exam credit and register through Kryterion, our proctoring partner.
1. Select and schedule your exam.
1. Results are displayed immediately after completion. If you pass, you’ll receive instructions by email to claim your badge.


### What are the requirements for taking an exam?

Kryterion provides a list of technical and workspace requirements for live proctored exams. Your desk must be clear of materials and will be reviewed by the proctor before the exam begins.

For details, see [Kryterion Online Testing Requirements](https://kryterion.my.site.com/support/s/article/Online-Testing-Requirements?language=en_US).

:::note
Exams are no longer open book.

### What if I run into a technical issue during the exam?

Kryterion support is available during the exam. Use Live Chat or submit a request via [Kryterion Candidate Support](https://kryterion.force.com/support/s/contactsupport?language=en_US).

### Will I see preliminary exam results on the screen upon completing my test?

Yes. A Pass/Fail result will appear on the screen after submission and once you exit the secure proctored environment.

### What is the retake policy? Will I have to pay again?

You can retake your exam 48 hours after the previous attempt. Each retake requires a new voucher. For security, we do not share which specific questions were missed; only your overall score is shown.

## Badges and community

### Where can I find my new Sumo Logic Certification digital badges?

After passing your exam, you’ll receive a digital badge issued via Credly. You can manage and share your badges through the [Credly portal](https://info.credly.com/). We also encourage you to join the [Sumo Logic Certification community on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13542036/) to network and add your badges to your profile to showcase your achievement.
