## Sumo Logic Collectors and Sources

Sumo Logic [Installed Collectors] (../../03Send-Data/Installed-Collectors.md) receive data from one or more [Sources] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors.md).

Collectors collect raw log data, compress it, encrypt it, and send it to the Sumo Cloud, in real time. A single Sumo Logic Collector can collect up to 15,000 events per second or more and has fault tolerance during network or service outages. If you'd like to collect non-traditional machine data, a [Script Source] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Script-Source.md) or [Script Action] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Script-Action.md) provide a great deal of flexibility to collect files.

For system requirement details, see [Installed Collector Requirements](system-requirements.md).

Sumo Logic [Hosted Collectors] (../../03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors.md) are hosted in the Sumo Cloud and receive data from one or more [Sources] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors.md). You can configure it to collect data from various cloud services like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, G Suite, and Microsoft Office 365. It offers [Cloud Syslog Sources] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/Cloud-Syslog-Source.md) to receive syslog data and [HTTP Sources] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source.md) to receive logs and metrics.
