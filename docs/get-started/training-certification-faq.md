## Training Lab Environment

The Training Lab Environment will enable you to get hands-on practice following the lessons covered in our learning experiences. A Sumo Logic environment curated to work with the examples and lab exercises provided with our courses is available 24/7 all year round for you to practice.

### How do I access the Training Lab environment?

1. Choose a number between 001 and 999. Remember this number, since you'll use it in all of your labs.

1. In the new browser window, go to [https://service.sumologic.com](https://service.sumologic.com).
1. Enter the credentials found at the top of the **Become a Sumo Expert** page of the **Training Portal**.

    The Training Lab Environment password changes monthly, so you may have to check back there often.
    :::
1. You'll know you have access when you see **Sumo Logic Training** when you hover over the user in the bottom left corner.
1. Save your training username for use during this training. It's a good idea to have both the Sumo Logic training lab environment and this self-paced program open in separate windows, so you can toggle between them.
