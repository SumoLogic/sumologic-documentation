### Why are certification exams paid?

Effective September 2025, Sumo Logic exams are skills‑based, professionally proctored, and credentialed. This ensures your certification reflects real‑world ability and carries weight with peers and employers.

Improvements include:

* **All‑new, skills‑based exams** that measure practical proficiency.
* **Live remote proctoring** via Kryterion for fairness and integrity.
* **Digital badges** issued by Credly that you can share on LinkedIn and your resume.

**Fundamentals** is $100. All other certifications are $150. Payment is by credit card or purchase order through your Sumo Logic account representative.

### Do I have to pay for training courses or just the certification?

Training is free. Fees apply only to certification exams. Private and custom training remains available for purchase.

### Is a voucher included in my training class?

No. Training is free, but certification exams require payment.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?

Vouchers are valid for one year from the date of issue.

## Exam logistics

### How do I schedule an exam?


We recommend at least six months of hands‑on Sumo Logic experience before taking an exam.

1. Sign in to Sumo Logic.
2. From the **Home** page, click the **Learn** tab > **Exam Registration**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/exam-registration.png')} alt="Exam registration" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

4. Select and schedule your exam.
5. View your pass/fail result immediately after submission. If you pass, follow the email instructions to claim your **Credly** badge.

### What are the requirements for taking an exam?

Kryterion provides technical and workspace requirements for live proctored exams. Your desk must be clear of materials and will be reviewed by the proctor before the exam begins. See [Kryterion Online Testing Requirements](https://kryterion.my.site.com/support/s/article/Online-Testing-Requirements?language=en_US).

### What if I run into a technical issue during the exam?

Kryterion support is available during the exam. Use Live Chat or submit a request via [Kryterion Candidate Support](https://www.kryterion.com/fast-help-current-and-future-test-candidates/).

### Will I see preliminary results on screen when I finish?

Yes. A pass/fail result appears after submission once you exit the secure proctored environment.

### What is the retake policy? Will I have to pay again?

You can retake your exam 48 hours after a previous attempt. Each retake requires a new voucher. For security, only your overall score is shown.

### Where can I find my Sumo Logic certification digital badges?

After passing an exam, you’ll receive a digital badge via Credly. Manage and share badges through the Credly portal. We encourage you to join the Sumo Logic Certification community on LinkedIn and add your badges to your profile.

### My badges were issued to my work email address. Can I add a personal email address to my Credly account?

Yes. To add an alternative email address to your Credly profile, see [Credly Help Center | Can I add multiple emails to my account?](https://support.credly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021220951-Can-I-add-multiple-emails-to-my-account).

While we're required to issue badges to the same email you use to sign in to Sumo Logic, adding a personal email in Credly keeps your badges portable.
