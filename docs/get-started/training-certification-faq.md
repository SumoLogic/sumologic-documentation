## Certifications

:::sumo micro lesson

Sumo Logic Academy certifications use proctored, skills-based exams with digital badges issued through Credly. We recommend six months of hands-on experience before registering.

### What are the benefits of certification?

By investing in a Sumo Logic Certified credential, you’ll gain a meaningful, industry-recognized certification that validates your real-world skills.

Unlike our previous knowledge-based quizzes, the new exams are skills-based, proctored, and credentialed. This ensures your certification carries weight and distinction, giving you a proven advantage in your career while driving adoption of advanced use cases in your organization.

Improvements include:
* **All new exams**. Assessments now measure skills rather than basic knowledge checks. Refer to our [full catalog of certifications](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/).
* **Live, remote proctoring**. Exams are administered by Kryterion with live proctors to ensure fairness and integrity.
* **Digital badges**. After passing your exam, you’ll receive a Credly-issued badge you can share on LinkedIn, your resume, and within your organization.

### What certifications does Sumo Logic offer?

* *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Search Mastery User*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Admin*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Logs for Security Analyst*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Cloud SIEM Practitioner*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Metrics Analyst*

More information [here](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training#certified).

### Do I have to take certifications in a specific order?

No. However, we recommend passing *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User* before attempting advanced certifications.

### How long do certifications last?

Certifications are valid for two years before renewal is required.

### Can I get re‑certified?

Yes. You can renew at any time by retaking the relevant exam.

### If I already have Sumo Logic certifications, will I lose those?

The new credentials replace our previous certifications. Existing certifications remain valid until their original expiration (Fundamentals: two years; all others: one year). You’re welcome to renew under the new program at any time.

### Are there fees for certifications?

While self-paced and public live training options are free, there are fees associated with certification exams.

The *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User* certification exam fee costs $100, and all others are $150. Payment is by credit card or purchase order through your Sumo Logic account representative or reseller.

### Is a voucher included in my training class? Do I have to pay for training courses or just the certification?

All Sumo Logic training, including self-paced eLearning, hands-on public virtual classes, and workshops, remains free to all users. A separate cost applied to the certification exam itself. Private and custom training will continue to be available for purchase.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?

After purchasing a certification voucher, the exam must be taken within one year from the date of issue.

### Are continuing education credits included with the certification?

Not at this time.

### I cannot install third-party software on my company-issued device. Can I use a personal device to take exams?

Sumo Logic Academy uses [Kryterion Webassessor](https://www.kryterion.com/blog/the-evolution-of-webassessor-from-bold-beginnings-to-a-future-powered-by-ai/) for exam registration. To ensure a secure testing environment, you must install the "Lockdown Browser" to attend a live proctored Sumo Logic Certified exam. Because many corporate IT policies restrict third-party software, we strongly recommend using a personal device to complete your exam. In this case, simply follow the normal process to access Kryterion through the in-product **Learn** tab from your personal device.

For customers whose access to their Sumo Logic organization is also restricted to approved company machines, a standalone login process is required to log in to Kryterion Webassessor to attend the exam via a personal machine.

If you cannot access your Sumo Logic environment from your personal machine, use the following process to enroll you into Webassessor through our standard single sign-on (SSO) procedure, and set a password on your account so that you can log in from a different machine without needing to access Sumo Logic first:

1. Log in from your work machine:
   1. Sign in to Sumo Logic as normal.
   1. Select the **Learn** tab in the UI.

   1. Once logged in to Webassessor, click **Edit Profile** at the top. Copy your username into a note for later use. Note that this will be a string of alphanumeric characters.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/kryterion-webassessor-registration.png')} alt="Webassessor" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />
   1. Click **Log Out**, then on the next screen, **Log In**.
   1. Now click **Forgot Password**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/kryterion-webassessor-forgot-password.png')} alt="Webassessor forgot password" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />
   1. Paste your username (not your email address) and click **Submit**.
   1. An email with a password reset link will be sent to your inbox. Click the link in the email and set a password. Note the password for future use.
You can now log in to your Webassessor account using both single sign on (SSO) and from the Webassessor login page.
1. Log in from your personal machine:
   1. Access the Kryterion Webassessor standalone login page.
   1. Log in using your username (not your email address) and password set in the previous section.
