### How do I fix the Sumo Logic Data Pipeline error?

If you're seeing the following error when starting a new lesson, this is typically due to a browser setting.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/get-started/error.png')} alt="Screenshot showing Sumo Logic data pipeline error regarding missing authentication cookie" />

Here are some fixes:

* Refresh your browser. Clear your browser’s cookies and cache.

* Confirm your internet connection.
* Attempt to play the video or reload the lesson in an Incognito or Private window by clicking your browser's menu button and selecting "New Incognito/Private Window".
   * If the content successfully loads in the new window, this is an indicator that a browser extension is likely preventing the content from loading.
