See [Kryterion Online Testing Requirements](https://kryterion.my.site.com/support/s/article/Online-Testing-Requirements?language=en_US).

### What if I run into a technical issue during the exam?

You can retake your exam 48 hours after a previous attempt. Each retake requires a new voucher. For security, only your overall score is shown.

## Badges and community

### Where can I find my Sumo Logic certification digital badges?

After passing an exam, you'll receive a digital badge via Credly. Manage and share badges through the Credly portal. We encourage you to join the Sumo Logic Certification community on LinkedIn and add your badges to your profile.

### My badges were issued to my work email address. Can I add a personal email address to my Credly account?

Yes. To add an alternative email address to your Credly profile, see [Credly Help Center | Can I add multiple emails to my account?](https://support.credly.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021220951-Can-I-add-multiple-emails-to-my-account).

While we're required to issue badges to the same email you use to sign in to Sumo Logic, adding a personal email in Credly keeps your badges portable.
