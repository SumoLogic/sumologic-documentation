### What are the benefits of certification?

By investing in a Sumo Logic Certified credential, you’ll gain a meaningful, industry-recognized certification that validates your real-world skills.

Unlike our previous knowledge-based quizzes, the new exams are skills-based, proctored, and credentialed. This ensures your certification carries weight and distinction, giving you a proven advantage in your career while driving adoption of advanced use cases in your organization.

Improvements include:
* **All new exams**. Assessments now measure skills rather than basic knowledge checks. Refer to our [full catalog of certifications](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/).
* **Live, remote proctoring**. Exams are administered by Kryterion with live proctors to ensure fairness and integrity.
* **Digital badges**. After passing your exam, you’ll receive a Credly-issued badge you can share on LinkedIn, your resume, and within your organization.

### What certifications does Sumo Logic offer?

* *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Search Mastery User*
* *Sumo Logic Certified Admin*

### How long do certifications last?

### Are there fees for certifications?

While self-paced and public live training options are free, there are fees associated with certification exams.

The *Sumo Logic Certified Fundamentals User* certification exam fee costs $100, and all others are $150. Payment is by credit card or purchase order through your Sumo Logic account representative or reseller.

### Is a voucher included in my training class? Do I have to pay for training courses or just the certification?

All Sumo Logic training, including self-paced eLearning, hands-on public virtual classes, and workshops, remains free to all users. A separate cost applied to the certification exam itself. Private and custom training will continue to be available for purchase.

### How long do I have to use my voucher?
