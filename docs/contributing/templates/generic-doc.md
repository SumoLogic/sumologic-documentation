<!--Copy this markdown file and replace it with your own documentation. To view the full list of markdown components, see our [Style Guide](/docs/contributing/style-guide).

Replace the title above in the [Frontmatter section](/docs/contributing/style-guide#frontmatter) with yours. This will render as an H1 header. All other header sections should be H2, H3, H4, or H5.-->

## Sample H2 section

<!--
To add an image, save the .png file with a simple name to the `/static/img` folder. For many images, consider guide or product feature folders. Include alt text and the file location `/img/folder-name/` and file name.

Example:

![Sumo Logic logo](/img/sumo-square.png)
-->

### Instructions

<!--
Always use `1.` to start your instructions. You don't need to actually number the list. It will automatically number for you on build.

1. Click **Collections**, then **Sources** tab.
1. Next step, just write it out.
    * Bullet list just tab and use `*` or `1.`.
    * Next bullet.<br/>![Sumo Logic logo](/img/sumo-square.png)
1. The numbers continue with content indented above!

Here is an example table:

| Item | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Dashboard | *Markdown* **works** `here`, too. |
| *Query* | [More info](/docs/search/search-query-language)! |
