### Schema Registry

The **Schema Registry** dashboard provides details on schema operations, request counts, and traffic types for your Acme.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor the distribution of schema operations (CREATE, READ, DELETE) to ensure proper usage and identify potential issues with schema management.
* Analyze the ratio of public vs. private traffic to understand access patterns and potential security concerns.
* Track schema count trends over time to manage growth and capacity planning for your Schema Registry.
* Correlate request counts with operation types to identify unusual spikes or drops in schema-related activities.
