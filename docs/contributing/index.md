Sumo Logic Documentation is an Open Source project available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation). This section will grow as we answer questions and provide support for submissions and new content. Here you'll information on creating files, writing in markdown, using our templates, submitting pull requests (PRs), and more.


## Prerequisites

* You must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) to contribute to Sumo Logic documentation.
* We recommend adding [2FA protection](https://devdocs.magento.com/contributor-guide/contributing.html#two-factor) when contributing to Sumo Logic repositories.


## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways that you can contribute to Sumo Docs, beyond writing code. Here's a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

### Submit an Issue

To report a bug or request more information, you can help us by [**Submitting a GitHub Issue**](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues/new/choose) to our repository. Enter as much information as you can, including content corrections, steps to reproduce, command/code updates, and clarifying questions. To share your knowledge, submit a PR with a fix.

Before submitting an issue, you can browse our [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues) to see if someone has already reported it, and join the discussion via comments.

### Edit a Page

1. If you come across a bug on our site, scroll to the bottom of that doc and click the **Edit this page** link. This will open your selected doc in **Edit file** mode on our GitHub repo website.
1. Apply your edits to the file.
1. Scroll to the bottom and select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**. In the field underneath, enter a name for your branch and click **Propose Change**. This will fork and submit changes to us for review.


### Fork and Clone the Sumo Docs Repository

For larger contributions like extensive edits or a creating new doc, we recommend forking our repo, making changes in a new branch, and submitting a PR for review.

Feel free to reach out to us, the Docs Team, to discuss. We're happy to work with you on the project and talk through rewriting content, changing flow, adding a new topic or section, and deprecating content.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [Sumo Docs repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation). Remember to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and update branches as needed.
1. Review our README documentation guidelines.
1. Create a new branch from your cloned repo/fork using a name that best describes the work or references a GitHub issue number. For example: `<your initials>-apps-gitlab`.
1. Edit or create markdown (.md) files in your branch. See [Create a Document](create-document.md) and our [Style Guide](/docs/contributing/style-guide) for more info.
1. Commit your changes to the branch with a meaningful message.<br/>![pull request](/img/contributing/commit.png). Use descriptive commit messages (and issue or ticket numbers, if applicable) detailing the content updates you are entering for content. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
  >
  > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
  ```
1. Set permissions to allow maintainers to edit and update the PR ([learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)).
1. Push your branch to the repo/fork.
1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) after pushing your branch. If you see an option to **Compare & Pull Request** for your branch click this.<br/>![compare](/img/contributing/compare-pr.png)
   * If you don't see it, create a new [PR](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/compare).
      1. Select `main` for the base branch. This is the branch all staging and production content builds from).
      1. Select your branch for the **compare**.
      1. Click **Create Pull Request**.
1. On the Pull Request page, enter the following:
   * Make sure **base** branch is `main` and **compare** branch is the one you pushed.
   * Enter a title for the PR.

#### Pull Request Submission Guidelines

We currently cut branches from <code>main</code> for accepting documentation. As our processes refine and work expands, we may use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development content.

As PRs are merged to the main branch by the Sumo Logic Docs Team, the content builds and deploys to a staging site. This can be reviewed and tested thoroughly on a server, rather than a local.

When all content is tested and ready for live, a Sumo Logic Docs Team member can tag a release to build and deploy to Production. This site is live to the world to search, use, and read to learn Sumo Logic.
