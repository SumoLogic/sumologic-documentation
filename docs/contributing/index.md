Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sumo Logic documentation! We welcome all contributions, from minor typo fixes to new topics and tutorials. Your expertise and sharing helps fellow users learn and expand their knowledge of Sumo Logic. Sumo Logic Documentation is an Open Source project available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation). This section will grow as we answer questions and provide support for submissions and new content.

The docs in this section provide information on creating files, writing in markdown, using our templates, submitting pull requests, and more.


## Before You Begin

* You must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) to contribute to Sumo Logic documentation
* We recommend adding [2FA protection](https://devdocs.magento.com/contributor-guide/contributing.html#two-factor) when contributing to Sumo Logic repositories.


## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways that you can contribute to Sumo Docs, beyond writing code. Here is a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

* For minor changes like a typos or small bugs, you could use the [Edit Page button](#edit-page-directly) or [submit an issue](#submit-issue-or-bug).
* For major contributions like extensive text/sample code edits or brand new docs, you could [submit an issue](#submit-issue-or-bug) or [clone our repo files](#clone-our-repository) to your local machine, make changes in a branch, and submit a pull request for review. Feel free to reach out to us, the Docs Team, to discuss. We are happy to work with you on the project and talk through rewriting content, changing flow, adding a new topic or section, and deprecating content.

### Submit Issue

If you find a bug in documentation or site tools, or want to request more information, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues/new/choose) to our GitHub Repository. You can enter an issue through GitHub or from any page on the documentation site. To share your knowledge, submit a Pull Request with a fix.

Enter as much information as you can, including content corrections, steps to reproduce, command or code updates, or questions for clarifications.

<!--To easily submit an issue for a specific page, click Report an issue (coming soon) on the documentation web page and include your feedback.-->

When submitting an issue, you also can check the [existing one](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues) to see if someone has already reported it.

### Submit Feature Request

You can request a new feature by [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Afeature&template=feature_request.md&title=) to our GitHub Repository.

### Edit Page directly

While reviewing content on the site, you can click the **Edit this page** link, located at the bottom of each doc page. This will open your selected doc in our GitHub repo website.

1. On a doc where you find an error, scroll to the bottom of the doc and click the **Edit this page**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/editpage.png')} alt="editpage" width="175"/>
1. The markdown file opens in GitHub.
1. Make your edits to the file. You can also view the doc's History here as well.
1. Scroll to the bottom and select **Create a new branch...**. Enter a name for the branch and click **Propose Change**. This will fork and submit changes to us for review.


### Clone Sumo Docs Repository

Another option is to clone the GitHub repository and edit locally. This is common for developers, working with GitHub tools, Git commands, and code editors like VSCode or Atom.


#### Fork and clone

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [sumologic-documentation](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) repository. Remember to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and update branches as needed.
1. Review documentation guidelines.

If you use a fork instead of a branch, please set permissions to allow maintainers to edit and update the PR. See [Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

#### Commit Message Guidelines

Use descriptive commit messages detailing the content updates you are entering for content. Mention issue or ticket numbers as relevant for work.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

For example:
```bash
$ git commit -m "Updating query for metrics"
```

#### Create a branch

1. Create a new branch from your cloned repo/fork using a name that best describes the work or references a GitHub issue number. For example: `<your initials>-tracing-update` or `<your initials>-apps-gitlab`.
1. Edit or create markdown (.md) files in your branch. See [Create a Document](create-document.md) and [Markdown Features](markdown-cheat-sheet.md) for more info.

#### Push your changes

1. Commit your changes to the branch with a meaningful message.<br/>![pull request](/img/contributing/commit.png)
1. Push your branch to the repo/fork.

#### Create a pull request

1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) after pushing your branch. If you see an option to **Compare & Pull Request** for your branch click this.<br/>![compare](/img/contributing/compare-pr.png)
   * If you don't see it, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/compare).
      1. Select `main` for the base branch. This is the branch all staging and production content builds from).
      1. Select your branch for the **compare**.
      1. Click **Create Pull Request**.
1. On the Pull Request page, enter the following:
   * Make sure **base** branch is `main` and **compare** branch is the one you pushed.
   * Enter a title for the PR.
   * Include an issue number from GitHub or Jira, etc.
   * Describe what changed, new pages, updates.
   * Apply a label that best describes your contribution.

1. Click **Create Pull Request**.<br/> ![pull request](/img/contributing/pull-request.png)
1. Sign our Contributor License Agreement (built using [cla-bot](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/)). We allow  individual contributions and contributions made on behalf of companies. If you have any questions, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues).

Docs Team members will review contributions, provide feedback, and approve. When approved, the Docs Team will merge and update staging. Updates to production will be handled by the Docs Team.

#### Pull Request Submission Guidelines

We currently cut branches from <code>main</code> for accepting documentation. As our processes refine and work expands, we may use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development content.

As Pull Requests (PRs) are merged to the main branch by the Sumo Logic Docs Team, the content builds and deploys to a staging site. This can be reviewed and tested thoroughly on a server, rather than a local.

When all content is tested and ready for live, a Sumo Logic Docs Team member can tag a release to build and deploy to Production. This site is live to the world to search, use, and read to learn Sumo Logic.


## Recommended Authoring Tools

If you're new to GitHub and writing [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) documentation, we recommend using the following applications:

* [Atom](https://atom.io): Create new branches, stage and commit, push and pull, resolve merge conflicts, view pull requests and more - all from within your editor. The GitHub package comes bundled with Atom.
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): Easy-to-use interface to update your local machine clone, create branches, push to GitHub and more.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Development application to open the repo, edit and create files, and preview pages as you write. We recommend the following extensions:
   * Markdown All in One
   * Markdown Preview GitHub Styling
   * Markdown Preview Enhanced
   * Markdown Preview Mermaid and Mermaid Markdown Syntax Highlighting for charts and graphs
* [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) - Terminal application for MacOS. You can also install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for theming.
