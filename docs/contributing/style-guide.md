import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

This page describes how to author Sumo Docs, which are written in GitHub-flavored markdown.

The Sumo Logic Style Guide is a guide to language at Sumo Logic, so that we can speak as one company with a unified voice, and know what we mean when we talk about our product. The Style Guide began as a document used by the Documentation team to make decisions about tone, voice, and word usage. We thought it would be useful to share with everyone in our community.

This is a living document. If you're looking for a style rule or UI component usage that's not defined here, let us know. The Documentation team will look it up and add usage guidance.

## Writing resources

If you need help with a convention, word to use, or format to follow, we will keep a cheatsheet of styles here. We also follow:

* [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/)
* *[The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)*
* [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
  * [User Input | Formatting Text in Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions)

For terminology usage guidance, see our [Word List](/docs/contributing/word-list).

If you're new to writing tech content or would like to learn more, check out these resources:
* [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/). Association of tech writers, developers, trainers, and more that have collected ideas, created training and guidelines, and actively discuss documentation.
* [Google Technical Writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing). Self-paced courses to refine your writing. The courses may use a style different from ours, but still an excellent way to get started.
* [Every Page is Page One](https://everypageispageone.com/examples-of-eppo-topics/). A helpful method for considering what goes into a page is to think of every page as page one. With the extreme use of search engines or sharing a link to find content, users may land in the middle of a section or tutorial. These ideas help hone your content and focus on user needs.

Helpful blogs on tech writing:
* [Writing for the Web](https://www.nngroup.com/topic/writing-web/). Guidance on writing for the web, including insights on technical writing and learning.
* [Feathers](https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/). Blog for technical and fiction writing.
* [I'd rather be writing](https://idratherbewriting.com/). Guides and thoughts on tech writing process and content.

The Documentation team will review submissions, provide suggested edits, add new content into the navigation, and answer any questions you have.

:::tip
To create a new doc quickly, use a template. You can copy and paste the file, add your content, and submit a PR.

## Voice and tone

* **Clarity and professionalism**. We are clear, genuine, and trustworthy. We understand that our customers entrust us with their vital data and never make light about our commitment to data access and security.
* **Engagement and assistance**. The reader should feel confident and informed. We should strive to engage our customers and show them where to get additional assistance when needed.
* **Professional description**. Describe Sumo Logic in a professional and truthful manner. Avoid generic, unsubstantial adjectives like "very" or phrases like "we're the best". Instead, illustrate these points by letting our product speak for itself.
* **Conversational tone**. Avoid using a stiff, institutional voice. Instead, write with an instructive and conversational tone, using the sort of words that you would use in a face-to-face conversation. For example, when linking to the support site, use terms like "Need help? Let us know" instead of "Please email our support personnel" to give our company a friendly face.
* **Reader address**. Address the reader as "you", as you would in conversation. For example, instead of saying, "The user must provide his or her API key" or "One must provide their API key", say, "You'll need to provide your API key".
* **Readability and SEO**. Instructional content and blog posts should be written at approximately the 8th-grade reading level, particularly in introductory sections, for readability and SEO. You can test your content [here](http://www.writingtester.com).
* **Brand guidelines**. Our brand guideline is to always refer to “Sumo Logic”, rather than Sumo. To be more conversational, it is also fine to say “we”.
* **Gentle Language**. Use “need to” instead of “have to” or “must”. “Have to” and “must” can sound harsh and unfriendly.
* **Judicious use of absolutes**. Be judicious in use of “always” and “never”. Sometimes it’s appropriate to say “always” or “never”. Keep in mind though that “always” can imply a result that is not guaranteed, and “never” may very well not be the case — the exception makes the rule.
* **Error messaging**. When explaining a process or procedure, clarity is critical. Edit words that distract or confuse. Put yourself into the reader's shoes and think about what actions you recommend to them when an error message is displayed, rather than merely stating what went wrong. Example: "Could not create the user." vs "This email is already registered in the system. Please use a different email or contact Sumo Logic for assistance."
* **Humor**. We have a sense of humor! Conveying that we do serious work, but we do not take ourselves too seriously, makes Sumo Logic feel likable.

### Active voice

When writing instructions, use the active voice whenever possible. This example below gives a call to action for the reader or user to effectively get something done. It also reduces word count and keeps instructions clear.

#### General statements

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Sumo Logic ingests multiple streams of data. | Multiple streams of data are ingested by Sumo Logic. |

#### Task directives

We need them to complete a task. No need for please.

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Build the query using the following... | Please build the query using the following... |

#### Instruction introduction (stem)

Introduce your instructions with the goal, then dive into the instructions. This is called a stem, and it helps focus the task and keeps you active:

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| To add a new collector:<br/>1. Access Sumo Logic and find the... | When you need to add a new collector, access Sumo Logic and find the... |

### Inclusive language

By writing inclusively and using culturally neutral language, our words resonate with global audiences and make everyone feel welcome, no matter their race, gender, socioeconomic status, and ability.

#### Avoid Regional Language

* Do not use idioms, slang, expressions, or terminology only understood by a specific region or group.

#### Simplify Language

* Avoid overly technical jargon.
* Don’t use words just because they sound better. Choose short, simple words over long and complicated ones.

#### Gender Neutrality

* Unless you're referring to a specific person, do not use gender pronouns (he/she).

#### Cultural Neutrality

* Use culturally neutral terms to replace terms with negative connotations. For example:

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| "allowlist"<br/>"denylist"<br/>"placeholder data"<br/>"primary" or "main"<br/>"press" or "click" | "whitelist"<br/>"blacklist"<br/>"dummy data"<br/>"master"<br/>"hit" |

## Doc structure summary

* [**Frontmatter**](#metadata-frontmatter). Metadata formatted in YAML that goes at the top.
* **Introduction**. Tell the user in the doc introduction (first paragraph) what the page teaches, why they should read it, and who should read it.
* **Contextual guidance**. Let the user know what step/place they are in for a tutorial in the introduction/at top. The layout automatically provides a previous/next at the bottom of the page.
* **Linking**. Link out to important concepts and overviews for additional reading. This is helpful for instruction pages or tutorials.
* **Conciseness**. Keep instructions concise, easy to follow, and with not too many screenshots.
* [**Admonitions**](#admonitions). Include any notes, warnings, tips, or other admonitions.


## Abbreviations

Avoid the use of abbreviations like “e.g.”, “i.e.”, and “etc.”. Although they may be well understood, such abbreviations don’t support our goal of a conversational tone. In other words, don’t use language you wouldn’t use verbally.

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| for example | e.g. |

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| that is | i.e. |

## Acronyms

An acronym uses the first initials of a word or phrase, for brevity. Our industry is full of them, and they can get confusing if their usage isn't clear. Acronyms should be capitalized, if not used directly in a query. Unless the usage is clear from the context, for the first usage, spell out the phrase, then present the acronym in parenthesis. For example: Secure Shell (SSH).

All companies have numerous acronyms for products, features, solutions, and more. Our documentation includes acronyms for Sumo Logic and third-party software. Always fully spell out the first instance of the acronym on the page, then you can use it throughout. Do not spell out in a heading, but in paragraphs or bullets.

For example, the first time you use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), you introduce or use it like that the first time on the page. Through the rest of the page, you can use ALB.

## Admonitions

We refer to callout elements like Tip, Note, Warning, and Caution as admonitions.

Docusaurus has a special syntax to create admonitions and callouts, including note, tip, important, caution, warning, and sumo. You can use markdown content in the admonitions, code blocks, links, bullets, images, videos, and much more.

## Beta releases

### Closed beta

Closed beta release features are exclusively available to participating customers. Documentation for these features is not publicly accessible; Sumo Logic representatives provide the documentation links only to the involved customers. These links are excluded from our table of contents.

To format a closed beta release:

1. Underneath the frontmatter, add:
   * The [Robots meta tag](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag), which prevents search crawlers from picking it up.
   * The Sumo Logic Docs beta label.
     ```md {7-11}
     ---
     id: xyz-source
     title: XYZ Source (Beta)
     description: The XYZ Source provides a secure endpoint to receive event data.
     ---

     <head>
      <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
     </head>

     <p><a href="/docs/beta"><span className="beta">Beta</span></a></p>

     First paragraph goes here...
     ```
2. Publish the document.

### Open beta

When the feature moves to open beta, it becomes available to all customers. Help topics for an open beta feature have a beta label at the top, appear in the site table of contents, and are linked from the [Beta Features](/docs/beta/) section.

To format an open beta release:

1. Underneath the frontmatter, add the beta label.
   ```md {7}
   ---
   id: xyz-source
   title: XYZ Source (Beta)
   description: The XYZ Source provides a secure endpoint to receive  event data.
   ---

   <p><a href="/docs/beta"><span className="beta">Beta</span></a></p>

   First paragraph goes here...
   ```
1. Add the doc file path to `sidebars.ts` under its appropriate section, then add to the beta section with the same file path. For example, if your doc path is `docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new.md`, add it to the `get-started/` section, then add to the `beta/` section with the same file path.
     ```js title="sidebars.ts"
     getstarted: [
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Welcome to Sumo Logic',
         items: [
           'get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new',
           ...
     beta: [
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Beta',
         items: [
           'get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new',
           ...
     ```
1. Publish the doc.

When the feature goes GA, remove the beta label and remove a description of the feature from the `/docs/beta` section.

## Capitalization

* Title case (initial cap) all doc titles. Example: `Global Intelligence for Apache Tomcat App`
* Sentence case all other headers (H2, H3, H4). The only exception is proper nouns, which are always title case. Example: `Throughput signals and contributing factors`


## Code (inline)

Use single backticks (\` \`) to format inline code as monospace font. Example use cases include commands, operators, API method names, and error messages. For information on code blocks (scripts), see [Code Blocks](#code-blocks).

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```
`_view = sumologic_slo_output`
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

`_view = sumologic_slo_output`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Code (blocks)

Use code blocks to format scripts, such as the JSON example below. This is important for scripts and CLI. Format blocks of code by placing triple backticks before and after the code.

:::note
Code blocks are intended only for code snippets that users can copy, paste, and run in their own terminal. Do not use code block formatting for error messages (see [Code (Inline)](#code-inline)), as this isn't something you'd run in a terminal.
:::

If you know the code language, include that in the first set of backticks to activate syntax highlighting. See [this list](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) of supported languages. Use `sql` to format Sumo queries and `json` for Sumo logs.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

```json

  "employee": {
    "name": "Jane Smith",   
    "team": "Operations",   
    "manager": true  
  }  
}  
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here's how to add a title to your code block.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/title-codeblock.png')} alt="JSX snippet with title" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>
  )
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To highlight lines in the code, use `{#}` in the title line with lines numbers. This example highlights lines 2 through 6.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/highlight-codeblock.png')} alt="SQL code snippet with highlighted lines" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

```sql {2-6}
_sourceCategory=reinvent/travel/checkout
[subquery:_sourceCategory=reinvent/travel/nginx
     | count by src_ip
     | topk(1,_count)
     | compose src_ip keywords
]
| json field=_raw "funcName"
| where funcname in ("process_cart","charge")
| if (funcname = "process_cart" , "Checkout", "Purchased") as funcname
| count by funcname
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For a full list of options, see [Docusaurus Code Blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks).


## Collapsible text blocks

Use the Docusaurus [Details](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features#details) feature to collapse long, additional content and long code samples. When collapsed, the content can be searched, but not displayed, when loading a page. Place long lists or lots of content in this section. The reader can expand/collapse as needed. Important content like required steps and instructions should not be placed in an expander.

You can include markdown content in expanders including code samples, embedded videos, bulleted lists, and more.

Add a title for the expander between the `<summary>` tags. Then, add all content after `<summary>` tags and before the closing `<details>` tags.

        }
    }
]
```

</Tabs>




## Contractions

Using contractions contributes to our goals of striking a conversational, friendly tone.

It's okay to use common contractions like “I'm”, “they're”, and “you’ll”. Spell out all negative contractions (for example: use "cannot", not "cannot"), as they can be easily mistaken for the opposite meaning.

Avoid less common contractions, like “should’ve”, or “it’ll”.

## Dates

* Use the month’s full name (September). If space is a concern, use 3-letter abbreviations (Sep).
* Avoid writing dates numerically (7-25-17) and ordinal indicators (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th). Use the 12-hour clock unless the user has specified otherwise, followed by am or pm in lowercase letters without a space.
* When including a time zone, append the time zone’s abbreviation after the “am” or “pm”, separated by a space.
* To show a time range, use an en dash and include the “am” or “pm” after both times.

:::note
The notation used in the UI time range editor is an exception to some of these rules.
:::

## Downloadable files

To link to a downloadable asset file, such as a `.yaml`, `.json`, or `.xml`:

1. Drag and drop your file to the `static/files` folder. In this example, we'll drop in a file called `domainCollector.ps1`.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/static-file.png')} alt="static/files folder" width="250"/>
1. Go to your doc in progress and use the following syntax to link the file:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```md
<a href="/files/domainCollector.ps1" target="_blank">domainCollector.ps1</a>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

<a href="/files/domainCollector.ps1" target="_blank">domainCollector.ps1</a>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Nearly all file formats are supported. For more information, see [Docusaurus Static Assets](https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets).

If your file is available in another public Sumo Logic repo, provide the standard URL link. [Here's an example](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/main/examples/fargate/install-metrics.sh).

## Emphasis

### Bold

Use **bold** for UI elements you interact with, such as a button or tab.

### Italics

Use _italics_ for:
* Defining a term the first time. For example, when defining a collector the first time, you would italicize once with the definition.
* Providing content to enter into a field.

### Underlines

Never underline text.

```markdown

## Font

We use Lab Grotesque in our docs site and across all Sumo Logic media.


## Headings

Use hashtags `#` to indicate the heading level and group content. Always start with H2 headers (`##`) in your doc body. Link anchors also generate automatically.

* We mark a heading using a number of # for the level. This section is using an H3 heading, which is `### Headings`.
*  Never use H1 (`#`) in your document. This is generated automatically by the page title (`title:` in frontmatter).
* Headings should always be clean, plain text. Do not use **bold**, _italics_, or code ticks.
* Be careful of using special characters. Dashes are ok, but try to avoid other punctuation.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```
## I'm an H2

### I'm an H3

#### I'm an H4

##### I'm an H5

###### I'm an H6
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/headersizes.png')} alt="header sizes" width="300"/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Headings must be used in correct order. The subsection of an H2 header would be H3 - you wouldn't jump to an H4 or H5. Skipping over a header level affects search and SEO structures to search crawlers like Google. Docusaurus carefully formats generated pages to ensure strong search and SEO, and malformed structures can reduce that strength.

### Documenting procedures

When a topic provides instructions for a significant multi-step process, organize the content in sections with headings that signpost the nature of the information. Include "Step" in the heading to make it clear that the section is part of a larger configuration process. For example:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/style-steps-headings.png')} alt="headers with steps" width="300"/>


## Hub pages

To generate a full list of docs within a folder, add this code to the file:

```
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

## Guide contents

In this section, we'll introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

This is best used in an index file. Include a list of all files and folders in that folder to the file. See any category file for a section in the site for how this looks.


<!--
## Import GitHub Repo Files

To embed a code sample from a file in a GitHub repository, use `reference` in the code block with a link to the file. The code sample is embedded using the language with a link to the original file.

This code references a script file: ` ```bash reference`, for example:

```bash reference
https://github.com/ccaum/sumologic-solution-templates/blob/github_getting_started_guide/software-development-optimization-terraform/scripts/getting-started
```

You can use a link to a file embedding the entire file, or embed a range of code lines using `#L` and a line range at the end of the link, such as `#L105-108`.
-->


## Images

### Add an image

1. Save your image to the `/static/img` folder. This folder structure mirrors the doc section folders.
   * When updating existing images (like if there's a Sumo UI change), do not add a new version; always replace existing images. Image files take up a lot of room and can slow build times.
   * File format be .png or .gif.
1. Add the import line to the top of your doc, underneath the [front matter header](#metadata-frontmatter), if it's not already there.
   ```
   import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
   ```
1. Copy the below code snippet and paste it where you want your image to appear.
   ```
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/<your-image-file-path>.png')} alt="<your image description>" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="<insert-pixel-number>" />
   ```
1. Replace with file path above with your own image file path. The file path must start with `img` (do not preface it with `/static`) because Docusaurus builds and saves these static assets and serves from the `baseUrl` (or domain).
   :::info
   For web-hosted images, do not use the `useBaseUrl` syntax.
   * &#9989; Do: `<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Jira-OpenTelemetry/Jira-Catalina.png' alt="Catalina" />`
   * &#10060; Don't: `<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Jira-OpenTelemetry/Jira-Catalina.png')} alt="Catalina" />`   
   :::
1. Add alt text, which provides a brief description of an image, ensuring accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or have slow internet connections. It also complies with US Government GSA Section 508 regulations. Here are some best practices:
   - **Be concise and specific**. Describe the core purpose of the image (e.g., `alt="Screenshot showing the image properties dialog box"` or `alt="Sumo Logic logo"`).
   - **Focus on function**. Convey the image's key message without unnecessary details.
   - **Skip decorative images**. Use an empty alt attribute (`alt=""`) for images that are purely decorative.
   - **Check for missing alt text**. Always ensure that every image has appropriate alt text. If you encounter an image without it, add it.
1. Use the `width` to resize oversized and/or pixelated images, if needed.

    className="unique-tabs"
    defaultValue="Markdown"
    values={[
      {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
      {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
    ]}>

  <TabItem value="Markdown">

  ```md
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sumo-square.png')} alt="Sumo Logic thumbnail logo" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="150"/>
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Result">

  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/sumo-square.png')} alt="Sumo Logic thumbnail logo" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="150"/>

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

### Image sizes

When sizing images, use your discretion.

#### Logos

For square logos, set the width to about 45-55px.

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| <img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/logo-yes.png')} alt="Screenshot showing correctly sized logo" width="400"/> | <img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/logo-no.png')} alt="Screenshot showing oversized logo" width="440"/> |

For wide logos (like [in this doc](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/iis-7/)), set the width to about 90-120px.

#### Screenshots

Ensure that screenshots are large enough so that the content is legible, but not comically oversized. Use your discretion.

| &#9989; **Do** | &#10060; **Don't** |
|:---------------|:-------------------|
| <img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/screenshot-yes.png')} alt="alt-text" width="400"/> | <img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/screenshot-no.png')} alt="alt-text" width="400"/> |

Screenshots should never be wider than 600px.

### Images in lists

When adding an image to a bulleted or sequential list, include the image snippet in-line with the list item, with a `<br/>` element in between, like this:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```md
1. Here is a dinosaur.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/docusaurus.png')} alt="alt-text" width="100"/>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

1. Here is a dinosaur. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/docusaurus.png')} alt="alt-text" width="100"/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Screenshots

Capture screenshots using SnagIt in .png format. Use SnagIt's border effect to apply a gray (RGB 212, 212, 212) four-point border.

By default, images that you insert into a page are set to be responsive - resized for the type of device the reader is using.


### Masking sensitive information

We mask sensitive information like usernames, email addresses, and IP addresses. In Snagit or a similar program, use the shape tool to mask the text using solid gray, (RGB 212, 212, 212).

### Callouts

Create callouts using the shape tool in SnagIt. Callouts should be red, 100% opacity, no drop shadow effect, 2 pts wide.


## Lists

You can mix ordered (or numbered) and unordered (or bulleted) lists together. Use extra lines and tabs (or 2 spaces) to move content under these bullets, including other bullets, paragraphs, images, and more. Be careful of indenting too much; three tab indents will automatically render as code.

In a list item made up of an introductory word or phrase and an explanatory sentence or paragraph, separate the introductory text and the explanation with a period (`.`) rather than a dash (`-`). For example:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```md
1. **Entity**. Select the Entity field in the Record that the resulting Signal should be associated with.
1. **Description (Optional)**. Define the description for the Signal.
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

1. **Entity**. Select the Entity field in the Record that the resulting Signal should be associated with.
1. **Description (Optional)**. Define the description for the Signal.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Numbered lists

Use numbered lists when providing a set of instructions or steps.

Always start with `1.`. Markdown automatically numbers sequentially when building the site. This can be helpful when you need to add or change the order of instructions (no need to edit every number).

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```markdown title="Markdown Ordered List"
1. First ordered list item.
1. Another item.
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers do not matter, just that it is a number.
   1. Ordered sub-list.
1. And another item.

  More content for this entry. And a screenshot:<br/> ![span hover](/img/apm/traces/span-hover-view.png)

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

1. First ordered list item.
1. Another item.
   * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers do not matter, just that it is a number.
   1. Ordered sub-list.
1. And another item.
   * More content for this entry. And a screenshot:<br/> ![span hover](/img/apm/traces/span-hover-view.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Bulleted lists

Use bulleted lists when the items do not need to be presented in sequential order. End each bullet in a terminal period. Use asterisks `*` for unordered, bulleted lists.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```markdown title="Markdown Unordered List"
* Unordered list line 1.
* Line 2.
   <br/>Content to show under 2.
* Another set of bullets.
* Here we go, another!
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

* Unordered list line 1.
* Line 2.
   <br/>Content to show under 2.
* Another set of bullets.
* Here we go, another!

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can configure your editor to always use this format for lists. For Visual Studio Code, configure the following settings:

* **Ordered List: Marker** set to *one*.
* **Unordered List: Marker** set to *.

Ensure parallel grammatical structure - that is, start each bullet with the same part of speech.


## Links

When linking to Sumo Logic docs, use relative file paths. For external links, use absolute URL paths.

Whenever possible, use link text that’s relevant - such as the page title - rather than just "click here". If the link title is too long, you can either edit the title or summarize the content in a few words.

When linking to other Sumo Logic documentation, use the phrase "Learn more" on its own or after the end of a sentence.

## Markdown

Markdown is a simple, text-based format you can write using text editors, IDEs, or the GitHub website to write content. We use Docusaurus to manage, style, and build our site. We use GitHub-flavored Markdown, with some additional options. You can find more info at:
* [Docusaurus | Markdown Features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features)
* [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
* [GitHub | Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

### File naming convention

A Markdown file has a filename and extension of .md. We recommend keeping the filename short. It does not affect the canonical link.

## MDX

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) can make your documentation more **interactive** and allows using any **React components inside Markdown**:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`);
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !

## Measurements

For storage and memory sizes (MB, GB), the unit of measurement should be uppercase. For dimensions and weights, the unit of measurement should be lowercase (cm, lb). Do not separate the number and the unit with a space.

## Metadata (frontmatter)

Markdown documents contain a YAML block of metadata at the top called [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). This block includes elements such as the title, description, and search keywords. Every page should have an `id` for sidebar navigation.

Here is an example of a frontmatter block with sample text:

```
---
id: page
title: Page title
sidebar_label: Sidebar navigation title
description: Description about this feature.
keywords:
    - metrics
    - traces
tags: [metrics, traces]  
---
```

| Parameter | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `id:` | **(Required)** Unique identifier for the page, used in the sidebar and as the canonical link. Keep it short and only use dashes. |
| `slug:` | (Optional) Overrides the `id:` for the canonical link. Best used for index pages for sections. |
| `title:` | **(Required)** For SEO purposes, include main keywords in your title and keep it under 60 characters. This title is used in navigation if a `sidebar_label` is not included. |
| `sidebar_label:` | (Optional) Label for the sidebar navigation. Keep it title short. It does not affect the canonical link or page title. |
| `description:` | (Optional) 1-2 sentences describing the content in the doc. It appears in search engine results. If omitted, search engines will pull the first couple of sentences from the page. |
| `keywords:` | (Optional) List of keywords to enhance SEO. |
| `tags:` | (Optional) A string or list of tags that adds labels and permalinks to help with sorting. |

For a full list of options, see [Docusaurus Markdown front matter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter).



## Navigation menus

Top-level navigation content is controlled in our [`docusaurus.config.js`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config) file.

Our [`sidebars.ts`](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/blob/main/sidebars.ts) file controls the sidebar navigation for the entire site. It consists of multiple sidebars and sections based on the Guides top navigation, drilling down per guide. A list of sections and advice on content is at the top of the sidebars file, with comments throughout.

* To add a specific page, you include the directory path and topic id from the frontmatter. For example, this page is `contributing/style-guide`.
* To add a section within a section, use a category section with page links in it (see below example).
* To add an index for a section, create an index.md page in the folder. Give it a `slug: name` where the name is the folder for the entire section like contribution-guide. In the category, use a link line with the folder name and index for example: `link: {type: 'doc', id: 'contributing/index'},`.
* To add a new page, make note of the file path and id. For example, this document is located in the folder `contributing` with an id of `create-document`. When adding this file to the sidebar, it would be added to the `contributing/create-edit-doc`.
   <details>
   <summary>Example: add <code>contribution/create-document</code> to sidebars.ts</summary>

   ```js title="sidebars.ts"
   //Contribution guide for documentation
     contributing: [
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Contribution Guide',
         collapsible: true,
         collapsed: false,
         link: {type: 'doc', id: 'contributing/index'},
         items: [
           'contributing/create-edit-doc',
           'contributing/build-deploy',
           'contributing/translations',
           {
             type: 'category',
             label: 'Templates',
             collapsible: true,
             collapsed: false,
             items: [
               'contributing/templates/partner-app-doc'
             ]
           }
         ],
       },
     ],
   ```
   </details>
* To add a category, or dropdown list of documentation, use the following format:
   <details>
   <summary>Example: add sidebar category example with additional section</summary>

   ```js title="sidebars.ts"
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Name of Guide',
         collapsible: true,
         collapsed: false,
         link: {type: 'doc', id: 'foldername/id-first-page'},
         items: [
           'foldername/doc-id1',
           'foldername/doc-id2',
           {
             type: 'category',
             label: 'Section in Guide',
             collapsible: true,
             collapsed: false,
             link: {type: 'doc', id: 'foldername/id-section'},
             items: [
               'foldername/doc-id3',
               'foldername/doc-id4',
             ]
           }
         ],
       },
   ```
   </details>
* To add a dedicated sidebar, use the following format:
   <details>
   <summary>Example: adding a dedicated sidebar for a guide</summary>

   ```js title="sidebars.ts"
   module.exports = {
     sectionName: [
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Name of Guide',
         collapsible: true,
         collapsed: false,
         link: {type: 'doc', id: 'foldername/id-first-page'},
         items: [
           'foldername/doc-id1',
           'foldername/doc-id2',
           {
             type: 'category',
             label: 'Section in Guide',
             collapsible: true,
             collapsed: false,
             link: {type: 'doc', id: 'foldername/id-section'},
             items: [
               'foldername/doc-id3',
               'foldername/doc-id4',
             ]
           }
         ],
       },
       {
         type: 'category',
         label: 'Name of Another Guide',
         collapsible: true,
         collapsed: false,
         link: {type: 'doc', id: 'otherfoldername/id-first-page'},
         items: [
           'otherfoldername/doc-id1',
           'otherfoldername/doc-id2',
           {
             type: 'category',
             label: 'Section in Another Guide',
             collapsible: true,
             collapsed: false,
             link: {type: 'doc', id: 'otherfoldername/id-section'},
             items: [
               'otherfoldername/doc-id3',
               'otherfoldername/doc-id4',
             ]
           }
         ],
       },
     ]
   ```
   </details>

## Numbers

* Use numerals, rather than spelling the number out. For example, “2” instead of “two”.
* Use commas for numbers that are 4 or 5 digits in length, for example, 1,000 or 99,999.
* For numbers 100,000 and higher, use “K”, “M”, and “B” to indicate thousands, millions, or billions.
* Use an en-dash without a space on either side for number ranges.

## Patents and trademarks

Protecting our patents and trademarks is important to do correctly. We do not want to expose the company to a loss of trademark or patent just because we didn't list it correctly.

This is a partial list of trademarked terms, which should be capitalized exactly as shown below.

* Sumo Logic
* Big Data for Real Time IT
* Log Reduce
* Elastic Log Processing
* Push Analytics

Never use Sumo Logic in the plural or possessive form.


## Punctuation

Punctuation is placed outside of quotation marks, British English style. For everything else (dates, times, spelling), we use American English style.

### Colons
Colons are used to introduce lists or to separate titles from subtitles. Only include the colon if the introduction isn’t a complete sentence.

### Commas

We use the Oxford (serial) comma. For example, use "I had eggs, toast, and orange juice", not "[I had eggs, toast and orange juice](https://www.verbicidemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/why-i-still-use-the-oxford-comma.jpg)".

### Exclamation points

Use exclamation points to express excitement or encourage the user. Don't use them for errors, warnings, or confirmation of basic actions as they are usually unnecessary and can distract from important details.

### Ellipses and truncation

Use ellipses for truncation. Don’t use ellipses for placeholders or trailing off a sentence unless it is getting cut off. When truncating, think about which part of the string is most essential for the user. This may require truncating in the beginning, middle, or end of a string.

### Periods

In the UI, avoid periods for single sentences on their own. Whenever there are two or more sentences, use periods at the end of each sentence. Separate sentences by one space, not two.


## Release notes

Our release notes (also known as changelog) are posted to the both the docs site and corresponding RSS feed. Check out the categories [here](/docs/release-notes). Keep your them concise and add links to documentation. If there are updated UI elements, add an image or gif.

### Text only

To add a text-only release note:

1. In the appropriate blog folder ([blog-collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/blog-collector), [blog-cse](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/blog-cse), [blog-csoar](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/blog-csoar), [blog-developer](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/blog-developer), [blog-service](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/blog-service)), add a new file that follows the format of the other posts in that folder. For example, for blog-service release notes, the format is `YYYY-MM-DD-<product/feature>`. For Cloud SIEM and SOAR, the format is `YYYY-MM-DD-application-update` or `YYYY-MM-DD-content-update`.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/contributing/release-notes-dropdown-menu.png')} alt="Release notes menu" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="200"/>
1. Add the following frontmatter, swapping out these example values with your own. Because there's no `image`, we'll use the Sumo Logic logo in its place.
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: New XYZ Feature
    hide_table_of_contents: true
    keywords:
      - alerts
    image: https://help.sumologic.com/img/sumo-square.png
    authors:
      - url: https://help.sumologic.com/release-notes-service/rss.xml
        image_url: /img/release-notes/rss-orange.png
    ---
    ```
    * `title`. Title for release note that includes product or feature name.
       :::note
       For service release notes only, append the title with the category name in parenthesis (example: `Automatic Log Level Detection (Search)`). See previous service release notes for category names.
       :::
    * `keywords`. Add a brief bulleted list of major keywords.
    * `hide-table-of-contents`. Hide the TOC on the page, keeping the notes clean and wide on the page.
1. Document the release notes. Add links, bullets, and images as needed.

#### Long release notes

For lengthy release notes, we recommend introducing the notes and adding a truncate line (`<!--truncate-->`), followed by the full set of release notes.

### Text and images

To add release notes with images:

1. In the blog folder, create a new folder with the following name format: `YYYY-MM-DD-product`.
1. In the new folder, create a markdown file named `index.md`.
1. Add your release notes with frontmatter:
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: New XYZ Feature
    hide_table_of_contents: true
    keywords:
      - alerts
    image: https://help.sumologic.com/img/sumo-square.png
    authors:
      - url: https://help.sumologic.com/release-notes-service/rss.xml
        image_url: /img/release-notes/rss-orange.png
    ---
    ```
1. Save the image to this folder and add them to the markdown file: `![alt text](image-name.png)`.


## Reusing content

For repeatable content - an identical section that appears in one or more docs - you can save a lot of time by creating one instance of that content in the `/docs/reuse` folder and then importing that snippet to other docs.

1. Create a new markdown file and save it to the [`/docs/reuse`](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/tree/main/docs/reuse) folder.
1. Import that content to another doc by adding this snippet (substitute the file path and object name with your own).
   ```bash
   import RestartC2C from '../reuse/restart-c2c-source.md';

   <RestartC2C/>
   ```

Headings in the reuse folder will not appear in the right-side nav in docs where they're imported. For this reason, unless the headers are H4 or below, reuse the content only but retain headings in the other docs.

Example: the content under the Cloud-to-Cloud source docs > Restarting Your Source section ([example](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/1password-source/#restarting-your-source)) lives in the `reuse` folder. The H3 headers live in the actual docs, and H4 headers live in [the `reuse` file](/docs/reuse/restart-c2c-source):

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```md
### Restarting your source

import RestartC2C from '../reuse/restart-c2c-source.md';

<RestartC2C/>

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Result">

### Restarting your source

import RestartC2C from '../reuse/restart-c2c-source.md';

<RestartC2C/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tables
Simple tables can help format content. For example, lists of attributes with descriptions. Adding the style below the table helps with formatting.

Tables use plain markdown with one header, default left-aligned columns, and multi-colored rows. You can use Markdown for links and images. To break up content, you can use `<br/>` for line breaks.

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Markdown"
  values={[
    {label: 'Markdown', value: 'Markdown'},
    {label: 'Result', value: 'Result'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Markdown">

```
| Column Name | Example Value | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Trace ID | ffaf2f69ee8ad0c1 | The unique identifier of the trace. |
| Root Service | api | The service that started the trace. |
| Started At | 07/27/2020 09:01:04.533 | When the trace started. |
| Duration | 12.582 ms | The amount of time the trace spans.  |

```


```
Colons can be used to align columns.

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you do not need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Docusaurus also supports HTML tables.


## Tabs

Use the following code to create tabbed content. You can use Markdown in these tabs, including text, code content, images, and more.

At the bottom of the Markdown file, add the following code:

```md title="Copy and paste once into markdown file"
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

For each set of tabs, use the following code:

```md title="Copy and paste into markdown for each tab set"
<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Tab 1', value: 'tab1'},
    {label: 'Tab 2', value: 'tab2'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="tab1">

Add content here for first tab.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tab2">

Add content here for second tab.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

See the following tabbed code examples:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="kinesis"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kinsesis Firehose', value: 'kinesis'},
    {label: 'Lambda', value: 'lambda'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="kinesis">

Set up a Source in Sumo Logic:

1. Navigate to Collection management.
1. Use an existing Hosted Collector, or create a new one.
1. Next to the collector, select **Add Source**.
1. Select **AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs**.
1. Enter a **Name** to identify the source.
1. Enter a **Source Category** following the best practices found in “Good Source Category, Bad Source Category”.

Deploy the Cloudformation Template to Create a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream:

1. Download the Cloudformation template.
1. Open CloudFormation in AWS.
1. Create a new stack using the CloudFormation template you downloaded.
1. Provide the URL you created from your Sumo source.
1. Select an S3 bucket to deliver failed logs, or create a new one.
1. Click **Next**.

Accept the IAM permissions, and create the stack.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lambda">

Info for the second tab would go here! Content can include markdown, code blocks, notes, and more.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## SEO

For clarity and search engine discoverability:

* Doc titles are very important for SEO. Use primary target keywords, try to mention "Sumo Logic", and keep length under 60 characters.
   * Example: ~~_Monitoring with the Observability Solution_~~ &rarr; _Monitoring with Sumo Logic Observability_
* Use H2 sections to break up content and try to use primary keywords here as well.
   * Example: _AWS Observability Solution_.
* H3 and H4 headers do not impact SEO as much. Use short, meaningful titles for readability and search.
   * Example: _System architecture and monitoring_.

:::sumo For internal contributors
* If you change a URL, set up a [redirect](/docs/contributing/remove-doc#step-1-create-a-301-redirect) so that users don’t get a 404 page.
* Use Google Analytics to make data-driven decisions.

## UI elements

Not all UI elements have an intuitive name. It's the very nature of working with a constantly evolving product. Here are some examples:

import UiElements from '../reuse/ui-elements.md';

<UiElements/>

### Cascading instructions

When providing instructions that involve multiple UI elements, list them sequentially and in cascading order. For example: Click **More Actions** > **Delete**.

### Referring to locations in the UI

Avoid "below", "above", "next to", and so on, when referring to UI elements on a page, as locations may change or appear differently for different users.

### Mouse actions

Try to avoid these if possible. Instead, use "Select".

If you need to use mouse actions to be specific, use:
* "Click" (not "Click on" or "Left-click")
* "Right-click"
* "Hover" (not "Mouse over")
* "Drag"


### When to use “select”, “choose”, and “enter”

* **Select**. Use to tell users to pick something from a limited number of options, such as from a list or a dropdown menu, or when you are referring to checking or toggling a UI element.
* **Choose**. Use to encourage the user to make a decision that is more subjective or open-ended.
* **Enter**. Use enter when the user is explicitly inputting something from scratch, rather than from a pre-built set of options.


## Videos

To embed a YouTube video on a doc:

1. Copy and paste the following code into your page (including the `import Iframe` line).
   ```html
   <Iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/abcde12345?rel=0"
        width="854px"
        height="480px"
        id="myId"
        className="video-container"
        display="initial"
        position="relative"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay=1; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        />

   import Iframe from 'react-iframe';
   ```
1. Remove the URL ID from the snippet (`abcde12345`) and replace it with your own video ID, which you can find in the YouTube link URL.
1. Ensure that `?rel=0` is appended to the end of the URL. This ensures that only videos from the current YouTube channel will be suggested to the viewer after they've finished viewing the embedded video.
