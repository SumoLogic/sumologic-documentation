This feature is in Beta. To participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or [enroll here](https://forms.gle/LozrrAppM9FM94tS9).

Unstructured Logs Support for [Sumo Logic Copilot](/docs/search/copilot), our AI assistant, enables it to understand and provide insights from raw, text-based logs, even if they don't follow a structured format like JSON. This means you can ask questions in plain English and get meaningful results from nearly any log data, without requiring Field Extraction Rules (FERs).

## What's new

Currently, [Copilot works best on structured (JSON) logs](/docs/search/copilot/#compatible-log-formats). With this beta update, Copilot automatically applies parsing logic to unstructured logs, even if no FERs are configured. This allows Copilot to interpret logs from many popular data sources out-of-the-box and enables support for a broader range of log types.

Copilot learns from usage patterns; if a log source is already used in dashboards or commonly queried, it‚Äôs more likely to produce accurate, actionable results.

* **Broader coverage**. Copilot now parses and generates insights from unstructured log formats, even without FERs, making it useful for environments that include custom or inconsistent log types.
* **Improved usability**. Ask questions in natural language. Copilot interprets your intent and suggests relevant searches, even for raw, non-JSON logs.
* **Performance and reliability**. Response times and suggestion accuracy are consistent with Copilot‚Äôs structured log experience.
* **Security and compliance**. The same strict data handling and privacy standards apply. Unstructured Logs Support builds on Copilot‚Äôs secure foundation.

### Powered by Intelliparse mode

Behind the scenes, Copilot now uses [Intelliparse Mode](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/intelliparse) to automatically extract fields from unstructured logs. This new parsing engine discovers and applies parsing logic based on your existing dashboards‚Äîallowing Copilot to work with logs that don‚Äôt follow a consistent format.

You‚Äôll see more meaningful results from raw logs without needing to create Field Extraction Rules (FERs) or define parsing logic manually.

Copilot uses a hidden operator called `intelliparse`, which is automatically injected into queries when needed. You won't see it in the UI, but it‚Äôs what powers field extraction in unstructured logs.

Example, let‚Äôs say you ask Copilot: `Show me the top failed login attempts from nginx logs.`

If your nginx logs are unstructured, Copilot will:
1. Identify relevant parsers from your dashboards
2. Use the hidden `intelliparse` operator to apply those parsers
3. Extract fields like `status`, `username`, or `ip_address`
4. Return insights based on those parsed fields

### Common use cases

* **Keyword-based search**. Search for IP addresses, error codes, or other patterns without needing a predefined schema.  
* **Error triage**. Quickly identify the most common error messages in raw logs to speed up troubleshooting.  
* **Threat hunting**. Detect suspicious activity, failed logins, or unusual patterns in plain-text logs.
* **Smarter prioritization**. Frequently used data sources (such as those in dashboards or frequent queries) are prioritized for deeper insights.

## Tips and best practices

* Start with common natural language queries, like:
  - ‚ÄúShow failed login attempts for the past 24 hours‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúFind logs with IP 192.0.2.0‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat are the top 5 errors from nginx logs today?‚Äù
* Use dashboards to monitor your log sources. Copilot performs better when logs are part of existing queries and visualizations.
* Logs with consistent formats, clear timestamps, and standard separators (like commas or tabs) yield better results.

## Related updates

These recent Copilot enhancements make it even easier to work with unstructured logs:

* **Dynamic conversation titles**. Your queries are automatically titled for easy organization and retrieval.
* **"Open in Copilot" for alerts**. Investigate alerts directly in Copilot without losing context.
* **Suggestion pinning**. Pin suggestions inside a conversation to revisit them later.

## FAQ

**Does this replace Field Extraction Rules (FERs)?**<br/>
No. Copilot works with or without FERs. While FERs are useful for structured analysis, they're no longer required for Copilot to interpret unstructured logs.

**Will Copilot interpret all my logs?**<br/>
Copilot prioritizes data sources that are already used in dashboards or frequent queries. This improves the relevance of insights and helps focus on high-value logs.

**How is this different from structured log support?**<br/>  
Structured logs have predefined fields, allowing Copilot to map queries directly. For unstructured logs, Copilot uses AI and parsing techniques to infer structure on the fly.

<!--
**How is Copilot able to understand unstructured logs?**<br/>
Copilot uses a new parsing engine called [Intelliparse mode](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/intelliparse). It automatically extracts fields from raw logs using parsers discovered from your dashboards, so you don‚Äôt have to define parsing logic or FERs manually.
