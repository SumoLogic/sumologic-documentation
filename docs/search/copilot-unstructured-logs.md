Unstructured Logs Support for [Sumo Logic Copilot](/docs/search/copilot), our AI assistant, enables it to understand and provide insights from raw, text-based logs, even if they don't follow a structured format like JSON. This means you can ask questions in plain English and get meaningful results from nearly any log data, without requiring Field Extraction Rules (FERs).

## What's new

Currently, [Copilot works best on structured (JSON) logs](/docs/search/copilot/#compatible-log-formats). With this beta update, Copilot automatically applies parsing logic to unstructured logs, even if no FERs are configured. This allows Copilot to interpret logs from many popular data sources out-of-the-box and enables support for a broader range of log types.

Copilot learns from usage patterns; if a log source is already used in dashboards or commonly queried, it‚Äôs more likely to produce accurate, actionable results.

* **Broader coverage**. Copilot now parses and generates insights from unstructured log formats, even without FERs, making it useful for environments that include custom or inconsistent log types.
* **Improved usability**. Ask questions in natural language. Copilot interprets your intent and suggests relevant searches, even for raw, non-JSON logs.
* **Performance and reliability**. Response times and suggestion accuracy are consistent with Copilot‚Äôs structured log experience.
* **Security and compliance**. The same strict data handling and privacy standards apply. Unstructured Logs Support builds on Copilot‚Äôs secure foundation.
* **Common use cases**.
  * **Keyword-based search**. Search for IP addresses, error codes, or other patterns without needing a predefined schema.  
  * **Error triage**. Quickly identify the most common error messages in raw logs to speed up troubleshooting.  
  * **Threat hunting**. Detect suspicious activity, failed logins, or unusual patterns in plain-text logs.
* **Smarter prioritization**. Frequently used data sources (such as those in dashboards or frequent queries) are prioritized for deeper insights.

## Tips and best practices

* Start with common natural language queries, like:
  - ‚ÄúShow failed login attempts for the past 24 hours‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúFind logs with IP 192.0.2.0‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat are the top 5 errors from nginx logs today?‚Äù
* Use dashboards to monitor your log sources. Copilot performs better when logs are part of existing queries and visualizations.
* Logs with consistent formats, clear timestamps, and standard separators (like commas or tabs) yield better results.

## Related updates

These recent Copilot enhancements make it even easier to work with unstructured logs:

* **Dynamic conversation titles**. Your queries are automatically titled for easy organization and retrieval.
* **"Open in Copilot" for alerts**. Investigate alerts directly in Copilot without losing context.
* **Suggestion pinning**. Pin suggestions inside a conversation to revisit them later.

## FAQ

**Does this replace Field Extraction Rules (FERs)?**<br/>
No. Copilot works with or without FERs. While FERs are useful for structured analysis, they're no longer required for Copilot to interpret unstructured logs.

**Will Copilot interpret all my logs?**<br/>
Copilot prioritizes data sources that are already used in dashboards or frequent queries. This improves the relevance of insights and helps focus on high-value logs.

**How is this different from structured log support?**<br/>  
Structured logs have predefined fields, allowing Copilot to map queries directly. For unstructured logs, Copilot uses AI and parsing techniques to infer structure on the fly.


## Feedback and support

We‚Äôre actively looking for customers to participate in the beta and provide feedback. Ideal participants:

* Use dashboards for monitoring across most of their data sources  
* Have some hands-on experience with Copilot
* Are willing to provide detailed feedback during the beta
