# Run LogCompare

You can run a LogCompare operation using a timeshift that is preconfigured, or create a custom timeshift for your search. When you click the **LogCompare** button, the default is a 24-hour timeshift.

## Run a Preconfigured LogCompare

1. Enter a keyword to search for and press **enter** or select **Start**. For example: `error`

1. Select a time range for your search. For this example, we have used **Last Minute**.

1. When the **Messages** tab displays with the initial results, click **LogCompare** to run the query immediately or use the menu to select a different time shift.

1. The ` logcompare` operator and `timeshift -24h` are added to your query, for example: 

    ```sql
    error | logcompare timeshift -24h
    ```

1. Results appear in the **Signatures** tab.

## Run a Custom LogCompare

1. Enter a keyword to search for and press **enter** or select **Start**. For example:   
      
    ```sql
    _sourceCategory=stream
    ```

1. Select a time range. For this example, we have used **Last Minute**.
1. When the **Messages** tab displays with the initial results, click the arrow next to the **LogCompare** button, and from the menu select **Custom**.

1. In the **Custom LogCompare** dialog, you can edit:

    * **Baseline Query.** The original query.
    * **Time Shift.** This is the Time Shift of the Baseline Query, and it controls when the Baseline Query runs. If the Time Shift is -2d, that means that it will run for the exact Time Range duration (1 minute, in this query), but two days in the past. The Time Shift can take a single value, such as -2d, or it can take a range. It must be a valid range, with a start date older or smaller than the end date.
    * **Target Query.** Originally, the Target Query is the same as the Baseline Query. But you can edit it to compare against a new target. Here we have added `_sourceCategory=analysis` to compare it to`_sourceCategory=stream`.
    * **Time Range.** The Time Range pertains to both the Target Query and the Baseline Query. You can enter a preconfigured, relative, or absolute time range, similar to the time range on the Search page. The Time Range can be specified by timeshift (start_time = now - timeshift) or (start_time + end_time).

        * For the target, if the end_time is not specified, it is implicitly set to now if not specified.
        * For the baseline, if the end_time is not specified, it is implicitly set as: (end_time = start_time + range_length). The (range_length = end_time - start_time) using the target times.

1. Click **Run**.
1. The logcompare operator, timeshift, and baseline are added to your query, for example:   
      
    ```sql
    _sourceCategory=analysis | logcompare timeshift -2d baseline (_sourceCategory=stream)
    ```  
     
1. Results appear in the **Signatures** tab.

## Time Shift versus Time Range example

This example provides meaning to what a **Time Shift** is compared to a **Time Range** when configuring a custom LogCompare search.

Take the following query with a **Time Range** of `-1d` where today is November 10, 2018 (11/10/2018) and with a **Time Shift** of `-30d`:

```sql
_sourceCategory=prod/* "error: 400" | logcompare timeshift -30d
```

This query will run a current (target) search on the past day, 11/09/2018 to 11/10/2018, and also run a baseline (historical) search on 10/10/2018 to 10/11/2018, 30 days ago with a one day time range, to then compare the log signatures from each search.

A query like the following with a **Time Range** of `-30d` where today is November 10, 2018 (11/10/2018) and with a **Time Shift** of `-1d`:

```sql
_sourceCategory=prod/* "error: 400" | logcompare timeshift -1d
```

will run a current (target) search on the past 30 days, 10/11/2018 to 11/10/2018, and also run a baseline (historical) search on 10/10/2018 to 11/09/2018, one day shifted into the past with a 30 day time range, to then compare.
