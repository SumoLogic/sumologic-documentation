# LogCompare Syntax

The logcompare operator allows you to compare two sets of logs: baseline (historical) and target (current). To run a LogCompare operation, you can use the **LogCompare** button on the **Messages** tab to generate a properly formatted query.

The syntax of the LogCompare operator is described here. For examples of syntax, see [syntax](#logcompare-syntax).  

## Compare vs. LogCompare 

The [compare](../time-compare.md) and logcompare operators are very similar in syntax and functionality, but they handle different
types of data:

* **compare** is used for aggregated numeric data (for example, for analyzing results from a [group by](../search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators "Group") query or a query with aggregation operators such as count, sum, avg, etc. )
* **logcompare** is used for log signature counts (used right after the first pipe).

## LogCompare Syntax

* `... | logcompare timeshift -24h`  
    Compare the result of a query with the result of the same query for a time range shifted by 24 hours.  
     
* `... | logcompare timeshift -1d`  
    Compare the result of a query with the result of the same query for a time range shifted by 1 day. (Same as previous example.)  
     
* `... | logcompare start_time 2016-01-06T12:00:00-08:00 end_time 2016-01-07T12:00:00-08:00`  
    Compare the result of a query with the result of the same query for a time range specified by start_time and end_time.** **This must be a valid time range.   
     
* `_sourceHost=cluster-1| logcompare timeshift -0s baseline(_sourceHost=cluster-2)`  
    Compare logs on two different hosts (cluster-1 and cluster-2) for the same time period.

## New Hidden Fields

These fields are generated by the logcompare operator, and can be used in the following logcompare operator query string.

These fields are described in the following table:

| Field | Description|
| -- | -- |
| `_count` | The number of log messages that belong to this cluster for this query. |
| `_deltaPercentage` | The percent change of the signature, calculated as (targetPercentage - baselinePercentage) / baselinePercentage, where baselinePercentage is the number of logs matched to the signature divided by the total number of logs in the baseline, and similarly for targetPercentage. This is infinity for new signatures. |
| `_anomalyScore` | The value is calculated using a symmetric version of [Kullback-Leibler divergence score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence). |
| `_isNew` | Values are Boolean. 1 if the cluster is new, otherwise 0. |

## Using Hidden Fields

:::important
These options are not supported in the **LogCompare Custom** dialog. They are only supported in as part of the query in the search box.
:::

When you use the logcompare operator, new hidden fields are created that you can use to focus your results. Here's how you can use these fields.

**Show only signatures that are missing in the baseline query:**

For example, you can run the query:

```sql
error | logcompare timeshift -1d | where (_isNew)
```

The query results are constrained to new clusters only using
the `_isNew field`.

**Show only signatures that are missing in the target query:**

And in this example, the logcompare operator shows only clusters that no longer include any messages:

```sql
error | logcompare timeshift -1d | where _count ==0
```
