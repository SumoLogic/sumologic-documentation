description: Learn how to perform the search for the selected child org.

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can run a log search query in the selected child org under a parent org. All the results obtained from this search will have the data identified from the selected child org.

Follow the steps below to perform a child org-level search:

1. **New UI.** In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Logs** > **Log Search**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Log Search**.<br/>**Classic UI.** Go to the **Log Search** page.
1. Click the <img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/get-started-search/search-page/child-org-select-button.png')} alt="child-org-select-button" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="30"/>Â button to select the child org where you want to query. You can either select one child org or multiple chid orgs.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/get-started-search/search-page/child-org-dropdown.png')} alt="child-org-dropdown" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
1. Enter the required query and click the search button to obtain the search results.
    :::note
    Make sure you use an aggregator and `_orgID` for multi-child org queries. For example, `* | count by _orgId` or `* | count by _orgId | sum (_count)`.
    :::

There can be two possible errors while running the multi-child org queries:

- **Partial success**. This occurs when you run a query across all child orgs, and while some child orgs successfully execute, one or more encounter failures. Despite the failures, aggregate results from the successfully executed child orgs will be displayed. To resolve the failure, refer to the audit logs (`_index=sumologic_system_events`) for detailed information on the failure query.
- **Error**. This occurs when you run a query across all child orgs, and all child orgs encounter failures with no child orgs returning the successful result. To resolve the failure, refer to the audit logs (`_index=sumologic_system_events`) for detailed information on the failure query.

:::note
- All the searches that run via the child org in the parent org would be billed under the child org account.
- Audit logs for the completed searches would appear under the child org logs.
- Raw messages and facets are supported only for one child org query and not for multiple chid orgs query.
