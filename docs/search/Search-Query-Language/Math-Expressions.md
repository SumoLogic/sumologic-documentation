# Math Expressions

You can use general mathematical expressions on numerical data extracted
from log lines.Â 

### Syntax

-   `| expression [as\<fiel\>]`

### Rules

-   The term "expression" is evaluated as a mathematical expression in
    the context of existing fields.
-   Parentheses can be used to group operations.
-   The ternary operator is supported so you can use
    `"condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false"`.
-   Supported mathematical operators `+, -, *, /, %`

### Examples

-   Boolean expression tests like: `disk\> 0.8 ? 1 : 0 as overcapacity`
-   Math function calls like: `min((fps / 10 + 1) * 10, 70) as bucket`
-   Assuming x = 1, 2, thenÂ   
    `ceil(sqrt(x*x + y*y)) as d`  
    should result in d = 2.0

### Java's Math Class

Sumo Logic does not officially support all of Java's Math class
functions.Â 

The Sumo Logic Java library includes the Math class functions, though
they are not documented.

The followingÂ example usesÂ the pow() function:

    | 10 as number | pow(number, 10) as newnumber

To reference Java's Math class functions,
seeÂ\<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.htm\>.
