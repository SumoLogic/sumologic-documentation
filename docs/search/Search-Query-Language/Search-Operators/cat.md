# cat

You can use the `cat` operator to view the contents of a lookup table.Â 

The `cat` operator is not supported in live dashboards or scheduled
searches.

### Syntax

`cat path://â€\<path-to-tabl\>â€Â `

where:Â 

`path-to-table` is the path toÂ the lookup table in theÂ Sumo Logic
Library.

For example:Â 

`cat path://"/Library/Users/myusername@sumologic.com/Suspicious Users"`

To determine the path to a lookup table, highlight the row for the table
in the Sumo Logic Library, and select **Copy path to clipboard**Â from
the three-dot more options menu for the table.Â   
Â 

If your lookup table is very large, it may take a few minutes to
display.

You can export queryÂ results in the **Messages** tab of the search
results. Click the gear icon and select an export option.
