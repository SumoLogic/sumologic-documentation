# timeslice

The **timeslice** operator segregates data by time period, so you can
create bucketed results based on a fixed interval (for example,
five-minute buckets). Timeslice also supports creating a fixed-target
number of buckets, for example, 150 buckets over the last 60 minutes.

There are two primary use cases for this operator:

1.  Group data into time-sliced buckets for aggregation analysis
2.  Group data into time-sliced buckets for time-series visual analysis

Letâ€™s say you log each time a user successfully logs into your service,
and you want to track how many logins per hour, on a daily basis. You
can use the timeslice operator to group the data into one-hour segments,
and view the data over a 24 hour period.

### SyntaxÂ 

-   `timesliceÂ\<#\<time_perio\>Â [as\<fiel\>] |\<aggregating_operato\> by\<fiel\>Â `
-   `timeslice\<\> buckets [as\<fiel\>] |\<aggregating_operato\> by\<fiel\>`

Supported \<time_perio\>` values are weeks (Â `w`Â ), daysÂ (Â `d`Â ), hours
(Â `h`Â ), minutes (Â `m`Â ), and secondsÂ (Â `s`Â ).

To group data by (M) month you can use the formatDate operator to format
\_timesliceÂ to a month format, like this:

`timeslice 1d | formatDate(_timeslice,"MM-01-yyyy") as month | parseDate(month,"MM-dd-yyyy") as _timesliceÂ  |\<aggregating_operato\> by _timesliceÂ `

### Rules

-   An alias for the timeslice field is optional. If an alias is not
    provided, aÂ default `_timeslice`Â field is created that marks the
    start of the timeslice in milliseconds.
-   Creates a field named `__timeslice_end` that marks the end of the
    timeslice in milliseconds.
-   The timeslice operator is commonly used in conjunction with the
    transpose operator. After youâ€™ve timesliced the data into buckets,
    the transpose operator allows you to plot aggregated data in a time
    series.
-   The timeslice operator must be used with an aggregating operator
    such asÂ **count by**Â orÂ **group by**.
-   The number of buckets in your query is a target or maximum, not
    necessarily the exact number of buckets that will be returned. For
    example, if your query specifies 150 buckets, Sumo Logic will find a
    reasonable clock-aligned resolution to return approximately 150
    buckets in the query results.
-   If you use timeslice with the compare or outlier operators, **do
    not** alias timeslice. They expectÂ \_timeslice.

### Example

Successful logins per hour.

`Â  Â  Â _sourceCategory=exampleApplication* Â Â Â Â | parse "login_status=*"Â as login_status Â Â Â Â | where login_status="success" Â Â Â Â | timeslice 1h Â Â Â Â | count by _timeslice`

### Known Issue

There is a known issue with theÂ timesliceÂ operatorÂ andÂ Daylight Savings
Time (DST). When the clock moves forward, any timesliceÂ operationÂ that
crosses the DST boundary is affected. For this reason,Â resultsÂ may show
more than one entry for that day.Â 

For example,Â in Australia, DSTÂ goes into effect on October 2nd for
Spring. For that day, with a 1d timeslice, youÂ would seeÂ two entries for
the same day: one for 12Â a.m. and another for 11Â p.m.

In another example,Â if youÂ had a 4hÂ timeslice, you would usually see
results at 12Â a.m., 4Â a.m., 8Â a.m., 12Â p.m., etc. But when the DST
happens, the result after 12Â a.m. could be either 3Â a.m.Â or 5Â a.m.,
depending on Fall or Spring.Â 

## Timeslice Operator Examples

### Basic examples

**TimesliceÂ 5m**Â   
Fixed-size buckets at 5 minutes. The output field isÂ **default
\_timeslice**.

**TimesliceÂ 2h as 2hrs**Â   
Fixed-size buckets that are 2 hours long. The output field name is
aliased toÂ **2hrs**.

**Timeslice 150 buckets**Â   
Bucketing to 150 buckets over the search results.

**TimesliceÂ 1m as my_time_bucket_field_name**Â   
Fixed-size buckets of 1 minute each. The output field name is aliased
toÂ **my_time_bucket_field_name**.

### Examples in queries

`* | timesliceÂ 5m | count by _timesliceÂ `  
This outputs a table in the Aggregates tab with
columnsÂ **\_count**Â andÂ **\_timeslice**Â with the timeslices spaced in 5
minute intervals.

`* | timesliceÂ 5m as my_field_name_alias | count by _sourceCategory, my_field_name_aliasÂ `  
This outputs three columns:Â **\_count**,Â **\_sourceCategory**,
andÂ **my_field_name_alias**.

`* | timeslice 10 buckets | count by _sourceCategory, _timesliceÂ `  
This outputs a table in the Aggregates tab with
columnsÂ **\_count**,Â **\_sourceCategory**, andÂ **\_timeslice**Â with 10
rows for eachÂ **\_sourceCategory**Â in that table if you have messages
covering the entire search period.

### Additional Examples

**ExampleÂ 1:**Â Checking the server distribution over time to make sure
the load balancer is working properly.

`_sourceCategory=Apache/AccessÂ  | timeslice 1hÂ  | parse regex "(\<ip_addres\>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})" | count _timeslice, ip_addressÂ  | transpose row _timeslice column ip_address`

This query produces these results in the Aggregates tab, which you can
display as a column chart.

**Example 2:**Â All computer access to Sumo Logic over time.

`_sourceCategory=*IIS* | parse "* * * * * * * * "Â as date, time, csmethod, cs_uri_stem, cs_uri_query, s_port, s_ip, cs_useragent | timeslice 1mÂ  | count by _timeslice, s_ip | transpose row _timeslice column s_ip`

This query produces these results in the Aggregates tab, which you can
display as a stacked column chart:

**Example 3:**Â Monitoring non-normal status codes (400s and 500s) on
Apache servers.

`_sourceCategory=Apache/Access | parse "HTTP/1.1\" * " as status_code | where status_code\>= 400 | timeslice 5m | count as count by _timeslice,_sourceHost | transpose row _timeslice column _sourceHost`

This query produces these results in the Aggregates tab, which you can
display as an area chart:
