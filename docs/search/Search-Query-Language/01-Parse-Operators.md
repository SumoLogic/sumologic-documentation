# Parse Operators

Parse operators allow you to extract fields from log messages within a
query manually and on an ad-hoc basis.

For best practices use Parse operators to build [Field Extraction
Rules](../../Manage/Field-Extractions.md "Manage Field Extractions") to
automatically extract field values and use them to extend your query.

Before reading about our parse operators review our [documentation
styles](../../01Start-Here/03About-Sumo-Logic/Help_Documentation_Styles.md "Help Documentation Styles").
