# Transaction Operator

No matter what type of data you're analyzing, from tracking website sign
ups, to e-commerce data, to watching system activity across a
distributed system, the transaction operator can be used in a variety of
use cases. Ultimately, data is always ordered, at least by timestamp.
But during analysis, the transaction operator can process otherwise
unordered data and produce results using ordered data (data that has an
ordered flow).

For example, if you operated a retail website, you could use the
transaction operator to track your customer's movements through the log
events that determine the states of their transaction, such as login,
cart, payment, and checkout. From the results of your query, you could
visualize your customers as they move or "flow" through the site as
aÂ [Flow Diagram](Transaction-Operator/Flow_Diagrams.md "Flow Diagrams"),
and identify any problems, such as a drop-off at the payment state,
which prevents them from completing their purchase.

The transaction operator requires:

-   **One or more transaction IDs to group related log messages
    together.**Â You could use session IDs, IPs, username, email, or any
    other unique IDs that are relevant to your query. You'll define
    transaction IDs in a query. The transaction IDs are extracted using
    operators such
    asÂ [parse](../01-Parse-Operators/01-Parse-Predictable-Patterns-Using-an-Anchor.md "Parse Operator"),Â [parse
    regex](../01-Parse-Operators/02-Parse-Variable-Patterns-Using-Regex.md "Parse Variable Patterns Using Regex"),
    etc.
-   **Mapping from a log message to a state.**Â Specify the mapping from
    a log message to a state through the syntax of
    theÂ [matches](../Search-Operators/matches.md "matches")Â operator, or
    through fields that are already parsed.

## Syntax

-   `transaction on\<field\> [,\<field\>]...Â [fringe\<timespe\>] withÂ\<state\>Â results by [transactions | states | flow]Â `

States act as matching statements, searching your log for that specific
state. These support wildcardsÂ ` *`Â to match on any characters. For
example, in the following log, if one of the states you needed to
capture was when a session is started based on your parsed
fieldÂ sessionId,

`2018-02-15 13:00:28,799 -0800 INFO Â [hostId=nite-spark-app-1] [module=sumo-app] [localUserName=sumo-app] [logger=sumo.app.SumoAppSearchSessionProtocolHandler] [thread=DTP-soa.sumo-app-soa.SearchSessionProtocol-32] [auth=Customer:0000000000000111:0000000000000111:0000000000000111:false:DefaultSumoSystemUser:-1:UNKNOWN] [sessionId=B6C329D84D1E37C6] [customer=0000000000000111] [remotemodule=sumo-app] Starting session B6C329D84D1E37C6`

you would specify the state as a matching statement on the sessionId
like this:

`| transaction on sessionid with "* Starting session *" as init`

## Defining states

Think of states as a way of using log events and fields in your logs to
plot the movement of data. The transaction operator needs to have these
states defined to produce results. There are two ways you can define
states.

|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax for \<states\>**                                                      | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `\<match strin\>" [in\<fieldNam\>] as\<stateNam\>`                            | `with "*LinkAccountAction category=Google*" as linkGoogle,             with "*LinkAccountAction category=Facebook*" as linkFacebook,             with "*LinkAccountAction category=LinkedIn*" as linkLinkedIn,             with "*LinkAccountAction category=Other*" as linkOther` |
| `states\<state\> [as\<alias\>] [\<state\> [as\<alias\>]]...Â [in\<fieldNam\>]` | `with states login, cart, checkout, shipping, shipping_method, billing,Â %"Labs/Apache/Access"`                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The state is the text in the field.

Once states have been defined for ordered data, you can use them to
order data using the fromstate and tostate arguments, described in the
next section.

## Ordered vs Unordered data

When used with ordered data, you can monitor the transition between two
distinct states, allowing you to build a Flow Diagram to visually
represent the transitions a transaction goes through, and the number of
transactions between transitions. On unordered data, you can use the
transaction operator to build a table of results.

The difference between ordered and unordered data is the flow (order)
that you define in a transaction query. Both types of data require you
to define states. Ordered data is returned when specifying
`results by flow` by referring to the latency between states. There will
be a `latency` field generated by the operator that provides the
milliseconds between states.Â 

Below you'll see two nearly identical queries. On the left, unordered
data is searched, and the results are displayed in a table. On the
right, by addingÂ **results by flow**Â as well as counting the max latency
between eachÂ **fromstate**Â and **tostate**, we can build aÂ [Flow
Diagram](Transaction-Operator/Flow_Diagrams.md "Flow Diagrams").

[TABLE]

##### Loop back

**Loop backs** in the flow (order) of states are tracked and displayed
as red lines looping over the respective statesÂ in the flow diagram. You
can hover over the loops to view the number of occurrencesÂ respective
states had returned to a previous state.

## Specifying a fringe cut-off

Since transaction operator queries are constrained by a time window,
some transactions may be cut off if they occur near the edges of the
time window. It is possible to filter them out using the fringe
argument.

IfÂ *tw*Â is the time window for a query, then transactions that satisfy
the following will be filtered out:

-   ends in \[tw.start, tw.start + fringe)
-   starts in (tw.end - fringe, tw.end\]

**For example:**

`... | transaction on sessionid fringe=10mÂ  with "Starting session *" as init,Â  with "Initiating countdown *" as countdown_start,Â  with "Countdown reached *" as countdown_done,Â  with "Launch *" as launchÂ  results by transactions`

## Limitations

For ordered data, there is a group limit of 10,000. The transaction
operator uses a least recently used scheme to phase out transactions. So
when this limitation is reached, the transactions that are included in
the results are not the first 10,000 transactions, but the 10,000
most-frequently used transactions. This is due to the fact that some
earlier transactions have ended prematurely, as stated in the following
error.

This message is displayed if you use more than 10,000 groups with the
Transaction operator:

`Group or memory limit exceeded, some transactions may have ended prematurely.`

For unordered data, once group limit of 10,000 is reached, new
transactions are ignored.

## Transaction Examples

The following examples can help you understand the way transaction
works.

### Running transaction on sessionID

When you use the transaction operator, it requires one or more
transaction IDs to group related log messages together. For this ID, you
can use session IDs, IPs, username, email, or any other unique IDs that
are relevant to your query.

In this example, using the browser sessionID as the transaction ID, we
could define states for countdown_start and countdown_done:

`... | transaction on sessionid with "Starting session *" as init, with "Initiating countdown *" as countdown_start, with "Countdown reached *" as countdown_done, with "Launch *" as launch results by transactions showing max(_messagetime), sum("1") for init as initcount`

### Use fields created by transaction

There are two fields created by the transaction operator,Â  `_start_time`
and `_end_time`. These fields show up as Start Time and End Time on the
Aggregates tab, but you must reference them in queries using the names
with underscores or we won't recognize them.

The fields are assigned a timestamp in milliseconds.

For example in the query:

`_source=Syslog (New session) OR (Session deleted)Â  | transaction on sessionid with "*New session*" as started, with "*Session deleted*" as ended | where started\> 0Â  | ((_end_time - _start_time)/1000)/60 as time_difference_minutes`

You reference the `_end_time` and `_start_time` fields to calculate the
duration of theÂ `sessionid`.

transaction.png](../../static/img/Search-Query-Language/Transaction-Analytics/Transaction-Operator/fields%20created%20by%20transaction.png)

### Detecting a potential e-commerce failure

In this example, you could track the states of your e-commerce site to
see if there is a disconnect or drop off between two states that would
indicate a potential failure.

Running a query similar to:

`_sourceCategory=[sourceCategoryName] | parse regex "(\<i\>[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3})" nodrop | transaction on ip with "*/cart*" as cart, with "*/shippingInfo*" as shipping, with "*/billingInfo*" as billing, with "*Verifying credit card with external service*" as billingVerification, with "*/confirmation*" as confirmation, with "*Order shipped*" as ordershipped results by flow | count by fromstate, tostate`

could produce a Flow Diagram with normal drop-off rates at the different
states: cart, shipping, billing, billingVerification, confirmation, and
order shipped.

Now, if you ran this query and saw results as shown below, where there
is a big drop-off at the verification state, you could determine that
there is likely a problem with the verification service and start an
investigation.
