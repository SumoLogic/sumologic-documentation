# Merge Operator

The Merge operator reduces a stream of events to a single event using a
specified merge strategy. It is particularly useful as a subquery for
the
[Transactionize](Transactionize-operator.md "Transactionize operator")
operator. Each field can have a different merge strategy:

-   takeDistinct -Â summarize the field using only distinct values
-   takeFirst - summarize the field using the earliest value
-   takeLast - summarize the field using the latest value
-   join with *separator* - reduce the field by combining all values
    into a single string with the specified separator between each
    value. If no separator is specified a new line is used.

### Syntax

-   `merge`  
    Merge
    [\_raw](../../Get-Started-with-Search/Search-Basics/Built-in-Metadata.md "Search Metadata")
    values andÂ separateÂ themÂ with newlines. Adds a Time field containing
    the earliest timestamp.
-   `merge\<fiel\>`Â   
    Merge values of the named field and separate them with newlines.
-   `merge\<fiel\>Â \<strateg\>] [as\<fiel\>]`  
    Merge values of the named field using the specified strategy and
    specify a new name for the field.
-   `mergeÂ\<fiel\> \<strateg\>] [as\<field\>] [\<fiel\> \<strateg\>] [as\<field\>] ]...`Â   
    Merge a comma-delimited list of fields with separate merge
    strategies. When no strategy is specified, join with new lines is
    implied.

### Limitation

-   The
    [metadata](../../Get-Started-with-Search/Search-Basics/Built-in-Metadata.md "Search Metadata")
    field \_messageTimeÂ can only use strategies takeFirst and takeLast.

### Examples

The following query:

`* Â | parse "BytesSentPersec = \"*\"" as BytesPersecÂ  | merge BytesPersec join with "--", _messageTime takeLast`

produces a result something like this:

A common case for using the merge operator with the
[Transactionize](Transactionize-operator.md "Transactionize Operator")
operatorÂ is when all log messagesÂ have a common field, such
asÂ **transaction_id** or **request_id**. Using the merge operator
withÂ transactionize merges all the messages with the common fields, for
example:

`_sourceCategory=travelweb | parse regex "(\<i\>[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]) - " | transactionize ip (merge ip takeFirst, _raw join with "\n\n\n")Â `

Which provides results like the following. Notice that all the logs from
the same IPÂ are now grouped in one record.
