# Live Tail Show in Search

Just as you can start a Live Tail session from the Search page, you can
also start a search from the Live Tail page.

**Start a search from Live Tail:**

1.  On the **Live Tail** page, in the search box, enter a valid query
    with filters, if desired.
2.  From the menu, select **Show in Search**.
