title: LogReduce Operator
description: The LogReduce Operator allows you to quickly assess activity patterns for things like a range of devices or traffic on a website.
---

:::important
The summarize operator has been renamed the LogReduce operator, to match the **LogReduce** button on the **Messages** tab. Both operators will continue to work in search queries as synonyms for a limited time. We recommend that you rewrite saved queries replacing summarize with logreduce.
:::

The LogReduce&reg; algorithm uses fuzzy logic to group messages together based on string and pattern similarity. You can use the logreduce operator to quickly assess activity patterns for things like a range of devices or traffic on a website. Focus the LogReduce algorithm on an area of interest by defining that area in the keyword expression.

There are two ways to use the operator.

* Use the **LogReduce** [button](#logreduce-button) displayed on the results table after running a search.
* Manually add the operator to your query following its [syntax](#syntax).

For information on how to interpret and influence the outcome of LogReduce results, see [Detecting Patterns with LogReduce](detect-patterns-with-logreduce.md) and [Influencing the LogReduce Outcome](influence-the-logreduce-outcome.md).

### LogReduce button

When you've already run a search query with non-aggregate results, you can use the **LogReduce** button in the **Messages** tab to automatically apply the LogReduce operator to the current results.

1. Run a search query with non-aggregate results.
1. In the **Messages** tab, the **LogReduce** button displays. Click it to automatically apply the LogReduce operator to your results.

1. The **Signatures** tab is displayed with your results. 

### Rules

* The logreduce operator can't be used with [group-by operators](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators) such as "count by field".

### Syntax

`... | logreduce [field<field>] [by<byField>] [limit<limit>] [, criteria<criteria>]`

| Parameter | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `field` | The field to group by similarity. If no field is provided the raw message is used. |
| `byField` | Field to group signatures by. Results are returned aggregated. |
| `limit` | Limits the number of signatures returned. The total number of signatures involved in a search query can be overwhelming, making final results hard to digest and comprehend. Use this parameter to limit the number of returned signatures. |
| `criteria` | By default, LogReduce tries to find the most anomalous signatures. The criteria parameter can override the default criteria to either of the following values:<ul><li>`mostcommon`: Signatures that appear most frequently, having the highest counts.</li><li>`leastcommon`: Signatures that appear least frequently, having the lowest counts.</li></ul> |

### Details option

Using the **details** option launches a new query adding a unique signature ID that allows you to view the logs grouped under that signature. The signature ID is not available to run this manually, you will need to use the web interface.

After running a LogReduce operation, from the **Signatures** tab, you can view logs grouped together in a signature. To see the raw log data from signatures the operator provides the **details** option. You can view details in two ways:

* Click the number in the **Count** column for a signature.
* Check the checkboxes in the **Select** column for any number of signatures and click the **View Details** button on the top right of the table.

Details option syntax:

<code>... | logreduce | details &lt;signatureId&gt;</code><br/>

:::important
Once a LogReduce query has run with the details operator, you can't use that query again, for example, in a separate Search tab.

### Optimize option

LogReduce Optimize is a scaled-out version of LogReduce that groups logs by existing signatures. You need to prerun LogReduce on new data sources to create its signatures. In many cases, the optimized version provides up to 10x speedup over classic LogReduce on datasets with hundreds of thousands of logs. The only caveat with the optimized version is that some LogReduce classic features are not supported. The table below compares classic LogReduce with its optimized version based on available features and performance:

| Features | LogReduce | LogReduce Optimize |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Throughput |   | \~10x logreduce |
| Groups logs by existing signatures | Yes | Yes |
| Creates new signatures at runtime | Yes | No |
| Displays signature relevance | Yes | No |
| Allows interactive feedback (favoriting, disliking, editing, splitting, merging) | Yes | No |
| Supports details investigation | Yes | Yes |

Optimize option syntax:

```sql
... | logreduce [field<field>] optimize
```

For example:

```sql
_sourceCategory=cloudtrail  
| logreduce optimize
```


```sql
_sourceCategory=kubernetes-audit
| json auto
| logreduce field=object optimize
```

### Examples

1. First optimization:

    ```sql
    _sourceCategory = "Labs/AWS/GuardDuty_V8"
    | json keys "resource", "partition", "region"
    | logreduce
    ```
     
1. Next LogReduce by region:

    ```sql
    _sourceCategory = "Labs/AWS/GuardDuty_V8"
    | json keys "resource", "partition", "region"
    | logreduce(partition) by region limit=5,criteria=mostcommon
    ```
     
1. The LogReduce operator can act as an aggregate operator, supporting grouping by `_timeslice` as well as by other dimensions, such as `_sourceHost`.  

    ```sql
    ...     | logreduce by _sourceHost
    ```

    By grouping by `timeslice`, you can determine how signature counts
    change over a period of time.   

    ```sql
    ...     | timeslice 1m       | logreduce by _timeslice
    ```  

     
1. LogReduce by timeslice:

    ```sql
    _sourceCategory=MyApp
    | timeslice 1m
    | logreduce by _timeslice limit=5,criteria=mostcommon
    | transpose row _timeslice column signature
    ```

1. LogReduce by sourceHost:

    ```sql
    _sourceCategory=MyApp`  
    | logreduce by _sourceHost limit=5,criteria=mostcommon
    | transpose row _sourceHost column signature
    ```
