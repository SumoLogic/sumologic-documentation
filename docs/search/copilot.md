## How to use Copilot

In this section, you'll learn the recommended workflow for using Copilot effectively, along with best practices to maximize its benefits.

### Step 1: Open Copilot

To start using Copilot:

From the [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic), click the **Copilot** tab.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/classic-ui-tab.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="300" />

From the [**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui), click **Copilot** in the left nav.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/left-nav.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="300" />

### Step 2: Review and adjust the auto-selected source

Copilot automatically selects a source category based on its assessment of user intent. Review the selection and adjust it if needed. You can also manually enter a source expression to define the scope of your exploration.  

For example, to explore AWS WAF logs, select the appropriate source. For indexes, use `_index=<index name>`. Autocompletion is supported—start typing a few words to see source suggestions and choose one.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/source-category.png')} alt="Copilot source category" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />

### Step 3: Execute a query

#### Click a suggestion

Click on any of the prebuilt **Suggestions** prompts to launch your investigation. These AI-curated natural language insights are tailored to the specific source you've chosen.

In this example, we'll click `Count the number of log entries by the collector ID`. This translates the insight to a log query and renders results.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/suggestions.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />

#### Ask a question

In the **Ask Something...** field, you can manually enter a natural language prompt, similar to the prebuilt options under **Suggestions**. You can also use autocompletion—start typing a keyword to see relevant suggestions.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/manual-entry.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

#### Video: Autocomplete in action

<Iframe url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034043268?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"
     width="854px"
     height="480px"
     id="myId"
     className="video-container"
     display="initial"
     position="relative"
     allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
     allowfullscreen
     />

Broad questions may not yield accurate results. For best outcomes, frame your queries around a small, well-defined problem. If Copilot is unable to translate your prompt into a query, it will display "Failed translation".

Break your questions into smaller, specific requirements to help Copilot provide more accurate answers.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/periods-query-syntax.gif')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />

#### Tips and tricks

* **Start with a broad query**. Begin with a query like `Show me the most recent logs` to understand the structure and available fields in your logs.  
* **Disambiguate field names**. If fields have similar names and cause confusion, explicitly specify the field (e.g., `<field_name>`) to improve accuracy.  
* **Experiment with phrasing**. Try multiple variations of a query to provide context and receive more relevant suggestions.  
* **Include time or variations to add `timeslice` as a dimension**. When timeslicing data, include the term `time` in your query. For example: `Count requests, every 1m, different code challenges and user used during login attempts by time`.
* **Explore context-aware suggestions**. Use prompts like `Calculate 95th percentile latency` or `Visualize request volumes over time` to quickly surface key metrics.
* **Detect malicious activity**. Try queries like `Count register requests by 503 status code, IP, and threat confidence` to uncover potential DDoS attacks.

Below are examples of how you can phrase queries if the autocompletions and contextual suggestions are not relevant to you:

* `Count logs by` [field(s)] and `Group logs by` [field(s)] produce the same result
* `Sort by` [field(s)] [in descending order]
* `Percentage by` [field] `values`
* `Find` [stat] `for` [field] (max, min, standard deviation, etc.)
* `Filter by` [field] `contains` [keyword]
   :::note
   Keyword searches are case-sensitive.
   :::
* `Apply logreduce to logs`

More examples:

* Detecting malicious activity:
   ```
   Count logs by action. Sort the results.
   Filter results by action contains Malicious.
   ```
* Advanced analysis with users and URLs:
   ```
   Count logs by action, url, user.
   Sort the results. Filter results by action contains Malicious.
   ```  
* Root cause analysis for latency:
   ```
   Calculate 95th percentile latency by service and API.
   ```

Additional prompts can trigger more advanced activities (e.g., mapping network activity against CrowdStrike):

* `Analyze risk and severity of network activity`
* `Identify top application categories accessed`

#### Time range

By default, Copilot searches run with a 15-minute time range. If your search returns no results, consider expanding the time range.

1. Click the clock icon and select your desired time range from the dropdown.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/time-period.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />
1. Click the search button.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/search-button.png')} alt="Copilot search button" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="250" />

#### Chart type

Copilot will automatically attempt to visualize your data. For example, a query like `Top ip by geo` will trigger a geo lookup and display the results on a map:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/geo-chart.png')} alt="Copilot chart types" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

The following rules are used to deduce chart type:
* If both latitude and longitude fields exist, it returns a MAP chart type.
* If there is only one field and one record, it returns an SVP chart type. Example query: `(_sourceCategory=ic/linux/gcp) | count by %"_sourcename" | count`
* If a `sort` operator is present and there are string fields, it returns a TABLE. Given that there is a `sort` operator, probably the user is interested in `count`. Query: `(_sourceCategory=ic/linux/gcp) | count by %"_sourcename" | sort by _count`
* If there is a `_timeslice` field, it returns a LINE chart type if there are numeric fields or a TABLE chart type if there are string fields.
* If there is one string field, one numeric field, and record count is less than 6, it returns a PIE chart type. Query: `(_sourceCategory=ic/linux/gcp) | count by %"_sourcename"`.
* If there is one string field, less than 3 numeric fields, and record count is less than 20, it returns a LINE chart.
* If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to returning a TABLE chart type.

If required, select your preferred chart type, such as **Table**, **Bar**, **Column**, or **Line** view to visualize your results. You can also click **Add to Dashboard** to export an AI-generated dashboard for root cause analysis.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/chart-types.png')} alt="Copilot chart types" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

#### Edit query code

You can manually edit your log search query code if needed.

1. Click in the code editor field and edit your search. New to Sumo Logic query language? Learn more in the [Search Query Language](/docs/search/search-query-language) guide.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/code-editor.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. When you're done, press Enter or click the search button.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/play.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

:::tip
To save space, you can use the **Hide Log Query** icon to collapse the log query code.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/show-hide-query.png')} alt="Copilot time period" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
:::

#### Compatible Log Formats

Copilot querying is compatible with JSON logs, partial JSON logs, and unstructured logs with Field Extraction Rules. It cannot be used to query metrics or trace telemetry.

To retrieve a list of `_sourceCategories` with JSON data, use the following query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=* "{" "}"
| limit 10000 | logreduce keys noaggregate
| count by _sourceCategory, _schema
| where _schema != "unknown"
| sum(_count) by _sourceCategory
```

If your log query contains a mix of JSON and non-JSON formatting (i.e., a log file is partially JSON), you can isolate the JSON portion by adding a left curly brace (`{`) to the source expression to trigger **Suggestions**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/copilot-json.png')} alt="Copilot JSON formatting" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="350" />

#### History

The conversation history feature saves all previous queries and suggestions, allowing you to backtrack and refine your investigation. For example, if a status code analysis yields inconclusive results, you can revisit earlier queries to explore other possibilities.

This functionality can be useful when you're working on multiple incidents at the same time. To view Copilot interactions related to an incident, click **History**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/history.png')} alt="Copilot History" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />

There are two ways to resume a conversation:

* Click the "Resume Conversation" icon to pick up from the last query in a conversation.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/resume-convo-history1.png')} alt="Copilot History" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />
* Click on any row in a conversation history, then click the "Open in Copilot" icon to resume from a specific query in a conversation.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/resume-convo-history2.png')} alt="Copilot History" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

#### New Conversation

To start a fresh exploration, click **New Conversation**. This clears your current session and allows you to begin with a clean slate.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/new-conversation.png')} alt="Copilot new conversation" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700" />


### Step 4: Open in Log Search

You can open your query in [Log Search](/docs/search) to access Sumo Logic’s full search functionality. This allows you to continue investigating, refine your query, save the search, or take action as needed.

There are two ways to do this:

* From your conversation, click the "Open in Log Search" icon.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/open-in-log-search1.png')} alt="Copilot open in log search" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />
* From your conversation history, hover over any row, then click the "Open in Log Search" icon.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/open-in-log-search2.png')} alt="Open Copilot query in log search from History" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

### Cloud SIEM

You are a SecOps engineer who uses [Cloud SIEM](/docs/cse/). You are worried about a signal in Cloud SIEM regarding malicious network activity. You want to investigate network records and be proactive. You are under pressure to complete your investigation quickly. While familiar with Sumo Logic, you do not write log queries every day and could use a little help. Fortunately, all your Cloud SIEM records are in Sumo Logic.

1. In Copilot, you type the source for Cloud SIEM network records:
   ```
   _index=sec_record_network
   ```
1. You know what you are looking for. So, you ask:
   ```
   Count logs by action. Sort the results.
   ```
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/cloud-siem-1.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. As soon as you do that, you can look at the **Suggestions** section on the right. These suggestions are curated based on their relevance to this Cloud SIEM source. You pick a suggestion to compare results to the last hour:
   ```
   Count logs by action. Sort the results. versus the previous 1h
   ```
   Notice the system translated the suggestion to a log query and rendered results as a bar graph with no user input. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/cloud-siem-2.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Switching to table view, you notice "Malicious” in the search results. So, you add in `Filter results by action contains Malicious` to the query:
   ```
   Count logs by action. Sort the results. Filter results by action contains Malicious.
   ```
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/cloud-siem-3.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
   :::note
   If `Malicious` doesn't work, try `Malicious*`. Sumo Logic is case sensitive.
   :::
1. Next, you look for URLs that pertain to the malicious action:
   ```
   Count logs by action, url, user. Sort the results. Filter results by action contains Malicious.
   ```
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/search/copilot/cloud-siem-4.png')} alt="Copilot tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Even though the activity was blocked, you can investigate the affected users in the endpoint records next.

To summarize, you conclude there is malicious activity originating from certain users who need to be investigated further.

## Role Based Access Control

Role Based Access Control is not supported for contextual suggestions and autocompletions. It is possible for a user who is blocked by [log search RBAC](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/construct-search-filter-for-role/) to view suggestions or completions for unpermitted source expressions. However, they will not be executed by the search.
