:::sumo Query Library
For a collection of customer created search queries and their use cases, see the [Sumo Logic Community Query Library](https://community.sumologic.com/s/topic/0TOE0000000g86fOAA/Query-Library).

:::note
For a step-by-step video and tutorial about creating Sumo Logic queries, see the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://learn.sumologic.com).

The examples use this sample Apache log message where applicable:

```
10.154.181.28 - - [24/Jan/2012:12:34:58 -0700] "GET /Courses/Topics/54.htm HTTP/1.1"
200 9951 "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Chrome/16.0.912.75 Safari/535.7"
Host: raw_hosted_apps Name: /usr/sumo/collector-16.1-5/logs/reporter.log Category: apache
```

## Keyword Expressions

Look for failed attempts to su or sudo to root.

```sql
(``su`` OR ``sudo`` ) AND (fail* OR error)
```

Look for errors in sshd logs.

```sql
sshd AND (fail* OR error OR allowed OR identity)
```

Look for general authorization failures excluding router messages.

```sql
auth* AND (fail* OR error?) NOT _sourceCategory=routers
```

## Parse, Count, and Top Operators

Extract "from" and "to" fields. For example, if a raw event contains "From: Jane To: John", then from=Jane and to=John.

```sql
* | parse "From: * To: *" as (from, to)
```

Extract the source IP addresses using a regular expression for the four octets of an IP address.

```sql
*| parse regex "(\<src_i\>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
```

Identify all URL addresses visited, extract them as the "url" field.                                                         

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "GET * " as url
```

Identify traffic from Source Category "apache" and extract the source addresses, message sizes, and the URLs visited.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache
| parse "* " as src_IP
| parse " 200 * " as size
| parse "GET * " as url
```

For the Source Category "apache", calculate the total number of bytes transferred to each source IP address.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* " as src_IP 
| parse " 200 * " as size 
| count, sum(size) by src_IP
```

For the Source Category "apache", calculate the average size of all successful HTTP responses.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse " 200 * " as size 
| avg(size)
```

For the Source Category "apache", extract src, size, and URL even if the size field is missing from the log message (nodrop).

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* " as src_IP 
| parse " 200 * " as size nodrop 
| parse "GET * " as url
```

Identify the number of times a URL has been visited.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "GET * " as url 
| count by url
```

Identify the total number of pages by source IP address.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* -" as src_ip 
| count by src_ip
```

Identify the total number of pages by source IP address and re-order them by most frequently loaded pages.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* " as src_ip 
| parse "GET * " as url 
| count by url 
| sort by _count
```

Identify the top 10 requested pages.

```sql
* | parse "GET * " as url 
| count by url 
| top 10 url by _count
```

Identify the top 10 source IP addresses by bandwidth usage.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse " 200 * " as size 
| parse "* -" as src_ip 
| sum(size) as total_bytes by src_ip 
| top 10 src_ip by total_bytes
```

Identify the top 100 source IP addresses by number of hits.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache 
| parse "* -" as src_ip 
| count by src_ip 
| top 100 src_ip by _count
```

## Timeslice and Transpose

For the Source Category "apache", count by status_code and timeslice of 1 hour.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache*
| parse "HTTP/1.1\" * * \"" as (status_code, size)
| timeslice 1h
| count by _timeslice, status_code
```

For the Source Category "apache", count by status_code and timeslice of 1 hour, transpose status_code to column.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache*
| parse "HTTP/1.1\" * * \"" as (status_code, size)
| timeslice 1h
| count by _timeslice, status_code
| transpose row _timeslice column status_code
```

For the Source Category "apache", count by status_code and timeslice into 5 buckets over search result.

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache*
| parse "HTTP/1.1\" * * \"" as (status_code, size)
| timeslice 5 buckets
| count by _timeslice, status_code
```

For the Source Category "Apache/Access", count messages by status code categories, grouping all 200s, 300s, 400s, and 500s together.

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| timeslice 15m
| if (status_code matches "20*",1,0) as resp_200
| if (status_code matches "30*",1,0) as resp_300
| if (status_code matches "40*",1,0) as resp_400
| if (status_code matches "50*",1,0) as resp_500
| if (!(status_code matches "20*" or status_code matches "30*" or status_code matches "40*" or status_code matches "50*"),1,0) as resp_others
| count(*), sum(resp_200) as tot_200, sum(resp_300) as tot_300, sum(resp_400) as tot_400, sum(resp_500) as tot_500, sum(resp_others) as tot_others by _timeslice
```

Or alternately you can use:

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| timeslice 15m
| if(status_code matches "20*","200s",
if(status_code matches "30*","300s",
if(status_code matches "40*","400s",
if(status_code matches "50*","500s","Other")))) as status_code_group
| count by _timeslice, status_code_group
| transpose row _timeslice column status_code_group
```

## Conditional Operators

For the Source Category "apache", find all messages with a client error status code (40*):

```sql
_sourceCategory=apache*
| parse "HTTP/1.1\" * * \"" as (status_code, size)
| where status_code matches "40*"
```

For the Source Category "apache", count hits by browser:

```
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| extract "\"[A-Z]+ \S+ HTTP/[\d\.]+\" \S+ \S+ \S+ \"(?<agent>[^\"]+?)\""
| if (agent matches "*MSIE*",1,0) as ie
| if (agent matches "*Firefox*",1,0) as firefox
| if (agent matches "*Safari*",1,0) as safari
| if (agent matches "*Chrome*",1,0) as chrome
| sum(ie) as ie, sum(firefox) as firefox, sum(safari) as safari, sum(chrome) as chrome
```

Use the where operator to match only weekend days.

```sql
* | parse "day=*:" as day_of_week
| where day_of_week in ("Saturday","Sunday")
```

Identify all URLs that contain the subdirectory "Courses" in the path.

```sql
*| parse "GET * " as url
| where url matches "*Courses*"
```

Find version numbers that match numeric values 2, 3 or 1. Use the num operator to change the string into a number.

```sql
* | parse "Version=*." as number | num(number)
| where number in (2,3,6)
```

## LogReduce Operator

Use Sumo Logic’s clustering algorithm to look for patterns in error/exception incidents in your deployment.

```sql
exception* or fail* or error* or fatal*
| logreduce
```

## Add Metadata Fields

For any query, you can increase specificity by adding metadata fields to the keyword expression. Metadata fields include `_sourceCategory`, `_sourceHost` , and `_sourceName`.

Edit Source metadata in the **Collection** tab.

For details see [Search Metadata](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/built-in-metadata).
