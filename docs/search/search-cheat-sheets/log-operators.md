The Log Operators cheat sheet provides a list of available parsers, aggregators, search operators, and mathematical expressions with links to full details for each item. For a step-by-step video and tutorial about creating queries, see the [Quickstart Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajuNTQeOYaI). For a complete list of Sumo Logic Search operators, download the <a href="https://help.sumologic.com/files/search-operators-cheat-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version</a>.

The following tables provide a list of available Sumo Logic parsers, aggregators, search operators, and mathematical expressions.  

## Parsing

Sumo provides a number of ways to [parse](/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators) fields in your log messages.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Operator</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Example</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-predictable-patterns-using-an-anchor">parse (anchor)</a></td>
   <td>The parse operator, also called parse anchor, parses strings according to specified start and stop anchors, and then labels them as fields for use in subsequent aggregation functions in the query such as sorting, grouping, or other functions.</td>
   <td><code>| parse "User=*:" as user</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-variable-patterns-using-regex">parse regex</a></td>
   <td>The parse regex operator (also called the extract operator) enables users comfortable with regular expression syntax to extract more complex data from log lines. Parse regex can be used, for example, to extract nested fields.</td>
   <td><code>| parse regex field=url "[0-9A-Za-z-]+\.(?&lt;domain>[A-Za-z-]+\.(?:co\.uk|com|com\.au))/.*"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-keyvalue-formatted-logs">keyvalue</a></td>
   <td>Typically, log files contain information that follow a key-value pair structure. The keyvalue operator allows you to get values from a log message by specifying the key paired with each value.</td>
   <td><code>| keyvalue infer "module", "thread"</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-csv-formatted-logs">csv</a></td>
   <td>The csv operator allows you to parse Comma Separated Values (CSV) formatted log entries. It uses a comma as the default delimiter.csv operator allows you to parse Comma Separated Values (CSV) formatted log entries. It uses a comma as the default delimiter.</td>
   <td><code>| csv_raw extract 1 as user, 2 as id, 3 as name</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-json-formatted-logs">JSON</a></td>
   <td>The JSON operator is a search query language operator that allows you to extract values from JSON input. Because JSON supports both nested keys and arrays that contain ordered sequences of values, the Sumo Logic JSON operator allows you to extract single top-level fields, multiple fields, nested keys, and keys in arrays.</td>
   <td><code>| parse "explainJsonPlan] *" as jsonobject <br/>| json field=jsonobject "sessionId"<br/>| json auto</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-delimited-logs-using-split">split</a></td>
   <td>The split operator allows you to split strings into multiple strings, and parse delimited log entries, such as space-delimited formats.</td>
   <td>Full query example:<br/><code>_sourceCategory=colon<br/>| parse "] * *" as log_level, text<br/>| split text delim=':' extract 1 as user, 2 as account_id, 3 as session_id, 4 as result</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><a href="/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-xml-formatted-logs">xml</a></td>
   <td>The XML operator uses a subset of the XPath 1.0 specification to provide a way for you to parse fields from XML documents. Using it, you can specify what to extract from an XML document using an XPath reference.</td>
   <td><code>| parse xml "/af/minimum/@requested_bytes"</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Aggregating

[Aggregating functions](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators) evaluate messages and place them into groups. The group operator is used in
conjunction with group-by functions. When using any grouping function, the word by is sufficient for representing the group operator.

:::note
An aggregation function can't take another function (such as a math function). For example, you can't use:

```sql
... | avg(x + y) as average
```

Instead, use separate steps:  

```sql
... | x + y as z | avg(z) as average
```
