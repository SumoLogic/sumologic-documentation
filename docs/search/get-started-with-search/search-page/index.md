description: Understand the basic components of the Search window and how they can help you investigate your issues.
---


On the Search page you can enter [simple or complex queries] FIX (../search-basics/about-search-basics.md)to search your entire Sumo Logic data repository. You can save and select searches from your [Library](/docs/get-started/library). After running a search your results are displayed in either the **Messages** tab (for raw message data) or the **Aggregates** tab (for grouped results). See [how to navigate through search results](navigate-messages-in-search-results.md).

You can [run a saved search](../search-basics/save-search.md), [pause, or stop searches](../search-basics/pause-cancel-search.md), or [schedule a search to run periodically](../../../alerts/scheduled-searches/schedule-search.md) and notify you of the results.
