# Search Load Indicator

Searches vary considerably in the amount of load they place on the
system. All of the following can affect the search load:

-   Time range
-   How much data is scanned
-   How specific the query is

The search load indicator gives you feedback on the amount of system
load and provides suggestions on what you can do to reduce the load by
making your query more specific. 

Look for the load indicator in the bar below the bar chart in the search
results. The load indicator shows whether the search load is low,
medium, or high.

-   Low (green, one dot)
-   Medium (orange, two dots)
-   High (red, three dots)
