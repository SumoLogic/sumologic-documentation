# How to Use the Search Page

On the Search page you can enter [simple or complex queries](/docs/category/search-basics) to search your entire Sumo
Logic data repository. You can save and select searches from your [Library] (../../01Start-Here/Library.md "Library"). After running a search your results are displayed in either the **Messages** tab (for raw message data) or the **Aggregates** tab (for grouped results). See [how to navigate through search results](navigate-through-search-results.md).

You can [run a saved search](../search-basics/save-search.md), [pause, or stop searches](../search-basics/pause-cancel-search.md), or [schedule a search to run periodically] (../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches.md "Scheduled Searches") and notify you of the results.
