# Modify a Search from the results table

When you run a search your results are provided in a **Messages** tab. If the search conducted an aggregation you will also get an **Aggregates** tab. The options to modify your search will differ depending on the tab you are viewing.

## Messages tab

After running a search, you can make these changes in the **Messages** tab.

### Add to your search

After you select text and right click, you will see a menu pop up with the
following options:

| Option | Added to Search |
| -- | -- |
| Copy Selected Text | Copies the text to your computer clipboard. |
| Parse selected text/key | `[search] | parse [selected text] as [fieldName]` |
| Add selected text as AND | `[search] AND [selected text]` |
| Add selected text as AND NOT | `[search] AND ! [selected text]` |
| Add selected text as OR | `[search] OR [selected text]` |
| Add selected text as OR NOT  | `[search] OR ! [selected text]` |

After the option is added to your existing search, click **Start** (or
press Enter/Return) to run the appended search.

### Parse a field from message text

If you come across text that you'd like to [parse as a field](../../search-query-language/parse-operators/parse-field-option.md), you can select that text and name the field from the **Messages** tab.

To parse a field from message text:

1. In the search results, select the text or string you'd like to parse, right click, and click **Parse selected text**.  
      
    ![parse-msg](/img/search/get-started-search/how-to-use-search-page/Modify-a-Search-from-the-Messages-tab/parse-msg-1.png)  
     
1. In the **Parse Text** dialog box, select any text that you don't want to include in the parsed field. Then click **Extract this value**. For example, to parse just the client URL, select the unique client  URL, then select **Click to extract this value.**  
      
    ![parse-msg](/img/search/get-started-search/how-to-use-search-page/Modify-a-Search-from-the-Messages-tab/parse-msg-2.png)  
     
1. Type a name for the **Field**. This name appears at the top of the parsed column. (Field names can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (\_). The name must start and end with an alphabet character.) Then click **Submit**.  If you don't enter a field name, you will see an error in the **Search** tab. 

    ![parse-msg](/img/search/get-started-search/how-to-use-search-page/Modify-a-Search-from-the-Messages-tab/parse-msg-3.png)

1. In the **Search** tab, click **Start** to being the search.

For another example of how this works, refer to the Quick Start Tutorial topic, [Build a Search Query.] (../../../01Start-Here/Quick-Start-Tutorials/Using-Sumo-Logic-Tutorial/Lab-2:-Search-for-Log-Data.md) 

## Aggregates tab

After running an [aggregate](../../search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators "Group or Aggregate Operators") search, you can copy values and select from several options to add more operations to your query based on the results in the **Aggregates **tab.

After you select text and right click, you will see a menu pop up with the following options:

| Option | Added to Search |
| -- | -- |
| Copy Selected Text | Copies the text to your computer clipboard. |
| Add selected text as AND | \[search\] **AND** \[selected text\] |
| Add selected text as AND NOT | \[search\] **AND !** \[selected text\] |
| Add selected text as OR | \[search\] **OR** \[selected text\] |
| Add selected text as OR NOT  | \[search\] **OR !** \[selected text\] |

After the option is added to your existing search, click **Start** (or press Enter/Return) to run the appended search.
