# Save a Search

Whether you are running ad hoc searches during a forensic investigation
or running standard searches for health checks, you can save any search
to run again later.

When you create a search that you would like to reuse, you can save it
to the [Library](../../../01Start-Here/Library.md "Library"). From there
you can run it again, share with others, edit the search, or create a
[Scheduled
Search](../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches/Schedule_a_Search.md "Schedule a Search")
to run at a regularly scheduled time, and set up
[alerts](../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts.md "Alerts"). 

The saved search will also include any charts you have created in
the **Aggregates** tab. 

**To save a search:**

1.  Run a search you'd like to save.
2.  (Optional) After the search results are complete, in
    the **Aggregates** tab, select a chart type to display the data
    visually. 
3.  Click the three-dot icon and click **Save As** from the provided
    options.

6.  **Description**. (Optional). Enter a description for the search. 
7.  **Query**. You can edit your query if desired.
8.  Choose a **Time Range** that will be the default range when you run
    the saved search.
9.  **Search By**. Select if you want to save the search using message
    or receipt time. For more information, see [Use Receipt
    Time](../How-to-Build-a-Search/Use-Receipt-Time.md "Use Receipt Time").
10. **Search Mode**. Select Manual or Auto Parse Mode. For more
    information, see [Dynamic
    Parsing](../How-to-Build-a-Search/Dynamic_Parsing.md "Dynamic Parsing").
11. **Location to save to.** Select a folder location for the saved
    search 
12. Click **Save** to save the search without scheduling.  If you want
    to schedule the search and optionally configure an alert, click
    **Schedule this search** and follow the instructions on [Schedule a
    Search](../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches/Schedule_a_Search.md "Schedule a Search").
