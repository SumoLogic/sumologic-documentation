# Export Search Results

After your search query completes, you can download up to 100,000 rows
of results from your browser as a CSV (comma-separated values) text
file.

If your organization has a Sumo Logic Enterprise account, and you'd like
to export more than 100,000 rows, you can use the Search Job API to
query Sumo Logic, then page through and output the results to a file of
your choice. Learn more about the [Search Job
API](../../../APIs/Search-Job-API/About-the-Search-Job-API.md "About the Search Job API").

## Export grouped (aggregate) results

1.  From the table view of a completed query, click the **Export
    Results** icon in the **Aggregates** tab.

If the export is successful, your browser will automatically download
the data and save it to a CSV file.

## Export messages

You can export message fields to a CSV file, either just the fields
displayed, or all fields, including hidden fields.

1.  Click the gears icon in the top-right corner of
    the **Messages** tab, and then select **Export** **(Display
    Fields)** to export only the messages displayed, or **Export (All
    Fields)** to export all message fields. If the export is successful,
    your browser will automatically download the data and save it to a
    CSV file.
