# Quick Search for Collectors and Sources

You can quickly start a search for a Collector, Source, or Source
Category from the **Manage Collection** page. 

1.  In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data \> Collection** **\>
    Collection**. 
2.  Hover over the name of the Collector, Source, or Source Category (if
    a Source Category is defined) to display the small **Search**
    icon.

3.  Click the icon.

The Search page opens with the Collector, Source, or Source Category
prefilled. The search starts running automatically.   
After the search results are displayed, you can modify the search
settings, if needed, as you would for any other search.
