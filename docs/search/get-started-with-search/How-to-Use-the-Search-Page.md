# How to Use the Search Page

On the [Search](...md "Search") page you can enter [simple or complex
queries](Search-Basics.md "Search Basics") to search your entire Sumo
Logic data repository. You can save and select searches from your
[Library](../../01Start-Here/Library.md "Library"). After running
a search your results are displayed in either the **Messages** tab (for
raw message data) or the **Aggregates** tab (for grouped results). See
[how to navigate through search
results](How-to-Use-the-Search-Page/Navigating-through-Messages-in-Search-Results.md "Navigate through Messages in Search Results").

You can [run a saved
search](Search-Basics/Save-a-Search.md "Save a Search"), [pause, or stop
searches](Search-Basics/Pause_or_Cancel_a_Search.md "Pause or Cancel a Search"),
or [schedule a search to run
periodically](../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches.md "Scheduled Searches") and
notify you of the results.

## Query colors explained

In your search query, you'll see that we have separated out important
terms in a search for you by color to help you identify them quickly.
