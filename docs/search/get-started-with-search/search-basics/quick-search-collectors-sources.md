You can quickly start a search for a Collector, Source, or Source Category from the **Manage Collection** page. 

1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data > Collection** **\> Collection**. 
1. Hover over the name of the Collector, Source, or Source Category (if a Source Category is defined) to display the small **Search** icon.

1. Click the icon.

    The Search page opens with the Collector, Source, or Source Category prefilled. The search starts running automatically. After the search  results are displayed, you can modify the search settings, if needed, as you'd for any other search.
