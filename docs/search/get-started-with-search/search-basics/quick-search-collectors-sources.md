You can quickly start a search for a Collector, Source, or Source Category from the **Manage Collection** page. 

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Collection > Collection**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Data Collection** select **Collection**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Collection**. 
1. Hover over the name of the Collector, Source, or Source Category (if a Source Category is defined) to display the small **Search** icon.

    The Search page opens with the Collector, Source, or Source Category prefilled. The search starts running automatically. After the search  results are displayed, you can modify the search settings, if needed, as you'd for any other search.
