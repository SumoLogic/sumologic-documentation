# Save a Search

Whether you are running ad hoc searches during a forensic investigation or running standard searches for health checks, you can save any search to run again later.

When you create a search that you would like to reuse, you can save it to the [Library] (../../../01Start-Here/Library.md). From there you can run it again, share with others, edit the search, or create a [Scheduled Search] (../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches/Schedule_a_Search.md) to run at a regularly scheduled time, and set up [alerts] (../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts.md ). 

The saved search will also include any charts you have created in the **Aggregates** tab. 

**To save a search:**

1. Run a search you could like to save.
1. (Optional) After the search results are complete, in the **Aggregates** tab, select a chart type to display the data visually. 
1. Click the three-dot icon and click **Save As** from the provided options.

   * **Name.** Enter a name for your saved search.
   * **Description**. (Optional). Enter a description for the search. 
   * **Query**. You can edit your query if desired.

1. Choose a **Time Range** that will be the default range when you run the saved search.

   * **Search By**. Select if you want to save the search using message or receipt time. For more information, see [Use Receipt Time](../build-search/use-receipt-time.md).
   * **Search Mode**. Select Manual or Auto Parse Mode. For more information, see [Dynamic Parsing](../build-search/dynamic-parsing.md).
   * **Location to save to.** Select a folder location for the saved search.

1. Click **Save** to save the search without scheduling.  If you want to schedule the search and optionally configure an alert, click **Schedule this search** and follow the instructions on [Schedule a Search] (../../../Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches/Schedule_a_Search.md "Schedule a Search").
