These suggested searches cover some of the most common scenarios for monitoring Security, Audit, and Performance issues on a Linux server. You can enter these queries into the Search box as a starting baseline, and then customize the queries for your system.

Be sure to [save your search](../search-basics/save-search.md) queries if you plan to run them often.

These are a few valuable search queries you can enter in the Search field when you want to discover details about your Cisco ASA traffic.

The **`_sourceCategory`** fields shown in these sample queries are based on Sumo Logic's recommendations for [adding metadata to Sources](/docs/send-data/collection/edit-source.md). To re-use these queries, type the Category you entered for the relevant Source after `"_sourceCategory="` or use an asterisk wildcard (`*`) instead.
