The `smooth` operator calculates the rolling (or moving) average of a field, measuring the average of a value to "smooth" random variation. Smooth operator reveals trends in the data set you include in a query.

Within a query that contains a smooth operator you will choose a window (described as window_length in the syntax below); the average of the values within the window creates a data point.

If you specify a window length of 5, but only 4 data points are available, the smooth operator takes the average of whatever is available.

Adding a group by function to a smooth operator query produces a running average within each group (with data from each group calculated separately).

## Syntax

```sql
smooth <field> [, <window length>] [as <field>]
```

## Rules

* An alias for smooth is optional. When an alias is not provided, `_smooth` is the default alias.
* The specified field must contain numeric values.
* To add a query that includes a smooth operator to a Dashboard, you must add a group by function before the smooth operator.
* The default window length is 10.
* The maximum window length is 1000.

## Example

The following examples use the `sort` operator to sort the time prior to calculating the rolling average with `smooth`.

### Use smooth to see the difference of fields between time points, grouped by source host

Running a query such as:

```sql
_sourcecategory=katta
| timeslice by 1m
| count by _timeslice,_sourcehost
| sort + _timeslice
| smooth _count, 50 by _sourcehost
```

produces results like:

### Smooth the difference of a quantity between time points

Using smooth with timeslice, you can run a query similar to:

```sql
* | parse "bytes transmitted: '*'" as bytes
| timeslice 1m
| sum(bytes) as bytes by _timeslice
| sort _timeslice
| smooth bytes, 5
```

that produces results like:

### Use backshift with smooth and rollingstd to view the averages of incoming bytes

Running a query like:

```sql
...| timeslice by 1m
| avg(oneMinuteRate) as avgRateByHost by _sourcehost,_timeslice
| sum(avgratebyhost) as totalIncomingRate by _timeslice
| sort + _timeslice
| backshift totalIncomingRate, 1 as lagRate
| smooth lagRate,10 as movingAvg
| rollingstd lagRate,10 as rollingStd
| movingAvg + (3 * rollingStd) as upper
| movingAvg - (3 * rollingStd) as lower
```

produces results similar to:

### Specify a window length of 5, but only 4 data points are available

Before 5 values are available, the smooth operator takes an average of whatever is available. For example:

```sql
_sourcecategory=katta
| timeslice by 1m
| count by _timeslice,_sourcehost
| where _sourcehost="nite-katta-cold-4"
| sort + _timeslice
| smooth _count,5
```

produces results like:
