title: predict Search Operator
sidebar_label: predict

Uses a series of time-stamped numerical values to predict future values. The predict operator can be useful in the following cases:
<ul><li>As an early warning system, alerting you when a threshold is about to be reached.</li><li> For resource and capacity planning, helpful for determining seasonal impacts, like a Cyber Monday rush on an ecommerce site.</li>
<li>Improved risk calculation.</li></ul>

For example, you'd use `predict` to take your current disk space capacity numbers, and predict when your system might run out of disk space. In these cases, the sooner an operations manager is informed that a key threshold is about to be reached the more effectively he or she can plan to avoid service degradation.

The `predict` operator supports two predictive models:

* Auto-regressive. Uses an advanced auto-regressive (AR) algorithm to learn patterns in the data. It automatically detects the cyclical patterns in the data and uses the cycles in its prediction.   
* Linear regression. Uses existing data over the query time range as a training set to generate a [linear model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression), and then extrapolates future values using this model.

:::note
If a missing data point is encountered in the generated time series, Sumo uses a zero value and issues a warning to alert you. If you'd like to use customized values, you can do so with the [fillmissing](#fillmissing) operator.

## Syntax

The syntax for **`predict`** varies depending on whether you use the linear regression model or the auto-regressive model. In either case, the following requirements apply:

* The query must contain an aggregate operator for example, `count, min, max, sum` and so on. Aggregation must be by timeslice, for example, `count by _timeslice.`
* The query must contain the `timeslice` operator.
* Both the aggregate operator and the `timeslice` operator must precede the `predict` operator.

## Syntax for the linear regression model

For the linear regression model:

```sql
... | timeslice 1m | count by _timeslice | predict _count by 1m
```

The linear regression algorithm produces the following fields in the
output:  

* `_count` The number of matches per minute for the currently selected time range.
* `_count_predicted` Value predicted by the simple linear model.
* `_count_error` Value predicted by the simple linear model, minus the actual number.

## Syntax for the auto-regressive model

```sql
... | timeslice 1m | count by _timeslice | predict _count by 1m model=ar, ar.window=n, forecast=n
```

The table below defines the parameters for running `predict` using the AR model.

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `model=ar` | Required. Use this parameter to use the AR model, rather than a simple linear regression. |
| `ar.window` | Optional. Use this parameter to specify the number of consecutive data points on which to base the prediction.<br/><br/>The window size greatly impacts the performance of the autoregressive model. As a result, Sumo Logic automatically chooses the best default value for your query.<br/><br/>The auto-regressive model requires more data points than the linear regression option to train a proper model. We recommended that you generate more than 100 data points for the AR model. If the number of data points is less than 100, Sumo Logic displays a warning stating that the learned model may not be optimal.<br/><br/>If you want to customize the window size, we recommend that you to set the window size to be larger than 40% of the data points in the time series. However, don’t make the window size too large. The maximum would be 50%. Otherwise, the model will not be trained properly. |
| `forecast` | Optional. Use this option to specify the duration of the prediction, either in terms of data points or minutes. The forecast parameter uses the same syntax as the `timeslice` operator and accepts either:<ul><li>A simple number, such as `forecast=5`, which predicts five data points into the future.</li><li>A time granularity, such as `forecast=5m`, which predicts five minutes into the future.</li></ul><br/>If you don’t specify a value for the `forecast` parameter, the operator will default to three data points into the future, or `forecast=3`. |

In the following query, the first three lines count the number of messages that contain an error term for every half minute. The last line uses the auto-regressive model to predict 100 data points in the future, based on 50 data points.

```sql
_sourceCategory=taskmanager jobState=InQueue error | timeslice 30s | count by _timeslice | predict _count by 30s model=ar,ar.window=50,forecast=100
```

The auto-regressive algorithm produces the following fields in the
output:

* `_count` The number of errors per 30-second timeslice.
* `_count_predicted` Value predicted by the auto-regressive algorithm.
* `_count_linear` Value predicted by the simple linear regression.
* `_count_error` Value predicted by the simple linear regression minus
    the actual number.

#### Limitations

These internal limitations are meant to provide "speed bumps" to ensure the best performance.

* `predict` will not use more than 10,000 input points to estimate the model.
* `predict` will not forecast more than 100 points into the future.
* `predict` will not interpolate more than 20,000 input points. Predict adds "phantom" input points where there should be a timeslice, but no data point is present.

#### Cyclical patterns and the auto-regressive model

If there are cyclical patterns that fit within the `ar.window`, the auto-regressive algorithm will learn the cyclical pattern and use that in prediction.

For example, if there is an hourly cyclical pattern, the following query will learn that cycle:

```sql
... | timeslice 5m
| <aggregate function> by _timeslice as _val  
| predict _val by 5m model=ar, ar.window=15
```

In this query, the window size (15 consecutive data points) covers more than 1 hour (15 data points \* 5m interval = 75 minutes). So if there are cyclical patterns with a period of less than 75 minutes, the model will discover them.

**Examples**

#### predict using linear regression

This query predicts the count of 404 errors per minute using linear regression.

```sql
_sourceCategory=Labs/Apache/Access status_code=404 | timeslice 1m | count(status_code) as error_count by _timeslice | predict error_count by 1m
```

The query returns an aggregation table with columns for `error_count`, `error_count_predicted`, and `error_count_error`.

From here, you can select the **Line Chart** icon, and automatically create a Combo Chart that represents the `error_count_error` as a column chart, and the `error_count` and `error_count_predicted` mapped on top of that with separate lines. Note that the `(absolute value)_count_error` series is toggled off by default. Click it in the legend to display the column chart.
