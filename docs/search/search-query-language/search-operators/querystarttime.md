The `queryStartTime()` operator returns the start time of the searchÂ <a href="/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/set-time-range">time range</a> in milliseconds. You can use it in combination with <a href="#queryEndTime">queryEndTime()</a> to establish times and ranges for your non-continuous queries.

:::note
For dashboards in live mode or real time scheduled searches, queryTimeRange() is a more suitable option. In most cases the results would still be the same as using queryStartTime() and queryEndTime(), but the latter can be off from the real range by a few milliseconds.
