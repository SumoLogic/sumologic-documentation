Sumo Logic's three CIDR operators work with CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing, sometimes pronounced "cider") notation to narrow the analysis of IPv4 networks to specific subnets. CIDR notations specify the routing prefix of IP addresses.

Using the CIDR operators, you can determine the amount of traffic between network segments, review events from hosts within a specified network segment, or even use a not operator to find addresses that didn't originate from a particular network segment. CIDR operators can be used to compare the network segment of two IPv4 addresses, or just identify the network segment involved in particular messages.

:::note
IPv6 addresses (for example, `2001:db8::ff00:42:8329`) combine a 64-bit network address with a 64-bit host address, so identifying the network segment is easy. The network is the high-order 64 bits in the value.
:::

IPv4 addresses use a variable number of bits to describe the network. The first 24 bits, for example, might represent the subnetwork, and the remaining 8 bits identify individual hosts on that network. The portion of the address representing the network segment is called the prefix, and the number of bits allocated to the prefix is the `prefix_length`.

The standard "dotted quad" notation for IPv4 addresses can be difficult to compare if the number of bits assigned to the network is not 16 or 24. The CIDR operators are designed to help.

## getCIDRPrefix

Extracts the network prefix from an IPv4 address. 

### Syntax

```sql
getCIDRPrefix("<ip_addr>", "<prefix_length>") as <field>
```

Where:

* `ip_addr` is a string representation (such as "10.10.1.35")
* `prefix_length` is an integer value in string/text format (0-32)

### Examples

The following returns `10.10.1.0`:

```sql
getCIDRPrefix("10.10.1.35", "24") as net
```

The following returns `10.10.1.32`:

```sql
getCIDRPrefix("10.10.1.35", "27") as net
```

The following returns `10.10.1.32`:

```sql
getCIDRPrefix("10.10.1.35", "29") as net
```

## compareCIDRPrefix

Compares two IPv4 addresses and returns true if the network prefixes match.

### Syntax

```sql
compareCIDRPrefix("<ip_addr1>", "<ip_addr2>", "<prefix_length>") as <field>
```

`ip_add1` and `ip_addr2` are string representations (such as "10.10.1.35")

`prefix_length` is an integer value in string/text format (0-32)

**Boolean expression syntax**

```sql
compareCIDRPrefix(<ip_addr1>, <ip_addr2>, "<prefix_length>")
```

### Examples

To review events from a specific network segment:

1. Search for the events. For example, let's say we'd like to review firewall logs:
    ```
    (denied OR rejected AND _sourcecategory=firewall | ...
    ```
1. Parse the IP addresses. For example:   
    ```sql
    ... | parse "ip=*," as ip_address ...
    ```
1. Compare to the full CIDR notation you requested. For example, 10.10.1.32/27:  
    ```sql
    ... | where compareCIDRPrefix("10.10.1.32", ip_address, "27") | ...
    ```
1. Keep matching records, and drop non-matching records from search results:  
    ```sql
    ... | count by ip_address
    ```

To review events not from a specific network segment:

1. Search for the events. For example, let's say we'd like to review firewall logs:  
   ```
   (denied OR rejected AND _sourcecategory=firewall | ...
   ```
1. Parse the IP addresses. For example:   
    ```sql
    ... | parse "ip=*," as ip_address ...
    ```
1. Compare to the full CIDR notation you requested, and drop matching records. For example, 10.10.1.32/27:  
    ```sql
    ... | where !compareCIDRPrefix("10.10.1.32", ip_address, "27") | ...
    ```

## maskFromCIDR

A utility function that returns a subnet mask for boolean operations with IPv4 addresses.

### Syntax

```sql
maskFromCIDR("<prefix_length>") as <field>
```

Where:

* `prefix_length` is an integer value in string/text format (0-32)

|  CIDR |   Mask |
|-|:--|
| 32       | 255.255.255.255 |
| 31       | 255.255.255.254 |
| 30       | 255.255.255.252 |
| 29       | 255.255.255.248 |
| ...      | ...             |
