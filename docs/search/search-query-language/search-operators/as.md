The `as` operator is typically used in conjunction with other operators, but it can also be used alone to rename fields or to create new constant fields.

## Syntax

```sql
<ExistingFieldName> as <field>
```

```sql
<literal> as <field>
```

## Rules

Fields with characters not in the `a-zA-Z0-9_` character set or that begin with a number need to be escaped, see [reference a field with special characters](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/reference-field-special-characters) for details.


## Examples

### Rename a Field

When you rename a field, the original field still exists, but the new field is added.

To rename the existing field `ip_addr` as `src_ip`, use:

```sql
ip_addr as src_ip
```

So, the following full query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| parse "* - - " as ip_addr
| ip_addr as src_ip
```

Would provide results like:

### Create a New Constant Field

In this example, you will seed an existing field (`src_ip`) with a new constant (`127.10.10.1`):

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| "127.10.10.1" as src_ip
```

This statement “hardcodes" the value of `127.10.10.1` to the variable `src_ip`, for all the messages returned, as shown:

![new constant](/img/reuse/query-search/as_new_constant1.png)

In this example, you will create a new field (`test_src_ip`) and seed it with a constant (`127.10.10.1`):

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| parse "* - -" as src_ip
| "127.10.10.1" as test_src_ip
```

Which provides the following results:

![new constant](/img/reuse/query-search/as_new_constant2.png)

### Use As in Conjunction with Other Operators

The `as` operator is useful for testing, for example, when you want to create a few log lines and seed them with specific values, like the following query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| limit 5
| "127.10.10.1" as src_ip
| "404" as status_code
| "www.sumologic.com" as url
```

Which provides the following results:

![conjunction](/img/reuse/query-search/as_conjunction.png)

In this next example, you will use `as` after a parse, to name the variable in the pattern `"\* - - "` as `src_ip`:

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access
| parse "* - - " as src_ip
```

In this example, you will use `as` to rename the `_count` field to `errors`.  

```sql
_sourceCategory=Apache/Access status_code=404
| count(status_code) as errors
```
