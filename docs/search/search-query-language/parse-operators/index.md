# Parse Operators

Parse operators allow you to extract fields from log messages within a query manually and on an ad-hoc basis.

For best practices use Parse operators to build [Field Extraction Rules] (../../Manage/Field-Extractions.md) to automatically extract field values and use them to extend your query.

Before reading about our parse operators review our [documentation styles] (../../01Start-Here/03About-Sumo-Logic/Help_Documentation_Styles.md).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

In this section, we will introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
