Your searches may lead you to focus on particular keywords in your log, and you can highlight these words in a running Live Tail session to make them more visible.

To highlight keywords in Live Tail:

1. Click the **A** button.
1. In the dialog that displays, enter a term to highlight. You can use single keywords or multi-term keywords separated by spaces.

The different keywords are then highlighted using different colors so that they are easy to find on the screen. You can highlight up to eight keywords.
