# LogReduce

The LogReduce algorithm uses fuzzy logic to cluster messages together
based on string and pattern similarity. Use the LogReduce button and
operator to quickly assess activity patterns for things like a range of
devices or traffic on a website.

The summarize operator has been renamed the logreduce operator, to match
the **LogReduce** button on the **Messages** tab. Both operators will
continue to work in search queries as synonyms for a limited time. We
recommend that you rewrite saved queries replacing summarize with
logreduce.
