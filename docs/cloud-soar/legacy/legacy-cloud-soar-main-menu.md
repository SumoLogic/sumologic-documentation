## Dashboards

### KPI Reports

Besides exporting dashboard statistics, users can also build KPI
reports. To create a KPI report, click **KPI Reports** at the top of the
screen next to the Export functionality. A new configuration box will be
displayed.

The **Output Set** tab allows users to select the incident kind they wish
to run the KPI report for. The Output Set and Description fields allow
the user to set these values for KPI reports they wish to save and
generate again in the future.

The **Filters** tab allows users to filter the data which will be included
in the KPI report by any number of incident attributes.

The **Display** tab allows users to select which fields will be shown in
the KPI report. To include a field in the KPI report, check the checkbox
next to the field name to be included. Field order can be changed by
clicking on the six dots to the far left of the field name and dragging
the field name up or down.

The **Format** tab allows users to select various formatting options, such
as the sorting order and the file format (including PDF, PDF encrypted
with an encryption key file, and Excel). Reports can also be scheduled
to automatically run at a defined interval from this section.

Once the report is built, click **Generate** to run the report or **Save**
to create the KPI report template.

KPI Output Sets can also be generated using the Cloud SOAR API. Please see
the API manual for additional details.

## Entities

### Activity Log

Cloud SOAR records a detailed audit log of all activity that is performed during an incident. A timeline of incident activity can be viewed in the incident Timeline section. Each incident has its own timeline and the events are classified under two categories: automatic if generated automatically by the system, or manual when created by the user.

To manually create a new timeline event, click **+Add New Event** from the top of the timeline screen.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image170.png')} alt="Add New Event" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

A new configuration box will be displayed. Title the event and choose
what category the event falls into. (Please note, these categories can
be edited under the Custom Fields section). Add any additional
information necessary and associate an existing knowledge base article
where applicable.  

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image171.png')} alt="Add New Event Screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>

Once the event is created, users will see an additional list of options to the right of the event, they are as follows:

- Use event data in reports
- Mark event has irrelevant
- Edit the event
- Export event details

### Final Incident Reports

The Final Incident Report section allows users to upload a
pre-configured basedoc to be used for final incident reports. Users can
choose to use an existing basedoc or upload a new one by selecting from
the basedoc selections at the bottom of the screen.    

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image173.png')} alt="Final Report Screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>

To add a new basedoc, click **Upload Basedoc** and select the template to
use and click **Save**. Once the document has been uploaded users can
choose which sections or tags to use in the report. These tags act as
placeholders which will be filled in with the incident's details each
time an incident report is executed.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image174.png')} alt="Basedoc Tag List" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

To add tags to the incident report, double click the tag from the
right-side of the screen and it will be added to the tagging section for
configuration. Once the tag is added, users can either edit the tag or
remove unnecessary ones before executing the final report. Once finished, click **Export Final Report** at the bottom of the screen.

### Custom Reports

Custom report templates can be defined by navigating to **Configurations** > **Customizations** > **Report Template**. The left pane of the Report Template screen contains a list of all current report templates. To add a new report template, click on the **+** icon above the report template list.

The Details tab of the new report template window allows the user to
specify a unique name for the template as well as a template category
and any appropriate tags.

The Sections tab of the new report template window allows users to drag
and drop sections of the incident in to the report template. All
incident sections are listed in the left-hand pane. Dragging incident
sections to the right-hand pane will add the section to the report
template. Sections will be printed in the report in the order they
appear in the right-hand pane. 

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image45.png')} alt="Report Templates" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>

Once a report template has been defined, it can be generated by
selecting **Custom Report** from the **Export** menu. Users may add a
password or watermark to the custom report, which may be generated in
PDF or Word Document format.
