## Incidents

Incidents are events that require investigation and remediation. Incidents are at the heart of Cloud SOAR. 

<!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#classic-ui). Kanso--> To access incidents, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then select **Incidents** at the top of the SecOps screen.
<!--Kanso 
[**New UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#new-ui). To access incidents, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR > Incidents**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Incidents**.
 Kanso-->

The **Incidents** screen lists all Cloud SOAR incidents. Clicking on any of the incident IDs will open the incident. You can configure what incidents are displayed by creating queries against available incident data and saving them as incident filters.

### Incident generation process

Cloud SOAR generates incidents with an automated process:
 1. An alert is received by Cloud SOAR via an integration.
 1. [Automation rules](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#creating-incidents-from-automation-rules) process the alert. Behind the scenes, parsing rules break out the data into artifacts to be used as arguments in playbooks, such as IP addresses, usernames, host names, and so on.
 1. The data is fed into an [incident template](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#incident-templates).
 1. [Playbooks](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#playbook) run against the data.
 1. Cloud SOAR generates an incident.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-automation-flow.png')} alt="Cloud SOAR automation flow" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

### Filter incidents

You can configure what data is to be displayed on the **Incidents** screen by adjusting which columns are viewable. To adjust these columns, click the filter icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/filter-icon.png')} alt="Filter icon" width="25"/> in the top right corner of the screen. This displays a configuration screen that allows you to choose which data is displayed. To change where on the screen it should be displayed, click the **+** next to the selection and  drag and drop it in the order to be viewed. Once you have added and organized the columns, click **Apply**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/filter-incidents.png')} alt="Filter incidents" width="800"/>

#### Search incidents

From the **Incidents** screen you can search, build, and issue queries against existing incidents by typing in the search bar at the top of the screen.

Cloud SOAR also provides you with a command cheat sheet to help build incident filtering queries. To access the cheat sheet, click on the information icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/commands-cheat-sheet.png')} alt="Commands cheat sheet icon" width="25"/> in the search bar to display the query options.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image142.png')} alt="Search issues" width="800"/>

#### Favorite incident searches

Once a query or a search is committed, they can be saved for future use by clicking the star icon to the right of the search bar. These saved searches will be stored as bookmarks to the right of the search bar.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image145.png')} alt="save query" width="800"/>

#### Bulk actions

Bulk actions may be performed on any incidents in the incidents list. To perform bulk actions on incidents, check the incidents you wish to perform the bulk actions on, then click the three-dot kebab menu in the upper left-hand corner of the screen and select the appropriate bulk action from the dropdown menu.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/bulk-actions.png')} alt="Bulk actions" width="200"/>

### Add investigators

Investigators are users who are involved in incidents and have access to perform operations on the incidents and view the incident data. To be able to add investigators to incidents, you must be assigned the **Manage Investigators** [Cloud SOAR role capability](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#cloud-soar).

To add investigators to incidents:

1. <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#classic-ui). Kanso--> At the top of the screen, click **Incidents**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#new-ui). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Cloud SOAR > Incidents**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Incidents**.  Kanso-->
1. Check the incidents you want to add investigators to.
1. Click the three-dot kebab menu in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
1. Select **Add Investigator**.<br/>The **Add Investigator** screen is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-add-investigator.png')} alt="Add Investigator dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Select the investigators to add to the selected incidents.
   :::info
   You can also select groups in addition to selecting individuals. For more information, see [Groups](/docs/cloud-soar/overview/#groups).
   :::
1. In the **Role** column, select the role assigned to the users that you want them to have as investigators. For example, select Analyst, Administrator, or some other role. The roles must have the appropriate Cloud SOAR role capabilities that you want them to have as investigators of the incidents.
1. Click **Apply**.

#### View investigators assigned to an incident

1. <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#classic-ui). Kanso--> At the top of the screen, click **Incidents**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#new-ui). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Cloud SOAR > Incidents**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Incidents**.  Kanso-->
1. Select an incident. The investigators appear in the **Investigators** widget. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-incident-investigators.png')} alt="Investigators widget" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. To add another investigator to the incident, click the **+** icon in the upper-right of the dialog.
1. To remove an investigator from the incident, hover your mouse over the investigator name and click the trash can icon that appears to the right.
1. To change the role an investigator has for the incident, in the **Role** column select the role assigned to the user that you want them to have as an investigator.

#### Investigator roles

When you add an investigator to an incident, you select the [role assigned to the users](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/add-remove-users-role/) that you want them to have as an investigator. The selected role must have the appropriate [Cloud SOAR role capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#cloud-soar) that you want the investigator to have to be able to effectively investigate the incident.

For example, an incident contains sensitive data in the notes section. If you want the investigators on the incident to be able to access the notes data, the investigators you assign to the incident must have the **Note > Access** Cloud SOAR role capability assigned to their role.

:::note
To allow users to access incidents without being added as investigators, assign them the **Incident > Access all** role Cloud SOAR role capability. This privilege is useful for users who need to monitor all incidents.
:::

### Create a new incident manually

1. To create an incident manually, click the **+** button at the top of the **Incidents** screen. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/create-incident-button.png')} alt="Create incident button" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="100"/>
1. A new configuration box will be displayed that contains fields an investigator can utilize to develop their incident. Not all these fields are mandatory. The ones that are required will have an asterisk (`*`) marked next to them which indicates the field has a dependency within the Cloud SOAR platform. These required fields can have their dependencies and requirements adjusted with [custom fields](/docs/cloud-soar/overview/#custom-fields). <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-creation-screen.png')} alt="Incident Creation screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. One of the most important fields is the **Type** field. This field will dictate which playbooks will be recommended later on in the configuration process. See [custom fields](/docs/cloud-soar/overview/#custom-fields) to modify the variables displayed in the **Type** field. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/type-field.png')} alt="Type field" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="200"/>
1. Click **Next**. 
1. Once you complete the **Details** page, you will want to assign appropriate playbooks to be associated with the incident. In addition to adding playbooks to the incident, you can also decide whether you want the playbook to automatically execute upon incident creation by sliding the **Autorun** button to **On**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-creation-automation.png')} alt="Incident Creation - Automation screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Click **Next**. 
1. The investigator may already have artifacts that they would like to add to the incident. The **Artifacts** section allows for the manual entry of new artifacts. To add a new artifact, click **Add Artifact** and choose what target field to append the data and add its value. Once completed, click **Next**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-creation-artifacts.png')} alt="Incident Creation - Artifacts screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Click **Next**.
1. You have the option to create manual parent/child relationships between the new incident and any previous incident created in Cloud SOAR. Click the **Advanced** button at the bottom of the screen to select an existing incident to group together. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-creation-relationship.png')} alt="Incident Creation - Relationships screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Click **Next**.
1. The final step in manual incident creation is to add an investigator or a group of investigators to the incident. Select an investigator or group from the left side of the screen by double-clicking on their name and the investigator will be added to the investigators pane. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-creation-investigators.png')} alt="Incident Creation - Investigators screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Once finished, click **Create**.

## Incident details

Opening an incident from any section of Cloud SOAR will display the incident details page. The page is composed of three sections: The incident VIP section on the left, the properties section in the center, and the widgets section to the right.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-details.png')} alt="Incident details page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

The incident VIP section displays high-level details about a specific incident. You can also take actions such as add additional investigators or close the incident from this section. To view all available actions, click the vertical ellipsis to the left of the cogwheel. You can change the owner of the incident, change the folder where the incident is housed, export the incident details via PDF, DOC, or custom report], and clone or permanently delete the incident. To customize the details displayed in the incident VIP section, click the cogwheel <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cogwheel-icon.png')} alt="Cogwheel icon" width="25"/> at the top right of the section. A new screen will be presented which will allow for adding and deleting of incident detail fields. To add a new field, you will click on the **+** sign next to the field to be added. Once all the desired fields are added, they can easily be rearranged in the desired order by dragging and dropping into place. To remove a field, simply click the **x** next to the field to be removed. Once all the details have been added and are in place, click **Apply**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-vip-section.png')} alt="Incident VIP section" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="200"/>

The incident properties section in the center contains all the important information that makes up the incident, such as executed playbooks and incident tasks. This information is divided into four different sections: **Overview**, **Operations**, **Entities**, and **Documentation**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/incident-properties.png')} alt="Incident properties" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

### Overview tab

The incident **Overview** tab contains all the pertinent information for a specific incident such as the severity, SLA counter, and category of alert. This information can be configured in [custom fields](/docs/cloud-soar/overview/#custom-fields). 

### Operations tab

The **Operations** tab contains all the investigative information for a specific incident and is broken out into the following sections: **War Room**, **Playbook**, **Tasks**, and **Notes**.

#### War Room

All the information related to the ongoing incident is  visible in one place in the **War Room** section. You can quickly view and check all the steps of the analysis, done either manually or by the automation, any entities related to the incident, results of actions performed, and notes added during the incident's investigation. Information can be filtered out for the different categories, and you can add new notes by clicking the **+** button.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/war_room.png')} alt="War room" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

#### Playbooks

Any playbook that has been applied to an incident can be found under the **Playbooks** section. You can quickly view and make any necessary adjustments to the incident's playbooks, as well as add any additional playbooks that may be required during an incident's investigation.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/operations-playbooks-tab.png')} alt="Playbooks displayed in the Playbooks tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

If during an incident's investigation it is determined that the type of incident has changed (for example, a phishing incident turns into a ransomware incident) another type of playbook may be needed to correctly remediate an incident. You can add additional playbooks to the incident by clicking **+** at the top of the screen to the left of the **Graph View** and **List View** buttons. This will open a new screen that lists all available playbooks. Either type in the playbook name to use, or manually search through all available options and click **Add** when finished.

To explore the playbooks:

1. Click the clock icon to see playbook history. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/playbook-history.png')} alt="Playbook history" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. To view individual playbooks for the incident, click **Graph View** at the top of the panel. In the graph view, the playbook options menu can be found at the bottom of the playbook screen to re-run a playbook, download playbook results, edit the playbook, or expand the playbook. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/operations-playbooks-graph-view.png')} alt="Playbook displayed in the graph view" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. To view the details of any individual action, click on the action node. A new window displaying the action details will be displayed on the left-hand side of the screen. From this view, you can see the status of the action, its configuration, and have the choice to download the JSON results of the action. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/action-details.png')} alt="Action details" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. To view the details of the result, click the magnifying glass icon at the bottom of the action details, and the action result window will display. You can use the search bar at the top of the table to search the results.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/action-result.png')} alt="Action result" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500"/>
1. Because some integrations return large data sets, the table view is designed to show only a select set of attributes. For more detailed information, you can switch to the action's JSON results screen by clicking the **JSON Details** icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/json-details-icon.png')} alt="JSON Details icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> next to the action's search bar. The JSON results view displays the full results of the executed action.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/action-result-json-details.png')} alt="Action result JSON details" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500"/>

#### Tasks

The **Tasks** section allows incident managers to assign and track tasks which must be completed during an investigation. You can add tasks manually here, or add them from playbooks.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/task-list.png')} alt="Tasks section" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

To explore tasks:

1. Click a task to open it. From the resulting window you can not only view information about the task, but take actions such as approve, decline, or close the task, as well as launch the associated playbook.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/tasks-screen.png')} alt="Task details" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. To add a new Task, click the **+** button at the top-left of the Task list screen. Fill in all required fields and add any additional information necessary under the **Description** section if desired. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/new-task.png')} alt="New task dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
    * The user listed in the **Assigned to** field will be the user responsible for completing the task.
    * The field titled **Actual Effort** should be the number of hours estimated to complete the task. As the task is updated by the assignee, this field should be changed to reflect the actual number of hours that were required to complete the task. This number will be used to provide task assessment information.
1. Once a task has been created and assigned, it will appear in the [SecOps](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#secops-and-dashboard) screen. To view the details of a task, click on the task from the **My Operations** section of the screen. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-secops.png')} alt="Home page" width="800"/>
1. Selecting a task will open the incident where the task was created. This will allow you to review the details of the task and access any automated playbooks and notes from the incident investigation. Once the incident data has been reviewed, investigators can choose to approve, approve and close, or decline a task by clicking the thumbs up, thumbs
down or check mark buttons next to the task's title. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/tasks-screen_approve-decline-buttons.png')} alt="Task buttons" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

#### Notes

The **Notes** section contains all notes either automatically created during a playbook's execution or manually created during the incident's investigation. You can export notes and search for results depending on the operational need.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/notes.png')} alt="Notes" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

To explore notes:

1. To manually add a note, click **+** to the left of the search bar and a new configuration screen will appear. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/new-note.png')} alt="New note dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. Enter the note into the free form text box and click **Create** when finished.
1. When you close an incident, the system will prompt you for a note describing the reason. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/close-incident.png')} alt="Close Incident button" width="800"/>
1. In the **Closing Note** field, enter a note explaining the reason for incident closure and click **Apply**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/close-incident-note.png')} alt="Closing note dialog" width="800"/>

### Entities tab

The **Entities** tab shows the entities associated with the incident. Entities are unique actors encountered in incoming messages, such as a user, IP address, or host.

To see entities for all incidents, open the **Entities** page. For more information, see [Entities](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#entities). 

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/entities-panel.png')} alt="Entities tab" width="700"/>

### Documentation tab

The **Documentation** tab provides investigators with an area to document all steps taken during an incident's investigation.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/documentation.png')} alt="Documentation tab" width="700"/>

The **Attachments** section is a repository for investigators to house attachments related to an incident's investigation. The source of this data can vary, but will often be the output of monitoring tools and supporting documents. 

To add an attachment, click **+** to the left of the search bar and provide a description for the attachment. When an attachment is added, the date and the name of the person who added it are recorded with the attachment. 

## Triage

The **Triage** screen shows events that have been recorded but not yet converted to incidents. 

<!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#classic-ui). Kanso--> To access the **Triage** screen, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**. Then in the upper left of the **SecOps** screen click **Incidents > Triage**.
<!--Kanso 
[**New UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#new-ui). To access the **Triage** screen, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR > Triage**. 
 Kanso-->

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/triage.png')} alt="Triage screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

The Cloud SOAR triage module ingests events via the Cloud SOAR API. You can use it
to triage events which may be unverified or have a low confidence level before they are converted to incidents. The triage module can be completely customized for use cases from financial fraud to network IDS alerts.

Triage events can be pending (not assigned yet), grabbed (assigned to an analyst), or converted to an incident (either automatically or manually).

Let's suppose you want to look at a pending event to determine if it needs investigation:

1. Click a pending event. The event opens.
1. You determine that you want to investigate the event. Click the three-dot kebab button and select **Grab**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/grab-an-event.png')} alt="Grab on the dropdown menu" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. Once an event is grabbed by an analyst, any playbooks defined for that incident type will be automatically executed and the results will be displayed in the **Filtered Results** section of the event details screen. Because all playbooks for the specified incident type are automatically executed as soon as the incident is grabbed, it is recommended that separate incident types and playbooks be created for triage events.
1. After you triage the event, you may reassign it to another user for further analysis, discard it, or convert it to an incident:
   * To reassign the event, click **Reassign**. 
   * To discard it, click the three-dot kebab button and select **Discard**. 
   * To convert it an incident, click the three-dot kebab button and select **Convert to Incident**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/reassign-discard-convert-event.png')} alt="Reassign or convert to incident" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>      
1. When you click **Convert to Incident**, a dialog appears for you to select the conversion settings. Select the appropriate incident template, owner, and ID, then click **Apply**. The event, including all enrichment information gathered from any playbooks, will be automatically converted to an incident. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/convert-to-incident-dialog.png')} alt="Convert to incident dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="300"/>

### Triage field settings

By default, the triage module contains two fields, `Status` and `Type`. Additional values may be added to the `Status` field; however, the `Type` field is directly linked to the incident type field and cannot be modified directly. 

New types must be added from the incidents section of the **Custom Fields** page. Up to 100 custom fields and be created for the triage module, allowing customization for any use case. To add additional custom fields for triage, see [Custom fields](/docs/cloud-soar/overview/#custom-fields). 

Note that to be able to filter events in the triage module based on the values of a field, **Use as filter** must be checked when adding or modifying a field. As fields are created, they will be assigned a number starting at `1`, which will be used to identify the field when adding events via the API. The first field added will be identified as `opt_1`, the second as `opt_2`, and so on. Regardless of the ordering of the fields on the screen, these numbers will remain the same. If a field is deleted, the number will not be reused. For example, if you have defined `opt_1` through `opt_8` and delete the field `opt_8`, the next field added will still become `opt_9`. It is important to remember these field numbers, as they will be used when the API is invoked.

#### Attributes sent from Cloud SIEM

You can ingest Cloud SIEM Insights into Cloud SOAR for incident triage using the `GetInsight` Cloud SOAR API. The following Insight attributes are returned.

When you create an incident from an Insight, you can map the Insight attributes to fields in Cloud SOAR as follows:

| Attribute in Cloud SIEM | Field in Cloud SOAR |
| :-- | :-- |
| `assignee` | `Insight Assignee` (custom field) |
| `created` | `Start time` |
| `description` | `Additional Info` |
| `entity.value` | `Primary Entity` (custom field) |
| `entity.type` | `Entity Type` (custom field) |
| `id` | `Insight ID` (custom field) |
| `involvedEntities[].value` | `Involved Entities` (custom field) |
| `readableId` | `Incident ID` |
| `severity` | `Severity` |
| `status.displayName` | `Status` |
| `tags[]` | `Tags` |

:::note
When creating incidents from Insights, adding additional required attributes to the incident template will result in an error. Only those attributes sent over with Insights can be used as required attributes on the template.
:::

## Entities

The **Entities** screen shows information about entities, unique actors encountered in incoming messages, such as a user, IP address, or host. Entities displayed here are from all incidents. To see entities associated with a specific incident, see [Entities tab](#entities-tab). 

<!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#classic-ui). Kanso--> To access the **Entities** screen, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then click the **Entities** button at the top of the screen.
<!--Kanso 
[**New UI**](/docs/cloud-soar/overview#new-ui). To access the **Entities** screen, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR > Entities**.
 Kanso-->

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/entities.png')} alt="Entity section" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

To explore entities:

1. Click an entity in the list to display the results of any previous actions taken on the entity, or where in the incident the entity was extracted. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/entity-details.png')} alt="Entity details" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Click the stopwatch icon to see the entity's history timeline. Click the date tabs to see additional information about the actions taken on each date. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/entity-history.png')} alt="History tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Hover your mouse over an entity to:
   * **Lock**: Lock the entity to prevent any actions from being taken on it. This may be useful if you want to ensure that no enrichment actions are taken on attacker-controlled infrastructure or that an entity is not accidentally blocked.
   * **Delete**: Delete the entity record.
   * **Favorite**: Mark the entity as a favorite and move it to the top of the entity list. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/entity-actions-on-hover.png')} alt="Entity actions" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. To manually add an entity, click **+** at the top of the screen to the left of **Entity**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/add-entity-button.png')} alt="Button to add an entity" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="100"/>
1. In the **New Object** dialog, select an entity type from the **Object Type** dropdown menu. Enter information about the entity and then click **Create**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/create-entity.png')} alt="New Object dialog to create a new entity" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>

## Dashboards

Cloud SOAR's **Dashboards** section highlights the most important pieces of data to the user or investigator who is logged into the platform. This data is presented through the use of multiple widgets that you can add, remove, and customize to include all data relevant to your job functions and duties.
