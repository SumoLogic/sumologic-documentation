Cloud SOAR fully automates triage, investigation, and remediation of threats for any security professional. The open integrations framework allows you to connect to a multitude of third-party applications. The platform provides full incident response lifecycle management with machine learning and threat hunting, accelerating mean time to respond (MTTR).

## Why Cloud SOAR?

Cloud SOAR is a security operations technology platform that empowers MSSPs, SOCs, and security teams by providing collaborative and automated real-time incident management and threat response. Make quick and insightful decisions during security response with workflow automation.

* **All-in-one platform for minimizing the response time**
   * Integrates disparate technologies focusing analysts on real threats.
   * Makes the most of automation, orchestrating several tools in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
   * Measures success and improves communication.
* **Better collaboration**
<br/>Cloud SOAR’s native orchestration capabilities boost the collaboration within the SOC team, ensuring efficient synergy during each phase of incident response. Automation of the full incident lifecycle eases the burden on security analysts, while helping to successfully pinpoint real threats and coordinate an effective response across tools and team members.
* **Customizable reports**
<br/>Quickly assemble highly customizable reports and dashboards to easily navigate and assess your security intelligence portfolio. Use relevant templates to capture workflow processes, job functions, and response timeframes, including critical indicators of compromise (IOC) and corrective actions taken. Use reports to create greater visibility for KPIs and make collective improvements across the SOC team.
* **Speed incident response**
<br/>Cloud SOAR improves incident response time with flexible workflow automation across tools and teams. Machine learning distinguishes real threats from false positives to reduce alert fatigue.
* **Connect disparate tools**
<br/>Cloud SOAR acts as the connective tissue between your existing tools to automate processes across the SOC and derive relevant insights throughout your security portfolio.
* **Close the skill gap**
<br/>Automated workflow processes help analysts function at an optimal level and reduce the skills gap that exists from the lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals.
* **Comprehensive security portfolio**
<br/>Cloud SOAR comprises both the Automation Service, which allows Sumo Logic to leverage the power of automated playbooks, and the full Cloud SOAR. Cloud SOAR combines automation with case management, among many other capabilities aimed at helping your organization modernize security operations.

## Cloud SOAR highlights

Cloud SOAR helps secure operations and automate incident response through integrations with leading third-party threat intelligence vendors. Following are some of the highlights. 

### Triage

Cloud SOAR provides automated investigation of indicators of compromise (IoCs) for cyber and non-cyber use cases. For more information, see [Triage](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#triage).

 Kanso-->

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-groups.png')} alt="Groups dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

#### Create a group

You can create a group of users and assign a role to all the users in the group. This makes it easy to assign a specialized role to multiple users at once rather than adding the users individually to the role.

For example, say there is a group of users with different roles responsible for customer support. Access to a specific incident with restricted privileges needs to be granted to all investigators of the incident. You can create a role with just the needed [Cloud SOAR role capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#cloud-soar) and select it as the role (also known as a profile) for members of the group. Then when you [add investigators](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#add-investigators) for the incident, you can select the group rather than individual users.

1. Click the **+** icon next to **Groups**. The **Add Groups** dialog is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-add-group.png')} alt="Add Group dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. In **Name** enter a name for the group.
1. In **Profile** select the role to use for members of the group. These are [roles](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/) already created in the system. 
1. Click **Create**. The empty group is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-example-group.png')} alt="Example group" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. Click the **+** icon next to **Members**. 
1. Select the users to add to the group.
1. Click **Apply**. 

#### Group role assignments

The role specified in an assigned group profile supersedes the user's [role assignments in the Sumo Logic Log Analytics Platform](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/add-remove-users-role/). The group permissions are persistent until the user leaves the group, the profile is removed from the group, or the group is deleted. 

| User | Result | 
| :-- | :-- |
| In a group | Has the assigned group role (profile) |
| In multiple groups |  Has the sum of the roles (profiles) from all the groups it is a member of |
| Not in a group | Has role assignments as assigned in the core platform |
| In group without a role (profile) | Has role assignments as assigned in the core platform |

### Notifications

 Kanso-->

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-custom-fields.png')} alt="Cloud SOAR custom fields page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

The **Custom Fields** page allows you to customize all fields within the Cloud SOAR platform to better suit your environment. All fields are pre-populated by default and can be revised with environment-specific variables by manually creating or updating the fields. To begin defining Cloud SOAR's custom fields, select a Cloud SOAR section from the list on the left-side of the screen to view all available fields. To edit an existing field, hover your mouse over the field and select the <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image47.png')} alt="Edit icon" width="30"/> icon that appears next to the field. To add a new field, click the **+** button at the top of the panel.  

Tips for working with custom fields:
* For considerations when you create custom fields for triage, see [Triage field settings](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#triage-field-settings).
* You can rename or delete custom fields that you add. However, you can only rename default fields; you cannot delete them. Although you may delete a custom field, it will not increase the number of custom fields available. Since the deleted field may contain data that was entered prior to the deletion of the field, the custom field remains reserved. You can rename internal values, but only personal values (denoted by having a trash can symbol next to the entry), can be deleted from the section's custom fields.
* For each field, a name and a type will always be required. The only attribute of an existing field that cannot be modified once the field is created is the field Type, such as Text or Date.  
* Each section of Cloud SOAR supports different numbers of custom fields. The **Incidents** section, for example, supports up to 100 custom fields. The number of custom fields remaining will be displayed next to the section name at the top of the page.
* When you edit a field, the **Additional info** section allows you to provide additional information or context to the field, such as how the field should be used or where the data can be located.
* You can reorder fields in the **Custom Fields** section to change the order they appear on the Cloud SOAR screen. To change the order of the fields, click and hold on the six dots to the far left of the field name, then drag the field to its desired location.

A complete list of field types is listed below. Additional fields are required or optional depending on the type selected. For example, a text field allows an optional default value to be specified, while a list field provides many additional options. 

#### Custom field types

| Field Type        | Description                                                                                       |

#### Using custom fields for SLAs

Custom fields can be used to calculate any number of custom service level agreements (SLAs). This can be achieved using combinations of `Date`, `Date & Time`, and `Time Interval` type fields.

In the following example, custom fields provide information on the status of an organization's notification SLA. Two of the custom fields require user input:
* **Notification SLA Requirement** is used to store the SLA time interval, such as 30 minutes.
* **Customer Notified** allows you to enter the date and time the customer was notified.

The remaining custom fields require no user input and are calculation fields only:
* **Notification Due By** will calculate and display the date and time the notification must be conducted by adding the Notification SLA Requirement field to the start time.
* **Actual Notification Time** will calculate and display the actual time taken to notify the customer by subtracting the start time from the Customer Notified time.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/sla-custom-fields.png')} alt="SLA custom fields" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

These custom field settings will appear in the Cloud SOAR Incident screen as follows:

Cloud SOAR's [Triage](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#triage) module ingests events via the Cloud SOAR API and can be used to triage events which may be unverified or have a low confidence level before they are converted to incidents. 

You can customize triage display preferences on the **Triage** configuration page. You can color-code triage events based on status to easily distinguish them from each other when viewing the list of triage events. You can also modify the name of the module from **Triage** to a name of your choosing. The new name will be displayed in all areas of Cloud SOAR, including the menu and logs.

* **Section Name**. The name you want to use for the **Triage** section of the user interface.
* **Disable background cache generation**. Prevent cache from being generated for triage events. Selecting this box may speed up page load, but slow triage event retrieval.
* **Set event row style**. Set the colors to display for triage events.
* **Reassign Mail Configuration**. Customize the content of emails sent to analysts when triage events are reassigned.

## Architecture

Sumo Logic Cloud SOAR provides Security Operations and Automation Incident Response Platform to facilitate and expedite timely management of Incident Response with a rich library of customizable playbooks for different threats and use cases of incident response scenarios expediting and automating response time to incident response events.

This solution additionally provides capabilities to support incident
responders during the process of assessment, Investigation, data collection and correlation to help inference additional information and metrics analytics to see repetitive patterns when doing analysis. It facilitates documentation and knowledge transfer of information across the critical teams working on incident response and SOC operations team members.

Cloud SOAR Automation and Orchestration features help organizations from all sectors of the industry to manage measure and orchestrate security
operations tasks including incident qualification, triage and
escalation, threat hunting, analysis, threat containment and
remediation. The gathering of information from different data sources
and correlating this information expedites the capabilities and augments
human analyst available resources.

The Cloud SOAR tool offers standard management of Incident response events across different teams in the organization with the help of the R3 Rapid response playbook engine. R3 Playbooks are created using a Visual editor supporting granular, stateful and conditional workflows to orchestrate, automate and standardize best practices on a case by case incident response events activities like incident triage, stakeholder notification, data and context enrichment, remediation and threat containment.

Cloud SOAR has been designed with Interoperability for Cybersecurity Industry standards regulatory frameworks to be able to receive data from a wide assortment of Cybersecurity industry vendors to enrich the available data gathered and correlated to offer better forensic analytics. Just to name a few of our quickly growing list of supported vendors: Palo Alto Networks, Cisco ThreatGrid and Umbrella, IBM Qradar, Splunk, McAfee, Encase Forensics.

Cloud SOAR design and architecture follows Cybersecurity Industry standards and regulatory frameworks, and adheres to best Industry practices to meet best Cybersecurity practices followed by ISO, GDPR, OASIS, NIST, Sec Regulations, and more.

Cloud SOAR offers a patent-pending Automated Responder Knowledge (DF-ARK) module which applies machine learning to historical responses and threats. It recommends relevant Playbooks, paths of action to expedite the process, and responses to manage and mitigate similar incidents with better response time.

Cloud SOAR provides static egress for Cloud executions. IP addresses can be entered into the allowlist. For a list of Cloud SOAR addresses by region, contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/support/s/).

## Automation Bridge

Cloud SOAR interacts with the platforms in your environment using a module called Automation Bridge.

Automation Bridge is a process running on a Linux-based VM (deployed inside the your environment) that interacts with your Cloud SOAR Instance and allows you to execute playbook actions on all the systems that Cloud SOAR is orchestrating in that specific environment. For more information, see [Automation Bridge](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-bridge).
