### System

* **Use Proxy**. Enter settings if you need to use a proxy for Internet access.
* **Sticky Alert**. Set the number of seconds to display an alert in the Cloud SOAR UI when an incident generates an alert.
* **Date/Time Format**. Set the date and time format.

### Incidents

Use these settings to configure how Cloud SOAR handles [incidents](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#incidents).

* **Duplicates**.
    * **Prohibit duplicate naming**. Select this checkbox to prevent incidents from being named identically.
    * **Default suffix for duplicated incident name**. Select the suffix to add to the end of incident names to differentiate incidents that are named the same.
    * **Use suffix on non-duplicate**. Use the selected suffix on all incidents, regardless of whether they are named the same.
* **Objects**. Gather objects, such as IP addresses, domains and email addresses, and add them to the appropriate object's section within the incident.
    * **Extract from**:
       * **Incident field**. Gather objects from the incident properties.
       * **Task field**. Gather objects from the incident tasks.
       * **Note field**. Gather objects from the the incident notes.
    * **Filename extension whitelist**. Enter filename extensions to allow when gathering objects.
* **Process Phase**. Configure phases for monitoring progress of incidents as they progress. Determine whether the phase is **Mandatory**, and the **Status** of the incident when the phase is reached. Select **Show Deleted** to show phases on deleted incidents.
* **Mandatory Closing Note**. Make a final incident note mandatory before the incident can be closed.

### Instant Messaging

Use these settings to configure authentication for an instant messaging service such as Slack.

* **Integration**. Enter the name of the instant messaging service to integrate with Cloud SOAR.
* **Bot Oauth**. Enter the authorization token for the instant messaging service.
* **Signing secret for verify requests**. Enter the signing secret for the instant messaging service.
* **Workspace**. Displays success or failure of the workspace connection to Cloud SOAR.

For additional setup needed for Slack, see [Configure Slack for Cloud SOAR](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#configure-slack-for-cloud-soar).

## Groups

A *group* in Cloud SOAR is a collection of users that can be added as incident investigators. When you have a number of users to add as investigators, adding a group of users is faster and easier than adding each user individually. In addition, you can assign everyone in the group the same profile (role), limiting them as incident investigators to only the rights that the profile gives them.

For example, let's say that you have a team of SOC analysts that share responsibility for investigating incidents. You can add all the members of the team to a group and give its members the "Analyst" profile. Then when you need to add the SOC analysts as investigators to incidents, you can simply select the group as the investigator.

### Create a group

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). Click the gear icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-settings-icon.png')} alt="Settings menu icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> in the top right, select **Settings**, and on the left menu select **User Management > Groups**.<br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). In the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then under **Cloud SOAR Settings** select **Groups**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Groups**.
1. The **Groups** dialog displays. Click the **+** icon next to **Groups**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-groups.png')} alt="Groups dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/><br/>The **Add Groups** dialog is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-add-group.png')} alt="Add Group dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. In **Name** enter a name for the group.
1. In **Profile** select the role to assign to members of the group. These are [roles](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/) already created in the system.
1. Click **Create**. The empty group is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-example-group.png')} alt="Example group" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. Click the **+** icon next to **Members**.
1. Select the users to add to the group.
1. Click **Apply**. 

### Assign a group as an incident investigator

To add a group as an incident investigator, follow the same steps as described in [Add investigators](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#add-investigators):
1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). At the top of the screen, click **Incidents**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Cloud SOAR > Incidents**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Incidents**.  
1. Check the incidents you want to add investigators to.
1. Click the three-dot kebab menu in the upper left-hand corner of the screen.
1. Select **Add Investigator**.<br/>The **Add Investigator** screen is displayed. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-add-investigator.png')} alt="Add Investigator dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Select the group to add as investigator of the selected incidents. For example, in the sample screen above, select **SOC Team**.
   :::note
   The **Role** column displays the profile assigned to the members of the group. You cannot change the group's assigned profile (role) here like you can for individual users. You can only change the group's assigned profile on the group itself.
   :::
1. Click **Apply**. The group is added an investigator of the selected incidents. While investigating the incidents, members of the group have the rights given by the the role (profile) assigned to members of the group.

### Group role assignments

The role specified in an assigned group profile supersedes the user's [role assignments in the Sumo Logic Log Analytics Platform](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/add-remove-users-role/). The group permissions are persistent until the user leaves the group, the profile is removed from the group, or the group is deleted.

| User | Result |
| :-- | :-- |
| In a group | Has the assigned group role (profile) |
| In multiple groups |  Has the sum of the roles (profiles) from all the groups it is a member of |
| Not in a group | Has role assignments as assigned in the core platform |
| In group without a role (profile) | Has role assignments as assigned in the core platform |

## Notifications

[**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). To access notification settings, click the gear icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-settings-icon.png')} alt="Settings menu icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> in the top right, select **Settings**, and on the left menu select **Notifications > Event Triggers**.

[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). To access notification settings, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then under **Cloud SOAR Settings** select **Notifications**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Notifications**.


<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-event-triggers.png')} alt="Events Triggers dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

Select the icon to the right of an event to trigger a notification to be sent when that event occurs.

## Custom fields

[**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). To access custom fields settings, click the gear icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-settings-icon.png')} alt="Settings menu icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> in the top right, select **Settings**, and on the left menu select **Customization > Fields**.

[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). To access custom field settings, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then under **Cloud SOAR Configurations** select **Fields**.


<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-custom-fields.png')} alt="Cloud SOAR custom fields page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

The **Custom Fields** page allows you to customize all fields within the Cloud SOAR platform to better suit your environment. All fields are pre-populated by default and can be revised with environment-specific variables by manually creating or updating the fields. To begin defining Cloud SOAR's custom fields, select a Cloud SOAR section from the list on the left-side of the screen to view all available fields. To edit an existing field, hover your mouse over the field and select the <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/image47.png')} alt="Edit icon" width="30"/> icon that appears next to the field. To add a new field, click the **+** button at the top of the panel.  

Tips for working with custom fields:
* For considerations when you create custom fields for triage, see [Triage field settings](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#triage-field-settings).
* You can rename or delete custom fields that you add. However, you can only rename default fields; you cannot delete them. Although you may delete a custom field, it will not increase the number of custom fields available. Since the deleted field may contain data that was entered prior to the deletion of the field, the custom field remains reserved. You can rename internal values, but only personal values (denoted by having a trash can symbol next to the entry), can be deleted from the section's custom fields.
* For each field, a name and a type will always be required. The only attribute of an existing field that cannot be modified once the field is created is the field Type, such as Text or Date.  
* Each section of Cloud SOAR supports different numbers of custom fields. The **Incidents** section, for example, supports up to 100 custom fields. The number of custom fields remaining will be displayed next to the section name at the top of the page.
* When you edit a field, the **Additional info** section allows you to provide additional information or context to the field, such as how the field should be used or where the data can be located.
* You can reorder fields in the **Custom Fields** section to change the order they appear on the Cloud SOAR screen. To change the order of the fields, click and hold on the six dots to the far left of the field name, then drag the field to its desired location.

A complete list of field types is listed below. Additional fields are required or optional depending on the type selected. For example, a text field allows an optional default value to be specified, while a list field provides many additional options.

### Custom field types

| Field Type        | Description                                                                                       |
|:--|:--|
| Calculation  | Perform a calculation between two fields or between a field and a static value. |
| Checkbox   | Checkbox. |
| Color Picker  | Interactive color picker to select a color. |
| Date | Date only picker. |
| Date & Time   | Date and time picker. |
| Email Address | Email address available to use in actions which require a email input.    |
| Filename | Filename available to use in actions which require a filename input.   |
| Hash | Hash value available to use in actions which require a hash input.  |
| IP Address    | IP address available to use in actions which require a IP address input.    |
| List   | Dropdown list.  |
| Multi Select List | Multiselect list box.  |
| Numeric Textbox   | Accepting numeric values only.  |

### Using custom fields for SLAs

Custom fields can be used to calculate any number of custom service level agreements (SLAs). This can be achieved using combinations of `Date`, `Date & Time`, and `Time Interval` type fields.

In the following example, custom fields provide information on the status of an organization's notification SLA. Two of the custom fields require user input:
* **Notification SLA Requirement** is used to store the SLA time interval, such as 30 minutes.
* **Customer Notified** allows you to enter the date and time the customer was notified.

The remaining custom fields require no user input and are calculation fields only:
* **Notification Due By** will calculate and display the date and time the notification must be conducted by adding the Notification SLA Requirement field to the start time.
* **Actual Notification Time** will calculate and display the actual time taken to notify the customer by subtracting the start time from the Customer Notified time.

These custom field settings will appear in the Cloud SOAR Incident screen as follows:           

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/sla-fields-on-incident.png')} alt="SLA fields on an incident" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

## Incident labels

The **Incident label** page allows you to define labels for different types of [incidents](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#incidents). When incidents are created by the system, incident labels are automatically applied to the incidents. You specify the incident label to be used for each incident type when you create [incident templates](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#incident-templates) and [automation rules](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#automation-rules).

To create an incident label:

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). Click the gear icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-settings-icon.png')} alt="Settings menu icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> in the top right, select **Settings**, and on the left menu select **Customization > Incident labels**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). In the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then under **Cloud SOAR Configurations** select **Incident Labels**.
1. Click **+** to the left of **Incident label**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-incident-labels.png')} alt="Cloud SOAR incident label page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>
1. Enter the following on the **New label** dialog:
    1. **Name**. Enter a name for the label. This name will not appear in the label itself.
    1. **Description**. Enter a description for what the label will be used for.
    1. **Value**. Enter a value for the label. The fields below will be appended to this label.
    1. **ADD FIELD**. Double-click the following fields you want to append to the label. They will automatically generate values:
        * **Day**. The day of the month.
        * **Month**. The month of the year.
        * **Year**. The year.
        * **Roman numeral month**. The month represented as Roman numerals. For example, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII.
        * **Counter**. A counter beginning at 1.
        * **Counter from**. A counter beginning at the number you specify. Replace the `X` in the field with the number to start from.
        * **Counter year based**. A counter based on the year.
        * **Counter day based**. A counter based on the day.
        * **Random six digit number**. A randomly-generated number.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/new-label.png')} alt="New label dialog" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>

## Triage

[**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/). To access triage configuration settings, click the gear icon <img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-settings-icon.png')} alt="Settings menu icon" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="25"/> in the top right, select **Settings**, and on the left menu select **Customization > Triage**.

[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). To access triage configuration settings, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SOAR**, and then under **Cloud SOAR Configurations** select **Triage**.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cloud-soar/cloud-soar-triage-configuration.png')} alt="Cloud SOAR triage configuration page" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

Cloud SOAR's [Triage](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage/#triage) module ingests events via the Cloud SOAR API and can be used to triage events which may be unverified or have a low confidence level before they are converted to incidents.

You can customize triage display preferences on the **Triage** configuration page. You can color-code triage events based on status to easily distinguish them from each other when viewing the list of triage events. You can also modify the name of the module from **Triage** to a name of your choosing. The new name will be displayed in all areas of Cloud SOAR, including the menu and logs.

* **Section Name**. The name you want to use for the **Triage** section of the user interface.
* **Disable background cache generation**. Prevent cache from being generated for triage events. Selecting this box may speed up page load, but slow triage event retrieval.
* **Set event row style**. Set the colors to display for triage events.
* **Reassign Mail Configuration**. Customize the content of emails sent to analysts when triage events are reassigned.

## Data retention

### Default retention periods by data type

Sumo Logic automatically deletes the following customer data according to the table retention period below, except for customers required to ensure HIPAA compliance (see second table).

| Data type | Retention period |
| :-- | :-- |
| Incidents | 2 years |
| Triage | 2 years |
| Entities | 2 years |
| Playbook and action executions | 2 years |

For HIPAA-compliant customers, we delete data following the retention periods below.

:::info
If you need to follow HIPAA compliance, it is important to explicitly communicate this when requesting Cloud SOAR activation.
:::

| Data type | Retention period |
| :-- | :-- |
| Incidents | 7 years |
| Triage | 7 years |
| Entities | 7 years |
| Playbook and action executions | 7 years |

### Custom retention periods

You can request retention period times different from those declared in the tables above, as long as the retention period requested is greater than 1 day yet less than 5000 days.
