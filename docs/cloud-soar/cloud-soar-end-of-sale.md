As of November 1, 2025, Sumo Logic will no longer sell its standalone Cloud SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) product. Sumo Logic will no longer sell Cloud SOAR as a separate licensed offering, instead focusing on delivering enhanced automation and orchestration capabilities through the [Automation Service](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/).

This strategic decision reflects the evolving cybersecurity landscape, where organizations increasingly prefer unified platforms over disparate point solutions. Sumo Logic's Automation Service, built on the same proven codebase as Cloud SOAR, are now seamlessly integrated into the company's log management and Cloud SIEM solutions, providing you with a more cohesive and efficient security operations experience.

## Benefits

The key benefits of moving from Cloud SOAR to the Automation Service are:
* **Unified operations**. Streamlined workflows between log analysis, threat detection, and automated response.
* **Enhanced integration**. Native connectivity between data ingestion, SIEM analytics, and orchestration capabilities.
* **Simplified management**. A single platform for security operations teams to manage and optimize.
* **Cost efficiency**. Consolidated licensing model reduces complexity and potential cost savings.
* **Accelerated innovation**. Focuses development resources on platform-wide automation enhancements.

### Commitment to existing customers 

Sumo Logic remains committed to supporting existing Cloud SOAR customers through this transition. Current implementations will continue to operate with full support, including security updates and technical assistance. Sumo Logic will provide migration tools and services to help you seamlessly transition to the integrated Automation Service when ready.

### Industry alignment

This move aligns with broader industry trends toward platform consolidation in cybersecurity. According to recent industry analysts, organizations are increasingly moving away from standalone SOAR tools in favor of integrated platforms that provide native automation and orchestration capabilities alongside their core security functions.

## Next steps 

Existing Cloud SOAR customers can continue to renew their current licenses and will receive detailed migration guidance through their customer success representatives. Organizations interested in Sumo Logic's automation capabilities should contact their account representatives to learn more about the integrated Automation Service available within the platform.

## FAQs

### Product strategy and business impact

#### What does the end-of-sale for Cloud SOAR mean? 

The end-of-sale announcement means that Sumo Logic is no longer selling Cloud SOAR as a separate, licensed product for our existing customers and new prospects.

#### Why is Sumo Logic announcing the end-of-sale for Cloud SOAR? 

We believe that almost every automation, orchestration, and response use case can be satisfied by the Automation Service already built into our log management and Cloud SIEM products. The cybersecurity industry is trending towards the removal of SOAR as a separate product, and we agree with that trend. The end-of-sale allows Sumo Logic to continue to focus on improving and innovating the Automation Service for every Sumo Logic customer.

#### When did this decision take effect? 

The end-of-sale decision is effective as of November 1, 2025. No new Cloud SOAR licenses are being sold from this date forward.

#### Will this decision affect Sumo Logic's overall security portfolio? 

No. This consolidates SOAR capabilities into our core platform, strengthening our security offering. Customers will benefit from tighter integration, unified workflows, and a more streamlined security operations experience.

### Current customer impact

#### What happens for customers who are currently licensed for Cloud SOAR? 

At this time we have only announced an end-of-sale of Cloud SOAR as a separate product. We have not announced any end-of-support or end-of-life for existing Cloud SOAR implementations. We will continue to support and update existing licensed customers.

#### What will happen when an existing Cloud SOAR license is up for renewal? 

Renewals are allowed currently as Cloud SOAR is not under end-of-support or end-of-life. We highly recommend planning a transition to the Automation Service already provided within the log management and Cloud SIEM products and discontinuing use of the standalone Cloud SOAR system before the renewal is required.

#### How long will existing Cloud SOAR implementations continue to be supported? 

While we haven't announced a specific end-of-support date, we recommend you begin planning your migration to our integrated Automation Service. We will provide ample notice before any end-of-support announcement, giving you sufficient time to transition.

#### Will there be any feature updates or enhancements to existing Cloud SOAR instances? 

We will continue to invest in the product and the Automation Service.

#### Are there any immediate changes to my current Cloud SOAR functionality? 

No, your current Cloud SOAR implementation will continue to function exactly as it does today. All existing features, integrations, and workflows remain operational.

### Migration and transition

#### How do I find out more about Sumo Logic's Automation Service? 

The Automation Service uses the exact same codebase and features as the Cloud SOAR product for playbooks and integrations. See [Automation Service](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/).

#### What's the difference between standalone Cloud SOAR and the integrated Automation Service? 

The core functionality is identical as they share the same codebase. The key difference is that the Automation Service is natively integrated into our log management and Cloud SIEM products, providing better data flow, unified alerting, and streamlined incident response workflows.

#### Will my existing Cloud SOAR playbooks and automations work with the Automation Service

Yes, since both solutions use the same codebase, your existing playbooks, integrations, and custom automations can be migrated to the Automation Service with minimal modifications.

#### Is there a migration tool or service available to help transition from Cloud SOAR to the Automation Service? 

We are developing migration tools and services to help customers transition smoothly. Contact your Customer Success Manager for details about available migration assistance and timeline.

#### What documentation or training is available for the transition? 

Comprehensive documentation is available for the [Automation Service](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/). We're also developing specific migration guides and will offer training sessions for customers transitioning from standalone Cloud SOAR.

#### Will the migration process cause any downtime for our security operations? 

We're designing the migration process to minimize operational impact. The transition can typically be done in phases, allowing you to maintain security operations continuity throughout the process.

### Pricing and licensing

#### How will pricing change when moving from Cloud SOAR to the Automation Service? 

The Automation Service is included with our log management and Cloud SIEM products, potentially reducing your overall licensing costs. Contact your account representative for specific pricing details based on your current configuration.

#### Can I get a refund for my unused Cloud SOAR license term? 

Refund policies will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Please contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss your specific situation and available options.

#### Are there any additional costs associated with using the Automation Service instead of Cloud SOAR? 

The Automation Service is included in our core platform offerings. However, you may need appropriate log management or Cloud SIEM licensing if you don't already have it. Your account team can help assess any licensing requirements. Also there is a limitation in the total number of [actions the Automation Service can handle per hour](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/about-automation-service/#actions-limit). If you are a heavy user of actions across multiple playbooks and integrations, please check your action rate to see if you need additional capacity.

### Technical and integration

#### Will my current third-party integrations continue to work? 

Yes, the Automation Service supports the same integrations as Cloud SOAR. Your existing third-party tool connections and APIs will continue to function after migration.

#### What happens to my historical data and case information? 

They can be migrated to the new system. We'll provide specific guidance on data migration procedures and any necessary data export/import processes.

#### Are there performance differences between Cloud SOAR and the Automation Service?

Performance should be comparable or better due to the tighter integration with our core platform. You may experience improved performance in data ingestion and correlation due to the unified architecture.

### Support and communication

#### Who should I contact with questions about this transition?
