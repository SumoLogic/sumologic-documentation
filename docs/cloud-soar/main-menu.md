Cloud SOAR is a pure web-based application which does not require an additional add-on or client to deploy. The main menu consists of all operational sections of Cloud SOAR, including Incidents, Triage (if enabled), Operations, and incoming Data Sources.

![main menu](/img/cloud-soar/image25.png)


## Home

The Home section is where all your current tasks reside. Here you can approve, decline, and close tasks as well as customize this section to display all tasks assigned to a specific user or group.

## Dashboards

The Cloud SOAR Dashboard layout renders data for quick comprehension
using a combination of graphics (e.g., charts, tables, graphs, and
visual indicators) called Widgets. The data is helpful to security
analysts tasked with incident handling and operational activities and
provides supervisors and stakeholders a summary overview from which to derive strategic information.

![Figure - Dashboard](/img/cloud-soar/image27.png)



Cloud SOAR's dashboards section is used to highlight the most important
pieces of data to the user or investigator who is logged into the
platform. This data is presented through the use of multiple widgets
that you can add, remove, and customize to include all data relevant
to your job functions and duties.

![Cloud Soar Dashboard](/img/cloud-soar/image131.png)


To begin customizing the dashboard select the **Customize** button on the top of the screen. Once selected, a new configuration box will be displayed.

![Dashboard Widget Editor](/img/cloud-soar/image132.png)


![Dashboard Widget Configurator](/img/cloud-soar/image133.png)       


The widgets section on the left-side of the screen displays how the dashboard is structured. To begin adding widgets to the dashboard, click **+** on the desired section.

A new popup will be displayed with a list of all widget choices for the
selected section. To add a new widget, click **+**.

Once a widget is added to a section, they will be displayed on the
right-side of the screen. To configure, click the cogwheel next to the
widget to be customized. A new configuration screen will be displayed.
These configuration screens will vary depending on the information it
utilizes. Users have the option to add or remove filters and values,
rename the section, as well as choose what data they would like to have
displayed.

To change how the widgets appear in a section, you can drag and drop into the desired positions by clicking and holding the left-side of selection and dragging to a new location. Users can utilize Cloud SOAR's Carousel feature to cycle through different Dashboard displays on a SOC board to ensure constant visibility within the Cloud SOAR platform. Once the desired widgets have been added and configured, click save to commit.

![Cloud Soar Dashboard Carousel](/img/cloud-soar/image135.png)


Most widgets inside of the Cloud SOAR dashboard are drillable. To drill down into a specific statistic, click on either an Incident ID or a section of a pie chart to limit the information shown to the areas of concern.

:::note
Make sure to allow popups from the Cloud SOAR site to drill into dashboard statistics.

![Dashboard Pie Chart](/img/cloud-soar/image136.png)


You can also export Dashboards to an Excel spreadsheet or PDF document to include in reporting. To export a dashboard, select **Export** from the top of the dashboard screen and select which format to use. A new window will open with the requested document, which can either be saved to your machine or printed.

![Dashboard Menu](/img/cloud-soar/image137.png)


### KPI Reports

Besides exporting dashboard statistics, users can also build KPI
reports. To create a KPI report, click **KPI Reports** at the top of the
screen next to the Export functionality. A new configuration box will be
displayed.

![KPI Report Editor](/img/cloud-soar/image138.png)


The **Output Set** tab allows users to select the incident kind they wish
to run the KPI report for. The Output Set and Description fields allow
the user to set these values for KPI reports they wish to save and
generate again in the future.

The **Filters** tab allows users to filter the data which will be included
in the KPI report by any number of incident attributes.

![KPI Report Display Fields](/img/cloud-soar/image139.png)


The **Display** tab allows users to select which fields will be shown in
the KPI report. To include a field in the KPI report, check the checkbox
next to the field name to be included. Field order can be changed by
clicking on the six dots to the far left of the field name and dragging
the field name up or down.

The **Format** tab allows users to select various formatting options, such
as the sorting order and the file format (including PDF, PDF encrypted
with an encryption key file, and Excel). Reports can also be scheduled
to automatically run at a defined interval from this section.

Once the report is built, click **Generate** to run the report or **Save**
to create the KPI report template.

KPI Output Sets can also be generated using the Cloud SOAR API. Please see
the API manual for additional details.


## Incidents

All current and previous incidents can be found in the Incidents
section. Incidents can be sorted, filtered, and accessed here. <br/>![Incidents Section](/img/cloud-soar/incidents.png)

Opening an individual incident will allow you to interact with all aspects of the incident permitted by your assigned Incident Profile.

You can also add incidents manually from the Incidents section for
incidents which were not created automatically through another process.

![Figure - Incidents Section](/img/cloud-soar/image28.png)



### Triage

The **Triage** module ingests events via the Cloud SOAR API and can be used
to triage events that may be unverified or have a low confidence level
before they are converted to incidents. The Triage module can be
completely customized for use cases from financial fraud to network IDS
alerts.

![Triage Section](/img/cloud-soar/image29.png)



:::tip Triage Documentation
For more information, refer to [Incidents and Triage](/docs/cloud-soar/incidents-triage).

## Entities

The **Entities** tab provides access to data from across all incidents, as well as other information which can be stored within Cloud SOAR.<br/>![Entities Section](/img/cloud-soar/entities.png)

Observables from every incident can be found in this section, along with any enrichment data associated with these data types and the incidents they were reported in. You'll find all variables including artifacts related to an incident. Clicking on an entity in the entity list will display the results of any previous actions taken on the entity, or where in the incident the entity was extracted.

![Entity Details](/img/cloud-soar/image163.png)   


A timeline of actions taken on the entity can be displayed on the far right-hand corner of the screen by clicking on the stopwatch symbol. Hover over the date tabs to expand the timeline and see additional information about the actions taken on each date.

![latest actions](/img/cloud-soar/image164.png)       


While any observable is selected, a menu bar will be available in the
top right-hand corner of the screen which allows users to perform
certain actions on the observable.

![Observables Menu Bar](/img/cloud-soar/image165.png)


- **Lock**: Lock the observable to prevent any actions from being taken on it. This may be useful if you want to ensure that no enrichment actions are taken on attacker-controlled infrastructure or that an observable is not accidentally blocked.
- **Delete**: Delete the observable.
- **Mark as Favorite**: Mark the observable as a favorite and move it to the top of the observables list.

### Adding a New Entity

To add a new entity, click the **+** sign at the top of the screen and a
new configuration box will be displayed. Select an entity type from the
dropdown menu and an additional configuration box will be displayed.
This configuration box allows the user to input information about the
entity, such as adding a file or its file hash. Once the entity is
created, click **Create** to continue.

![Adding a New entity](/img/cloud-soar/image166.png)         


### Documentation

The **Documentation** section provides investigators with an area to
document all steps taken during an incident's investigation. The
following tools are available across the entire Cloud SOAR platform as well
as on an individual incident level:

### Activity Log

Cloud SOAR records a detailed audit log of all activity that is performed during an incident. A timeline of incident activity can be viewed in the incident Timeline section. Each incident has its own timeline and the events are classified under two categories: automatic if generated automatically by the system, or manual when created by the user.

To manually create a new timeline event, click **+Add New Event** from the top of the timeline screen.

![Add New Event](/img/cloud-soar/image170.png)

A new configuration box will be displayed. Title the event and choose
what category the event falls into. (Please note, these categories can
be edited under the Custom Fields section). Add any additional
information necessary and associate an existing knowledge base article
where applicable.

![Add New Event Screen](/img/cloud-soar/image171.png)       


Once the event is created, users will see an additional list of options to the right of the event, they are as follows:

- Use event data in reports
- Mark event has irrelevant
- Edit the event
- Export event details

### Attachments

The **Attachments** section is a repository for investigators to use to
house attachments related to an incident's investigation. The source of
this data can vary but will often be the output of monitoring tools and
supporting documents. For each record, users can define:

- **Reference**: an identifier for what the record refers to;
- **Date**: a timestamp for when the record was uploaded;
- **Application**: information about the system or application used to generate the record;
- **Short description**: a free-form textual description of the record; and,
- **Parent folder**: employed if arranging various records in a tree structure for logical classification.

As with our other documentation tools, attachments can also be added as
a timeline event and associated with a knowledge base article.

![New Attachment Screen](/img/cloud-soar/image172.png)         


### Final Incident Reports

The Final Incident Report section allows users to upload a
pre-configured basedoc to be used for final incident reports. Users can
choose to use an existing basedoc or upload a new one by selecting from
the basedoc selections at the bottom of the screen.

![Final Report Screen](/img/cloud-soar/image173.png)         


To add a new basedoc, click **Upload Basedoc** and select the template to
use and click **Save**. Once the document has been uploaded users can
choose which sections or tags to use in the report. These tags act as
placeholders which will be filled in with the incident's details each
time an incident report is executed.

![Basedoc Tag List](/img/cloud-soar/image174.png)


To add tags to the incident report, double click the tag from the
right-side of the screen and it will be added to the tagging section for
configuration. Once the tag is added, users can either edit the tag or
remove unnecessary ones before executing the final report. Once finished, click **Export Final Report** at the bottom of the screen.

### Custom Reports

Custom report templates can be defined by navigating to **Configurations** > **Customizations** > **Report Template**. The left pane of the Report Template screen contains a list of all current report templates. To add a new report template, click on the **+** icon above the report template list.

The Details tab of the new report template window allows the user to
specify a unique name for the template as well as a template category
and any appropriate tags.

The Sections tab of the new report template window allows users to drag
and drop sections of the incident in to the report template. All
incident sections are listed in the left-hand pane. Dragging incident
sections to the right-hand pane will add the section to the report
template. Sections will be printed in the report in the order they
appear in the right-hand pane.

![Report Templates](/img/cloud-soar/image45.png)            


Once a report template has been defined, it can be generated by
selecting **Custom Report** from the **Export** menu. Users may add a
password or watermark to the custom report, which may be generated in
PDF or Word Document format.

### Closing Note

Closing incident will result in asking a note for incident closing as below:
