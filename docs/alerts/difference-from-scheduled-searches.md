To understand the difference between Monitors and Scheduled Searches, it's essential to recognize the specific use cases each solution addresses.

## Scheduled Searches

Scheduled Searches address two primary use cases:

* Alerting about specific issues in your application. For example, you can create Scheduled Searches to notify you about a spike in the error rate for a service or a stopped process.
* Reporting specific insights from searches on a periodic schedule. For instance, you can schedule a search to run daily, notifying you about the Daily Active Users on your platform.

## Monitors

Monitors are specifically designed for the first use case: alerting. They offer additional capabilities such as auto-resolution and support for multiple notification channels. Any Scheduled Searches created for alerting purposes can be moved to Monitors, including [real-time Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/create-real-time-alert).
