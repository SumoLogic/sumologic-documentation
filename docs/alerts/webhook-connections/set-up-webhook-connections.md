description: Webhook connections allow you to send Sumo Logic alerts to third-party applications.
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

A Webhook is an HTTP callback, which is an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens. Webhook connections allow you to send Sumo Logic alerts to third-party applications that accept incoming webhooks.

For example, once you set up a webhook connection in Sumo Logic and create a scheduled search, you can send an alert from that scheduled
search as a post to a Slack channel, or integrate with third-party systems. In addition to an alert, you can include a link directly to a search and even a few search results (depending on the third party tool you're connecting to). There is no limit to the number of webhooks you can send from Sumo Logic, but your third party might impose restrictions. In addition, the payload of a webhook may be restricted by Sumo or the third party.

Along with a fully customizable webhook connection, you can quickly create webhooks for:

* [AWS Lambda](aws-lambda.md)
* [Azure Functions](microsoft-azure-functions.md)
* [Datadog](datadog.md)
* [HipChat](hipchat.md)
* [Jira](jira-cloud.md)
* [Microsoft Teams](microsoft-teams.md)
* [New Relic](new-relic.md)
* [Opsgenie](opsgenie.md)
* [PagerDuty](pagerduty.md)
* [Service Now](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/servicenow/set-up-connections)
* [Slack](slack.md)

Most services with a REST API should allow you to create a connection using the generic webhook.

:::important
If a scheduled search fails or times out, no data will be sent via webhook. In this case, you won’t see any notifications in the app you’ve configured to receive data.
:::

## Set up a webhook connection

:::note
To configure a webhook connection, you must have a Sumo role that grants you the **Manage connections** capability.
:::

The first step in integrating webhooks with Sumo Logic is to configure one or more connections, which are HTTP endpoints that tell Sumo Logic where to send data. You can set up any number of connections, depending on your organization's needs.

To set up a webhook connection:

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Monitoring** > **Connections**.
1. On the **Connections** page click the **+** button on the top right of the table.
1. Click **Webhook**.
1. In the **Create Connection** dialog, enter the **Name** of the connection.
1. (Optional) Enter a **Description** for the connection.
1. Enter the **URL** for the endpoint. This is generated from the remote system’s API.
    :::important
    Only HTTPS (`port 443`) and HTTP (`port 80`) URLs are supported. 
    :::
1. (Optional) If the third-party system requires an **Authorization Header**, enter it here. For more information, see [Example Authorization Header](#example-authorization-header) below.
1. (Optional) **Custom Headers**, enter up to five comma separated key-value pairs.
1. (Optional) Under **Alert Payload**, which allows you to customize how the alert notification will look, enter a JSON object in the format required by the target endpoint. For details on variables that can be used as parameters within your JSON object, see [webhook payload variables](#configure-webhook-payload-variables), below. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/connection-and-integration/alert-payload.png')} alt="recovery payload" />
    :::note
    Variables are escaped according to the JSON standard, meaning that they can be used in application JSON. 
    :::
    You can test your customized alert payload by clicking **Test Alert Payload**, which will fire a sample webhook call to the given endpoint.
1. (Optional) Under **Recovery Payload**, which allows you to customize how the recovery notification will look, enter a JSON object in the format required by the target webhook URL.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/connection-and-integration/recovery-payload.png')} alt="recovery payload" /><br/>Example:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/connection-and-integration/recovery-payload-example.png')} alt="recovery payload" /><br/>Clicking **Test Alert + Recovery Payload** will test your recovery alert payload by firing a sample webhook call to the given endpoint.
1. Click **Save**.
1. When you're ready, create a [scheduled search](schedule-searches-webhook-connections.md) to send alerts to this connection.

## Configure Webhook payload variables

Variables are used as parameters in the JSON payload object of your alert notifications. These variables are used to dynamically populate specific values from the alert configuration in the notification payload. It includes things like the TriggerType that gives the current monitor status in the notification. When a notification is sent variables are replaced with values from the alert. For example, if you specified `{{Name}}` in your JSON payload, it would be replaced with the actual name of the alert in the delivered payload.

:::note
Variables must be enclosed by double curly brackets.
:::

### Common variables for alerts
You can use variables to customize your notification payload from Monitors and Scheduled Searches. The table below shows a list of variables along with information on which area of the product these are supported. We have also provided a brief description of each of the variables.

                     "value": "{{TriggerTimeRange}}"
                 }
             ],
             "mrkdwn_in": ["text", "pretext"],
             "color": "#29A1E6"
         }
     ]
}
```

#### PagerDuty payload

```json
{
    "service_key": "xxxxx",
    "event_type": "trigger",
    "description": "Monitor Alert on {{Name}}",
    "client": "Sumo Logic",
    "details": {
        "name": "{{Name}}",
        "query": "<{{QueryURL}} | {{Query}}>",
        "time": "{{TriggerTimeRange}} -- {{TriggerTime}} --"
    }
}
```

#### Email message

```
Monitor Alert: {{TriggerTimeRange}} on {{Name}}
```



#### Flat JSON

This example payload is flat JSON. 

```json
{
    "text": "{{Name}} ran over {{TimeRange}} at {{FireTime}}",
    "results": "{{ResultsJson}}",
     "num": "{{NumQueryResults}}"
}
```

#### Hierarchical JSON

This example payload is hierarchical JSON. 

```json
{ "event_type": "trigger",
    "description": "{{Description}}",
    "client": "Sumo Logic",
    "client_url": "{{SearchQueryUrl}}",
    "details": {
        "name: {{Name}}, time: {{TimeRange}}--{{FireTime}}, num: {{NumQueryResults}}, results: {{ResultsJson}}"
    }
}
```

### Example payload fields

All variables must be enclosed in quotes to be interpreted as valid JSON. 

:::note
You can validate your JSON at sites like [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com).
:::

For the following example message:

```json
{
   "thread": "conciergePartitioner-1",
   "user_id": "",
   "user_name": "",
   "web_session": "",
   "Message": "2015-10-27 10:31:15,853 -0700 INFO Partitioned 0 tokens, 2 targets into 773 assignments"
}
```

the following is the payload configuration. Notice that `RawResultsJson` is enclosed in quotes.

```json
{
   "channel": "ops",
   "text": "{{ResultsJson}}"
}
```

The following valid JSON is sent in the payload of the POST request.

```
{"channel": "ops", "text": "{\"thread\":\"conciergePartitioner-1\",\"user_id\":\"\",\"user_name\":\"\",\"web_session\":\"\",\"Message\":\"2015-10-27 10:31:15,853 -0700 INFO Partitioned 0 tokens, 2 targets into 773 assignments\"}
```

### Example authorization header

Use HTTP Basic Authentication, this is a standard used across the world wide web, Sumo Logic doesn't require anything different or special. The username and password are concatenated, base64-encoded, and passed in the `Authorization` HTTP header. The Authorization field is constructed as follows:

* Combine the username and password with a single colon.
* Encode using the [RFC2045-MIME](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt) variant of Base64. You can use any encoder, including the [base64](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/base64encode) search operator to do this.
* The authorization method and a space, such as "Basic " is then put before the encoded string.

For example, if the user agent uses `Aladdin` as the username and `OpenSesame` as the password then the field could be formed with a
simple bash command as follows:
```bash
echo -n "Aladdin:OpenSesame" | base64
```

:::tip
The `-n` ensures that an extra new line is not encoded.
:::

yielding a string 'QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l' that is used like this:
```
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

So in the **Authentication Header** field, you would enter: 
```
Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

## Test a connection

After configuring the connection, click the **Test Connection** button at the bottom left of the **Payload** area. If the connection is made, you will see a 200 OK response message.

This test does not use the same static IP addresses that send notifications, it uses different temporary IP addresses.

![test connection button.png](/img/connection-and-integration/test-connection-button.png)

If the connection is successful, you'll see a message appearing in the third-party tool. This won't contain any information from the scheduled search, it will just have the text in the payload.

### Troubleshooting Webhook payload

If the integration is not working as expected, there shall be a payload issue. You shall need to troubleshoot the generated payload. Here are some HTTP debugging tools that shall help you capture the generated payload and troubleshoot.

* [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/). Helps troubleshoot HTTP payload and configuration issues when working with webhooks and HTTP POST requests. You can inspect the JSON payload in real-time, enabling you to gain insights into the data being sent and received. 
* [Request Inspector](https://requestinspector.com/). Helps you in capturing HTTP requests and responding with `200 OK`. You can review the raw payload and find discrepancies between actual and expected. 

## Editing and deleting connections

If a connection is changed, all scheduled searches that link to the connection are changed moving forward. No changes are made to previous searches.

If a connection is deleted, the searches sent to those connections are not deleted. To delete these searches, use the Library.
