title: Does Sumo Logic let me get alerts from a specific static IP address?

Yes, Sumo Logic provides webhook notifications through static IP addresses. You can allowlist those IP addresses to receive notifications directly from Sumo Logic. For a list of our allowlist addresses, contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/hc/en-us).

:::note
The [Test Connection feature for webhooks](../../../manage/connections-and-integrations/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections.md) does not use the same static IP addresses that send notifications, it uses different temporary IP addresses.
