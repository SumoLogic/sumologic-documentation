This page has information about creating a scheduled search that will trigger a Cloud SIEM signal. Before you start using Scheduled Searches to create Cloud SIEM signals, it is helpful to understand what signals are, and how they relate to the generation of Cloud SIEM insights. For information about how it all works see [Insight Generation Process](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/insight-generation-process/). 

:::note
For a more detailed description of the options you can configure for a scheduled search, see [Create a Scheduled Search](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/schedule-search/).

## Requirements for the search query

This section describes the requirements for your scheduled search, which include a minimum set of fields to be returned, and renaming message fields as necessary to match attribute names in the selected Cloud SIEM record type schema.  

### Required fields

There are several fields that your scheduled search must return to
enable signal generation:

* `normalizedseverity`. This field must contain a value between (and including) 0 and 10. Signals generated by the scheduled search will have this severity value. SIgnal severity values are used by Cloud SIEM’s insight generation algorithm, as described above. 
* `stage`. This field must contain a Tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, one of the following:
  * Collection
  * Command and Control
  * Credential Access
  * Defense Evasion
  * Discovery
  * Execution
  * Exfiltration
  * Impact
  * Initial Access
  * Lateral Movement
  * Persistence
  * Privilege Escalation
  * Reconnaissance
  * Resource Development
    :::important
    If the `stage` field contains a Tactic that isn't in the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a signal will not be generated, but a record will be. 
    :::
* At least one entity field:

  * `device_ip`
  * `device_mac`
  * `device_natIp`
  * `dns_replyIp`
  * `dstDevice_hostname`
  * `dstDevice_ip`
  * `dstDevice_mac`
  * `dstDevice_natIp`
  * `fromUser_username`
  * `srcDevice_hostname`
  * `srcDevice_ip`
  * `srcDevice_mac`
  * `srcDevice_natIp`
  * `user_username`        

### Renaming message fields

When you configure a Scheduled Search to create Cloud SIEM signals, you are prompted to select a [Cloud SIEM record type](/docs/cse/schema/cse-record-types/). The fields returned by your search must match an attribute in the record type you select. A field whose name does not match a Cloud SIEM attribute will not be populated in the record created from the Schedule Search results. For more about Cloud SIEM attribute names, see [Attributes You Can Map to Records](/docs/cse/schema/attributes-map-to-records/).

## Scheduling the search

1. After creating and saving your search, click the save icon.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/save-as.png')} alt="Save the search" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
1. The **Save Item** popup appears.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/save-item.png')} alt="Save as scheduled search" width="500"/>
   :::note
   The name of your scheduled search will appear as the signal name in Cloud SIEM.
   :::
1. Click **Schedule this search**.
1. The **Save Item** popup prompts you to select a run frequency.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/run-freq-signal-gen.png')} alt="Run frequency" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />
1. Select a frequency from the pull-down list and click **Save**.  Scheduling a run frequency that matches your query time range will reduce overlapping searches and duplicate alerts. When you have a search scheduled to run over the same results as a previously scheduled search you would trigger an alert on the same data. 
1. The popup refreshes.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/options.png')} alt="Options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. **Time range for scheduled search.** Indicates the time range your query will use to execute, which impacts the results generated by the query.
   :::note
   This setting is different than the time range option configured for the Saved Search. The first time range is only used when you run the Saved Search from the library. This time range applies to your Scheduled Search.
   :::
1. **Timezone for scheduled search**. Select the time zone you would like your scheduled search to use. The schedule's time is based on this time zone. This time zone is not related to the time zone of your data. If you do not make a selection, the scheduled search will use the time zone from your browser, which is the default selection.
1. **Send Notification**. Select **If the following condition is met**, and enter an alert condition and the number of results that should trigger the alert.
1. **Alert Type**. Select **CSE Signal**.
1. The popup refreshes.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/alert-type-selected.png')} alt="Alert type selected" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
1. **Record Type**. Select a [record type](/docs/cse/schema/cse-record-types/).
1. Click **Save**.

## View signals in Cloud SIEM

To view signals that were created from a scheduled search, run a keyword search on “Scheduled Search” on the **Signals** page in the Cloud SIEM UI:
1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Cloud SIEM**, and then select **Signals** in the top menu. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Cloud SIEM > Signals**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Signals**.
1. Click in the **Filters** field at the top of the screen.
1. Type **Scheduled Search** and press Enter. The keyword search returns a list of all signals created by scheduled searches.
1. Click a signal from the list. Below is a screenshot of a signal that was created from a scheduled search. Note that:
   * **Related Insights** shows the insights the signal is included with. If the signal is not part of an insight, there’s a **Create Insight** link you can use to create an insight for the signal. For more information, see [Create an insight from signal](#create-an-insight-from-signal).
   * You can click the **Full Details** link for more information about the signal. See [View signal details](#view-signal-details) below for a screenshot.
   * The **Mapping** section at the bottom of the page shows that the signal was the result of a scheduled search.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/ss-signal.png')} alt="Signal" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

## View signal details

The **Full Details** tab displays details about the signal.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/full-details.png')} alt="Signal details" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

## Create an insight from signal

To create an insight from a signal generated from a scheduled search:

1. Navigate to a signal that was generated from a scheduled search.
1. **Related Insights** shows the insights the signal is included with. If the signal is not part of an insight, there’s a **Create Insight** link you can use to create an insight for the signal. Click **Create Insight**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/create-insight.png')} alt="Create insight link" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Click **Yes, Create Insight**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/confirm-create.png')} alt="Confirm create" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />
1. The new insight is created and appears as a **Related Insight**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/new-related-insight.png')} alt="New related insight" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
