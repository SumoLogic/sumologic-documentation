description: Alerts support variables allowing you to customize notifications with the information you need. You can use alert variables to customize your notification payload from Monitors, Scheduled Searches, and Metrics Monitors.
---

Variables are used as parameters that allow you to customize the JSON payload object of your alert notifications. These variables are used to dynamically populate specific values from the alert configuration in the notification payload. It includes things like the TriggerType that gives the current monitor status in the notification. When a notification is sent, variables are replaced with values from the alert. For example, if you specified `{{Name}}` in your JSON payload, it would be replaced with the actual name of the alert in the delivered payload.

## Common variables for alerts

You can use the following built-in variables when specifying the notification payload for log and metric monitors and scheduled searches. They allow you to reference specific configurations of your monitor.

The table below lists the variable descriptions along with which areas of the product you can use them.

Variables must be enclosed by double curly brackets (`{{ }}`). Unresolved variables are given empty quotes `""` as a value. All variables are case-insensitive.

| Variable | Description | Monitors | Scheduled Searches |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `{{Name}}` | The name of the alert. In the delivered payload, this variable is replaced with the Name you assigned to the alert when you created it. | &#9989;| &#9989;|
| `{{Description}}` | The description of the alert. | &#9989;| &#9989;|
| `{{MonitorType}}` | The type of alert, either `Logs` or `Metrics`. | &#9989;| &#9989;|
| `{{Query}}` | The query used to run the alert. | &#9989;| &#9989;|
| `{{QueryURL}}` | The URL to the logs or metrics query within Sumo Logic. | &#9989;| &#9989;|
| `{{ResultsJson}}` | JSON object containing the query results that triggered the alert. A maximum of 200 aggregate results or 10 raw messages for this field can be sent via webhook. | &#9989;| &#9989;<br/>Not available with Email notifications |
| `{{ResultsJson.fieldName}}` | The value of the specified field name. For example, the payload specification `{{ResultsJson.client_ip}} had {{ResultsJson.errors}} errors` would result in a subject line like this: `70.69.152.165 had 391 errors`.<br/><br/>A maximum of 200 aggregate results or 10 raw messages for this field can be sent via webhook.<br/><br/>A field name must match (case-insensitive) the field from your search and must be alphanumeric characters, underscores, and spaces. If you have a field name that has an unsupported character, use the [`as`](../../search/search-query-language/search-operators/as.md) operator to rename it.<br/><br/>You can return a specific result by providing an array index value in bracket notation such as `{{ResultsJson.fieldName}}[0]` to return the first result.<br/><br/>**Reserved Fields**<br/>The following are reserved field names. They are generated by Sumo Logic during collection or search operations.<ul><li>_raw - Message</li><li>_messagetime - Time</li><li>_sourcehost - Host</li><li>_sourcecategory - Category</li><li>_sourcename - Name</li><li>_collector - Collector</li><li>_timeslice</li><li>_signature</li></ul> | &#9989;| &#9989;<br/>Email notifications only return the first result. |
| `{{NumQueryResults}}` | The number of results the query returned. Results can be raw messages, time-series, or aggregates.<br/>An aggregate query returns the number of aggregate results; displayed in the **Aggregates** tab of the [Search page](/docs/search).<br/>A non-aggregate query returns the number of raw results; displayed in the **Messages** tab of the [Search page](/docs/search). | &#9989;| &#9989;|

## Legacy Variables

This section provides the old variables available for alert notifications from Metrics Monitors and Scheduled Searches. The following table shows where the old variables are supported.
