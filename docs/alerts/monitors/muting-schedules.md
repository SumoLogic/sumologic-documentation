Setting a **Muting Schedule** allows you to pause alert notifications from monitors according to a schedule that you define. You can apply this setting to individual monitors and/or folders. For folders, this will mute all nested monitors and subfolders. Here are some scenarios where you might want to mute your alerts:

* **Scheduled System Maintenance**. During system maintenance, notifications can get triggered because your application and infrastructure are being brought up or turned off. Such notifications are known false alarms and should be ignored.
* **Off-Business Hours**. If your monitors reflect performance thresholds that are only applicable during business hours, such monitors might generate false alarms during off-business hours.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you've enabled the [**View Muting Schedules** and **Manage Muting Schedules**](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#alerts) user permissions, which allow you to define and edit a muting schedule.

If fine-grained permissions are enabled for your account, you'll need the **Manage Muting Schedules** and **Admin Monitors** capabilities. If not enabled, you'll need the **Manage Muting Schedules** and **Manage Monitors** capabilities.

## Set a Muting Schedule

To set a muting schedule:

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Monitoring** > **Muting Schedules** tab.
1. Click **Add** > **New Schedule**.
1. Define your **Schedule Configuration** using the provided UI or [*RRule*](https://freetools.textmagic.com/rrule-generator), a syntax that allows you to specify schedule recurrence rules for calendar dates programmatically.
1. Define your **Scope**, where you associate one or more monitors with this schedule.
1. Add a **Name** and optionally, a **Description**.

To confirm that your Muting Schedule has been applied successfully:
1. Go to your **Manage Data** > **Monitoring** > **Monitors** tab.
1. Find your monitor in the list and check the **Status** column, where you should see the muted indicator.
