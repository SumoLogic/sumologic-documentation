Alert Response provides contextual insights about triggered alerts to minimize the time needed to investigate and resolve application failures.

On-call engineers are tasked with firefighting production issues and recovering quickly. They have to investigate issues and try to identify the root cause and fix it, which requires deep knowledge about the production systems, troubleshooting tools, and tons of experience as on-calls. 

By assembling relevant context from prior alerts and by analyzing patterns in logs and metrics underlying alerts, Alert Response enables on-call engineers to cut down the time spent piecing together insights during an incident from various sources and accelerate recovery.

## Setting up Alert Response

Email alerts automatically get a button labeled **View Alert** that opens the alert on the Alert page, shown in the below image.<br/> ![view alert from email.png](/img/monitors/view-alert-from-email.png)

If you use [Webhook connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections) offered by Sumo Logic for receiving notifications, you'll need to provide the [`alertResponseUrl` variable](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-variables) in your notification payload of a Monitor to receive a link that opens Alert Response. When your Monitor is triggered, it will generate a URL and provide it in the alert notification payload, which you can use to open the Alert Response.

The following is an example Slack payload with the variable:
```json
{
	"attachments":[
		{
			"pretext":"Sumo Logic Alert",
			"fields":[
				{
					"title":"Alert Page",
					"value":"{{alertResponseUrl}}"
				}
			],
			"mrkdwn_in":[
				"text",
				"pretext"
			],
			"color":"#29A1E6"
		}
	]
}
```

## Alert list

The Alert list shows all of your Alerts from Monitors triggered within the past seven days. By default, the list is sorted by status (showing **Active** on top, followed by **Resolved**), and then chronologically by creation time.

To open the Alert list, click the bell icon in the top menu. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/alert-list-page-bell-border.png')} alt="alert-list-page-bell-border" width="300"/>

To filter or sort by category (e.g., **Name**, **Severity**, **Status**), you can use the search bar or click on a column header.<br/>![search alert list.png](/img/monitors/search-alert-list.png)

:::info Limitations
The Alert list displays up to 1,000 alerts.

### Resolve Alerts

To resolve an alert, click a row to select it, then click **Resolve**.

### Translating Thresholds

 Threshold translating allows you to open the Alert Response Page in the **Metrics Explorer** that helps you to easily view the threshold associated with an alert. This also helps you to understand how your monitor's thresholds are translating into metrics and compare the threshold values set in a monitor with the data displayed in the Metrics Explorer chart.

 For example, when you open an alert response page in Metrics Explorer, you can see critical thresholds defined with some number. You can then see that this threshold is also applied and enabled in the Metrics Explorer view, with exactly the same number defined.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/arp-metrics-explorer.png')} alt="arp-metrics-explorer" width="800"/>

 To view the Alert Response chart in Metrics Explorer, follow the steps Below:
1. Navigate to the **Alert lists** and select the alert for which you want to view the corresponding metrics and threshold values.
1. Open the **Alert Response Page**.
1. Click the **View in Metrics Explorer** button for that alert. You can click on either of the two buttons, and they both function the same way.
1. The Metrics Explorer view will open with the graph of the metric associated with the alert.
1. In the **Threshold** section of the Metrics Explorer, you can see the same threshold values for the monitor associated with the alert.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/alerts/threshold-metrics-explorer-view.png')} alt="threshold-metrics-explorer" width="800"/>
1. The thresholds will be enabled and only the ones that are defined in the monitor will be displayed.
   * If the alert has both critical and warning thresholds defined in the corresponding monitor, both thresholds will be displayed in the Metrics Explorer view.
   * If the alert has only a critical threshold defined in the corresponding monitor, only the warning threshold will be displayed in the Metrics Explorer view.
1. Use this feature to compare the threshold values set in a monitor with the data displayed in the Metrics Explorer graph and gain a better understanding of how your monitors are translating into metrics.

:::note
Note that the same threshold translating functionality supports to [Creating Monitor from the Metrics Explorer](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor/#from-your-metrics-explorer) and [Opening Monitor in the Metrics Explorer](/docs/alerts/monitors/edit-settings/#view-in-metrics-explorer).

## Alert Page

The Alert Page is where you can view granular details about an individual alert. To get to an Alert page, click on any row from your Alert list.

An Alert provides curated information to on-calls in order for them to troubleshoot issues more quickly. It provides two different types of information to help get to the root cause of the issue quickly.
* **Alert Details**. Overview of the alert that was triggered to help you understand the issue and its potential impact. 
* **Alert Context**. System curated context helps you understand potential underlying symptoms within the system that might be causing the issue.

### Alert Details

The details section provides:
* a chart to visualize the alerting KPI before and during the alert.
* a table with the raw data that triggered the alert.
* related alerts firing in the system around the same time.
* the history of the given alert being fired in the past.
* basic details about the alert like when it was fired and what triggered it.

The following images label each section of the page with a letter, see the list below the image for a description of what each does.<br/> ![top of the alert response page.png](/img/monitors/top-alert-response-page.png)

The top of the page provides several details and buttons.

* **A**. The title of the Monitor.
* **B**. Copy the link to the opened Alert page.
* **C**. The type of Monitor trigger condition that triggered the alert, either Critical, Warning, or MissingData.
* **D**. The status of the Alert, either **Active** or **Resolved**.
* **E**. Refreshes the Alert page.
* **F**. Opens the playbook associated with this Monitor. Playbooks allow admins to codify tribal knowledge for an on-call so they know what exactly to do when they receive an alert.<br/> ![playbook example.png](/img/monitors/playbook-example.png)<br/>
    You have the option to provide a playbook when creating a Monitor, as shown in the below image. Markdown is supported.<br/>  ![Montor playbook input.png](/img/monitors/monitor-playbook-input.png)
* **G**. Opens the Monitor that generated this alert.
* **H**. Resolves the Alert. This will also resolve the Monitor that generated the alert. The Monitor will fire again when the alert condition is met. <br/>
:::note
Sumo Logic will resolve the alert automatically when the recovery condition defined on the monitor is met. This behavior is not configurable - that is, you cannot prevent Sumo Logic from resolving a monitor. Although technically you can set a recovery condition that will never allow Sumo Logic to recover a monitor, this is not recommended because it will suppress unrelated alerts from getting fired.
::: <br/>![alert page sep 23.png](/img/monitors/alert-page.png)
* **K**. The red exclamation mark indicates the alert is still active and a white exclamation in the gray circle indicates it's resolved. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/monitors/k-label.png')} alt="labels" width="300"/>
  * **Related Alerts**. A panel with Related Alerts and the Monitor History. It shows other alerts in the system that were triggered around the same time as this alert. This information is helpful to know what issues are happening in the system and whether the current problem is an isolated issue or a more systemic one. There are two types of relations that a related alert can have.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/monitors/related-alerts.png')} alt="related alerts" width="200"/>
    * **Time**. Shows all the alerts that were triggered 30 minutes before or after the given alert that doesn't have another association.
    * **Entity**. Shows all the alerts that were triggered one hour before and after the given alert that happened on the same entity (node, pod, cluster, etc.). You can click the expand arrow ![expand arrow.png](/img/monitors/expand-arrow.png) to view the alert's trigger condition and the white arrow in the square ![open in new tab icon.png](/img/monitors/open-new-tab.png) to open the alert in its own Alert page.
  * **Monitor History**. Shows the past 30 days of similar alerts that were triggered by the Monitor (that generated the current alert). Monitor History can be helpful to determine how frequently an alert has fired in the past and if the alert is flaky. You can then quickly correlate whether the current problem is similar to a past one by comparing the information shared for the alert.
* **L**. The query of the Monitor.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/monitors/l-m-n-labels.png')} alt="labels" width="800"/>
* **M**. A chart that visualizes the trend of the metric that was tracked as part of the alert condition of the monitor. The visualization tracks the *before* and *during* trends of the metric.
* **N**. A table with the raw data that triggered the alert.

Below this, as you scroll down on the page, you'll see context cards covered in the next section.

:::info Limitations
* The Alert visualization, labeled **M**, is only shown for alerts less than 30 days old. 
* Related Alerts and Monitor History show the top 250 alerts.

### Context Cards

**Alert Context** provides additional insights that the system has discovered automatically by analyzing your data. The system uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to track your logs and metrics data and find interesting patterns in the data that might help explain the underlying issue and surfaces them in the form of context cards.

Depending on the type of data an alert is based on (metrics or logs) and the detection method (static or outlier), you'll see different context cards. You will see a progress spinner labeled **Analyzing alert content** at the bottom of the window when cards are still being loaded. It may take a minute for some cards to load.<br/> ![analyzing alert content.png](/img/monitors/analyzing-alert-content.png)

### Log Fluctuations

This card detects different signatures in your log messages using [LogReduce](/docs/search/logreduce) such as errors, exceptions, timeouts, and successes. It compares log signatures trends with a normal baseline period and surfaces noteworthy changes in signatures.

* **New**: Log signatures that were only seen after the Alert was triggered but not one hour prior to the Alert start time.
* **Gone**: Log signatures that are not present after the Alert was created but were present one hour prior to the Alert start time, such as **Transaction Succeeded** or **Success**.
* **Diff**: Log signatures whose counts have changed after the alert when compared to one hour prior to the Alert start time.

:::note
The Log Fluctuations card will only work with Log Monitors at this time. It is not rendered for monitors driven by Metrics.
:::

Use the **Open** button to view the Log Search that provided the Log Fluctuation insights. The box with an arrow icon ![open drilldown button.png](/img/monitors/open-drilldown-button.png) opens a Log Search pivoted on a given signature.

![log fluctuations.png](/img/monitors/log-fluctuations.png)

* **A**. The name of the card (Log Fluctuation) and a short description of what it does.
* **B**. A link to open the log query that populated the card, in the log search page.
* **C**. A summary of the discovered NEW, GONE, and DIFF signatures, and how many log messages belong to each type.
* **D**. The details about the identified log signature.
* **E**. A histogram showing how many log messages mapped to the given signature after the alert (red bar) and before (gray bar) the alert.
* **F**. Option to collapse the expanded details.
* **G**. Opens a Log Search filtered to the Log messages that mapped to the given signature.

### Anomalies

This card detects time series anomalies for entities related to the alert. These insights are powered by the [Root Cause Explorer](../../observability/root-cause-explorer.md).

Anomalies are grouped into [golden signals](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/). Anomalies are also presented on a timeline; the length of the anomaly represents its duration. <br/> ![anomalies .png](/img/monitors/anomalies.png)

* **A**. The name of the card (Anomalies) and a short description of what it does.
* **B**. Count of anomalies belonging to each golden signal type.
* **C**. A timeline view of anomalies with their start time and duration, the domain (e.g. AWS, Kubernetes), and the entity on which it was detected. Anomalies may be grouped based on connections between entities and similarity of metrics. For example, anomalies on EC2 instances that are members of an AutoScaling group may be grouped together. The count shown in each anomaly refers to the number of grouped anomalies.
* **D**. A link to view the anomalies in the **Root Cause Explorer**.

:::note
Only Anomalies with a start time around 30 minutes before or after the Alert was created show up in the card.

Click on the EOI to open the **Summary View** and **Entity Inspector**.<br/> ![entity inspector.png](/img/monitors/entity-inspector.png)

### Dimensional Explanations

This card analyzes log data and surfaces dimensions or key-value pairs that drove it to an alerting state. For example, the card below has identified that ~80% of the alert logs have the field **log.Error** with the value `could not retrieve cart: rpc error: code` and is therefore a recommended item to investigate. <br/>![dimensional explanation.png](/img/monitors/dimensional-explanation.png)

* **A**. The name of the card (Dimensional Explanations) and a short description of what it does.
* **B**. A link to open the log query that populated the card, in the log search page.
* **C**. Groupings of the discovered key-value pairs by the count of keys and the percentage of log messages found with the key.
* **D**. The key-value pairs in each group.
* **E**. A histogram showing how many log messages with the key-value pair caused the alert (red bar) and did not cause (gray bar) the alert.
* **F**. Option to collapse the expanded details.
* **G**. Opens a Log Search filtered to the Log messages that mapped to the given signature.

### Benchmark

Benchmarks refer to baselines computed from anonymized and aggregated telemetry data from Sumo Logic customers in domains such as AWS. If the telemetry values for your entity during an alert period are unusual compared to benchmarks, you may have an unusual configuration change or other backend issues. 

For example, the card below shows that `ServiceUnavailable` error is happening 32 times more often in your AWS account compared with other Sumo Logic customer’s accounts. This AWS error pertains to AWS API calls that are failing at a higher rate than what is expected based on cross-customer baselines. This particular error implies an AWS incident affecting the particular AWS resource type and API. <br/> ![benchmark card.png](/img/monitors/benchmark.png)

* **A**. The name of the card (Benchmark) and a short description of what it does.
* **B**. Count of unusual Benchmarks by golden signal type.
* **C**. Dimensional detail of the unusual telemetry value.
* **D**. Comparison of your telemetry value (red bar) against benchmarks computed from other customers (gray bar).
* **E**. Expand/collapse details panel.
* **F**. Opens a Log Search filtered to the Log messages that match the dimensional details of the telemetry value

## Subscribe to Alert Monitors

:::note Terminology
A _monitor_ creates an _alert_. Using the options below, you're subscribing to an alert's monitor.
:::

#### From your Alerts list
* Right-click on a row item > click **Subscribe**
* Hover your mouse over a row, click the three-dot kebab menu > select **Subscribe**
* Single-click on a row item > on the opened Alert page, click the three-dot kebab menu > **Subscribe to Monitor**

#### From your Monitors list
* Right-click on a row item > click **Subscribe**
* Hover your mouse over a row > click the three-dot kebab menu > click **Subscribe**
* Single-click on a row item > in the side panel (Monitor Details), click **More Actions** > **Subscribe**

#### From a folder

If a folder is subscribed, then all nested monitors and folders are automatically subscribed (“SubscribedByAncestor”).

For example, if you create a subscription on “Monitor A”, and then move it to subscribed “Folder B”, “Monitor A” will have two subscriptions because it’s directly subscribed and inherits subscription from its parent folder.

To cancel an inherited subscription, you need to remove subscription from a parent folder or move the monitor or folder into another location outside folder with direct subscription.

Click **Unsubscribe** to learn how to remove a subscription.

#### Example 1

```bash title="Initial state"
📁 Folder A ("No")
├── Monitor B ("No")
└── Monitor C ("No")
```

```bash title="Create subscription on Folder A"
📁 Folder A ("Yes")
├──Monitor B ("Yes (inherited from folder)")
└──Monitor C ("Yes (inherited from folder)")
```

#### Example 2

```bash title="Initial state"
📁 Folder A ("No")
