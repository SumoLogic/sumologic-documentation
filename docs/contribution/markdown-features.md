Docusaurus supports **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** and a few **additional features**.

## Front Matter

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). Every page should have an `id` used for sidebar navigation. The title of the page is the only H1 on the page.

```markdown
---
id: page-id
sidebar_label: Navigation title
description: One sentence about the page...
keywords: [important, words]
---

# Title of the Page
```

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `id:` | **Required.** Id for the page used in the sidebar and as the canonical link. Keep it short and only use dashes. |
| `sidebar_label:` | Optional, use a different title for the side navigation. Keep this title short. It does not affect the canonical link or page title. |
| `description:` | Optional, one sentence describing what the user will find in the page for searches. Otherwise the first couple sentences are used for searches. |
| `keywords` | Optional, array of metadata keywords to boost search results. Do not use the company name or some brands or words already heavily used in the page. That can reduce search strength. |
| `# Title of the Page` | **Required.** Only use one H1 for the title of the page. This title is used in navigation is a `sidebar_label` is not included.|

For full options, see [Docusaurus Markdown front matter](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-front-matter).

## Headings

Use hashtags `#` to indicate the heading level. You should not use H1 down in the page, this is automatically used for the page title when building the site. Link anchors automatically also generate.

:::important
Use these heading in correct order. Right after the H1 title you'd next have an H2, not jumping to H3 or H5. This affects search and SEO structures to search crawlers like Google. Malformed structures can reduce search and SEO for the page. Docusaurus carefully formats generated pages to ensure strong SEO.
:::

## H2 - Create the best documentation

### H3 - Create the best documentation

#### H4 - Create the best documentation

##### H5 - Create the best documentation

###### H6 - Create the best documentation

## Links

Regular Markdown links are supported, using url paths or relative file paths.

```md Links to files in the same folder
Learn about [release notes](release-notes.md).

How about [translations](./translate-documentation.md).
```

```md Links to files in other drives - relative path
Learn how to [sign up with Sumo](../get-started/sign-up.md).
```

## Asset Files

You can save images and downloadable files all to the `/static` folder. Using the files should not include `/static` in the link as Docusaurus builds and saves these static assets will be served from the `baseUrl` (or domain).

### Images

We recommend using .png for all images. Save these images in `/static/img`.

Add an image at `/static/img/` and display it in Markdown with alt text, file path of `/img`, and image name:

```md
![Sumo Logic logo](/img/sumo-square.png)
```

![Sumo Logic logo](/img/sumo-square.png)

### Downloadable Files

If you have static files for users to download, save them to the `/static/files` folder. These may include .json, .js, .doc, and so on. You link to the file using the file path of `/files` and file name:

```md
![Download this Terraform](/files/terraform/script.tf)
```

If a file is available from another public Sumo Logic repo, please link to that file instead as a URL link.

## Tables

Tables use plain markdown with one header, default left aligned columns, and multi-colored rows. You can use Markdown for links and images. To break up content, you can use `<br/>` for line breaks, HTML for

```markdown
| Column Name | Example Value | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Trace ID | ffaf2f69ee8ad0c1 | The unique identifier of the trace. |
| Root Service | api | The service that started the trace. |
| Started At | 07/27/2020 09:01:04.533 | When the trace started. |
| Duration | 12.582 ms | The amount of time the trace spans.  |
| Number of spans | 35 | A trace consists of spans. This number tells you how many spans are in the trace. |
| Duration Breakdown | ![breakdown](/img/apm/traces/breakdown.png) | Each color indicates a service. The colors assigned to services are always the same on your account. You can change the color in the span summary tab after clicking on the individual span in trace view.<br/>Hover over to view a percentage breakdown of how long each span covers in the trace.<br/>![span hover](/img/apm/traces/span-hover-view.png) |
| Number of errors | 0 | The number of errors in the trace. |
| Status | 200 | The HTTP status code of the trace. |
```

| Column Name | Example Value | Description |
| -- | :--: | -- |
| Trace ID | ffaf2f69ee8ad0c1 | The unique identifier of the trace. |
| Root Service | api | The service that started the trace. |

| Number of errors | 0 | The number of errors in the trace. |
| Status | 200 | The HTTP status code of the trace. |

## Emphasis

```markdown
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with 2 **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses 2 tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with 2 **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses 2 tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Lists

You can mix ordered (or numbered) and unordered (or bulleted) lists together.  Use extra lines and tabs (or 2 spaces) to move content under these bullets, including other bullets, paragraphs, images, and more. Be careful of tabbing over too far. A third tab will automatically render as code.

### Numbered Lists

Always start with `1.` for numbered, ordered lists. The generator will automatically number the list correctly when building the site:

```markdown title="Markdown Ordered List"
1. First ordered list item.
1. Another item.
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it is a number.
   1. Ordered sub-list.
1. And another item.

  More content for this entry. And a screenshot:

  ![span hover](/img/apm/traces/span-hover-view.png)

```

1. First ordered list item.
1. Another item.
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it is a number.
   1. Ordered sub-list.
1. And another item.

  More content for this entry. And a screenshot:

  ![span hover](/img/apm/traces/span-hover-view.png)

### Bulleted Lists

Use asterisks `*` for unordered, bulleted lists.

```markdown title="Markdown Unordered List"
* Unordered list line 1.
* Line 2.

  Content to show under 2.

  * Another set of bullets.
  * Here we go, another!
```

* Unordered list line 1.
* Line 2.

  Content to show under 2.

  * Another set of bullets.
  * Here we go, another!

You can configure your editor to always use this format for lists. For Visual Studio Code, configure the following settings:

* **Ordered List: Marker** set to *one*.
* **Unordered List: Marker** set to *.

## Code Blocks

Markdown code blocks are supported with Syntax highlighting.

    ```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
    function HelloDocusaurus() {
        return (
            <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>
        )
    }
    ```

```jsx title="src/components/HelloDocusaurus.js"
function HelloDocusaurus() {
  return <h1>Hello, Docusaurus!</h1>;
}
```

To highlight lines in the code, use `{#}` in the title line with lines numbers. This example highlights lines 2 through 6.

```sql {2-6}
_sourceCategory=reinvent/travel/checkout
[subquery:_sourceCategory=reinvent/travel/nginx
     | count by src_ip
     | topk(1,_count)
     | compose src_ip keywords
]
| json field=_raw "funcName"
| where funcname in ("process_cart","charge")
| if (funcname = "process_cart" , "Checkout", "Purchased") as funcname
| count by funcname
```

For a full list of options, see [Docusaurus Code Blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks).

### Import GitHub Repo File

To embed a code sample from a file in a GitHub repositiory, use `reference` in the code block with a link to the file. The code sample is embedded using the language with a link to the original file.

This code references a script file: ` ```bash reference`, for example:

```bash reference
https://github.com/ccaum/sumologic-solution-templates/blob/github_getting_started_guide/software-development-optimization-terraform/scripts/getting-started
```

You can use a link to a file embedding the entire file, or embed a range of code lines using `#L` and a line range at the end of the link, such as `#L105-108`.

## Tabs

Use the following code to create tabbed content. You can use Markdown in these tabs, including text, code content, images, and more.

At the bottom of the Markdown file, add the following code:

```markdown title="Copy and paste once into markdown file"
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

For each set of tabs, use the following code:

```markdown title="Copy and paste into markdown for each tab set"
<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="tab1"
  values={[
    {label: 'Tab 1', value: 'tab1'},
    {label: 'Tab 2', value: 'tab2'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="tab1">

Add content here for first tab.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tab2">

Add content here for second tab.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

See the following tabbed code examples:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="kinesis"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kinsesis Firehose', value: 'kinesis'},
    {label: 'Lambda', value: 'lambda'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="kinesis">

Setup a Source in Sumo Logic:

Navigate to Collection management (Manage Data > Collection)
Use an existing Hosted Collector, or create a new one.
Next to the collector, select “Add Source”.
Select “AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs”
Enter a Name to identify the source.
Enter a Source Category following the best practices found in “Good Source Category, Bad Source Category”

Deploy the Cloudformation Template to Create a Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream:

1. Download the Cloudformation template.
1. Open CloudFormation in AWS.
1. Create a new stack using the CloudFormation template you downloaded.
1. Provide the URL you created from your Sumo source.
1. Select an S3 bucket to deliver failed logs, or create a new one.
1. Click next.

Accept the IAM permissions, and create the stack.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lambda">

Info for the second tab would go here! Content can include markdown, code blocks, notes, and more.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Expander

Use an expander to collapse long content that can be searched but not displayed when loading a page. We recommend only using expanders for additional content and long code samples. Content required for instructions and steps should not be placed in an expander.

You can include markdown content in expanders including code samples, embedded videos, bulleted lists, and more.

```html title="Copy and fill out for expanders"
<details>

<summary>Title for the expander</summary>

Place long lists or lots of content in this section. The reader can expand/collapse as needed.

Add all content after Summary and before the closing details tags.

</details>
```


<details>

<summary>Example expander</summary>

Place long lists or lots of content in this section. The reader can expand/collapse as needed.

```json title="Code in a tip with line highlight" {11-16}
"overrides": [
    {
    "series": [],
    "queries": [
        "A"
        ],
    "userProvidedChartType": false,
    "properties": {
        "type": "column"
        },
    "unsafeCanvasJSProperties": {
        "bevelEnabled": true,
        "indexLabelPlacement": "inside",
        "indexLabel": "{y}",
        "indexLabelOrientation": "vertical"
        }
    }
]
```

</details>

## Admonitions

Docusaurus has a special syntax to create admonitions and callouts, including note, tip, important, caution, warning, and sumo. You can use markdown content in the admonitions, code blocks, links, bullets, images, videos, and much more.

    :::sumo Custom Title
    content.
    :::

    :::tip
    Use this awesome feature option.
    :::

    :::danger Take care
    This action is dangerous.
    :::

:::note
This is a note. Need to get started? Try the [templates](templates/template-doc.md).
:::

:::sumo Sumo Best Pratice
Highlight specific info, best practices, links, [training links](https://www.sumologic.com/learn/training/), and other information from Sumo specialists! You can change the title based on the content.
:::

:::tip
Use this awesome feature option. Here's an example of a [code block](#code-blocks) in a tip.

```json title="Code in a tip with line highlight" {11-16}
"overrides": [
    {
    "series": [],
    "queries": [
        "A"
        ],
    "userProvidedChartType": false,
    "properties": {
        "type": "column"
        },
    "unsafeCanvasJSProperties": {
        "bevelEnabled": true,
        "indexLabelPlacement": "inside",
        "indexLabel": "{y}",
        "indexLabelOrientation": "vertical"
        }
    }
]
```

:::

:::important
Use important for vital information. Try to always use a language in a [code block](#code-blocks), for example sql for queries.
:::

:::caution
This could note important and problematic information. [Admonitions](#admonitions) can help highlight!
:::

:::danger Be advised
This action is dangerous. Definitely recommend a custom title for danger [admonitions](#admonitions).
:::

## Embed Videos

You can add YouTube videos to any page with the following code. Just copy and paste the following code into your page. Replace the URL ID with the video id. You only need the `import Iframe` line once on the page.

```html
<Iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcbHoC1jZz4"
        width="854px"
        height="480px"
        id="myId"
        className="video-container"
        display="initial"
        position="relative"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay=1; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        />

import Iframe from 'react-iframe';
```
For example:

<Iframe url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcbHoC1jZz4"
        width="854px"
        height="480px"
        id="myId"
        className="video-container"
        display="initial"
        position="relative"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay=1; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        />

import Iframe from 'react-iframe';

## Resuable Content

You can create sections of content as markdown files in `/docs/reuse`.

## Generated Section Contents

To add a generated list of contents in a section, add this code to the file:

```markdown

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

## Guide contents

In this section, we will introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>

```

This is best used in an index file, including a list of all files and folders in that folder to the file. See any category file for a section in the site for how this looks.

## MDX and React Components

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) can make your documentation more **interactive** and allows using any **React components inside Markdown**:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`)
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '20px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '10px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      alert(`You clicked the color ${color} with label ${children}`);
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

This is <Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> !

This is <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> !

## Mermaid Charts

Mermaid provides sequence diagrams, charts, and more. Use these charts to detail processes, workflows, inheritance, and more. See the [Mermaid guide](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) for specifics and examples, and use the [live editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) to generate code.

See the following example code for adding Mermaid charts. You need to include the import line once per page.

```markdown title="Mermaid Example Code"
<Mermaid chart={`
	graph LR;
		A-->B;
		B-->C;
		B-->D[Example Label];
`}/>
import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';
```

<Mermaid chart={`
	graph LR;
		A-->B;
		B-->C;
		B-->D[Example Label];
`}/>

import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';
