# Contributing to Sumo

We welcome contributions for updates, new pages, tutorials, and more for the Sumo Logic Documentation site.

This guide provides information on our markdown, creating files, adding them to the navigation sidebar, and more.

Additional content will be added as needed. You can also learn more in our GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/wiki) and [Repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation).
