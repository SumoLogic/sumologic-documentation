Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sumo Logic documentation! We welcome contributions for updates, new documentation, tutorials, and more. Sumo Logic Documentation is an Open Source project available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation).

The docs in this section provide information on creating files, writing in markdown, using our templates, submitting pull requests and more.

For a complete guide to contributing, creating branches, using Markdown, and more, check out our [repo Wiki](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/wiki). You can also learn more in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation).


## Before You Begin

* You must have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) to contribute to Sumo Logic documentation
* You'll need to review and sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) upon submitting a pull request


## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways that you can contribute to Sumo Docs, beyond writing code. This provides a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

* For minor changes like a typo, bug, or code snippet edit, you could use the [Edit Page button](#edit-page-directly) or [submit an issue](#submit-issue-or-bug).
* For more extensive contributions, you can [clone the repo files](#clone-our-repository) to your local machine, make changes in a branch, and push a pull request for review and merging to the site.
  * **New content** of tutorials and sample code can be discussed with the documentation team in Discord and through submitted issues. We can work with you on the project.
  * **Updates** that you wish to contribute can be discussed with the documentation team in Slack, through submitted issues, and in pull requests. These include rewriting content, changing flow, adding a new topic or section, and deprecating content.

### Submit Issue or Bug

If you find a bug in documentation or site tools, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Abug&template=bug_report.md&title=) to our GitHub Repository. You can enter an issue through GitHub or from any page on the documentation site. To share your knowledge, submit a Pull Request with a fix.

### Submit Feature Request

You can request a new feature by [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3Afeature&template=feature_request.md&title=) to our GitHub Repository.

### Edit Page directly

While reviewing content on the site, you can click **Edit this page**, located at the bottom of each doc page, to directly update and submit changes through the GitHub repo website.

### Clone Sumo Docs Repository

Another option is to clone the GitHub repository and edit locally. This is common for developers, working with GitHub tools, Git commands, and code editors like VSCode or Atom.

:::caution Required Step
When you submit a pull request, you'll be asked to sign our Contributor License Agreement. We allow both individual contributions and contributions made on behalf of companies. We use an open source tool called [cla-bot](https://colineberhardt.github.io/cla-bot/). If you have any questions about our CLA, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/issues).

#### Fork and clone

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [sumologic-documentation](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) repository. Remember to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) and update branches as needed.
1. Review documentation guidelines.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

Use descriptive commit messages detailing the content updates you are entering for content. Mention issue or ticket numbers as relevant for work.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

For example:
```bash
$ git commit -m "Updating query for metrics"
```

#### Create and push a branch

1. Create a new branch from your cloned repo/fork using a name that best describes the work or references a GitHub issue number. For example: `<your initials>-tracing-update` or `<your initials>-apps-gitlab`
1. Edit or create markdown (.md) files in your branch. See [Create a Document](create-document.md) and [Markdown Features](markdown-features.md) for more info.
1. Commit your changes to the branch with a meaningful message.<br/>![pull request](/img/contribution/commit.png)
1. Push your branch to the repo/fork.

#### Create a pull request

Doc team members will review and approve your contributions using GitHub.

1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) after pushing your branch. If you see an option to **Compare & Pull Request** for your branch click this.<br/>![compare](/img/contribution/compare-pr.png)
   * If you don't see it, create a new [pull request](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/compare).
      1. Select `main` for the base branch. Select your branch for the **compare**.
      1. Click **Create Pull Request**.
1. On the Pull Request page, enter the following:
   * Make sure **base** branch is `main` and **compare** branch is the one you pushed.
   * Enter a title for the PR.
   * Include an issue number from GitHub or Jira, etc.
   * Describe what changed, new pages, updates.
1. Click **Create Pull Request**.<br/> ![pull request](/img/contribution/pull-request.png)

GitHub will generate a pull request for review. Doc team members will review, provide feedback, and approve. When approved, the Doc team will merge and update staging. Updates to production will be handled by the Doc team.

#### Pull Request Submission Guidelines

We currently cut branches from **main branch** for accepting documentation. As our processes refine and work expands, we may use the [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development content.

As Pull Requests (PRs) are merged to the main branch by the Sumo Logic Doc team, the content builds and deploys to a staging site. This can be reviewed and tested thoroughly on a server, rather than a local.

When all content is tested and ready for live, a Sumo Logic Doc team member can tag a release to build and deploy to Production. This site is live to the world to search, use, and read to learn Sumo Logic.
