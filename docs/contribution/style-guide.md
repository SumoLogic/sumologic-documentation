The Sumo Logic Style Guide is a guide to language at Sumo Logic, so that we can speak as one company with a unified voice, and know what we mean when we talk about our product. The Style Guide began as a document used by the Documentation team to make decisions about tone, voice, and word usage. We thought it would be useful to share with everyone at the company.

The Sumo Logic Style Guide is a living document. If you have wondered about the usage of the name of a component or feature in the UI, or any other word usage, and you don't find that term here, please add it. If you're not sure about the usage, just add a question mark. The Documentation team will look it up and add usage guidance. Likewise, if you disagree with any usage defined here, please let us know and we'll update as necessary.


### Tone and Voice

* We are clear, genuine, and trustworthy. We understand that our customers entrust us with their vital data and never make light about our commitment to data access and security.
* The reader should feel confident and informed. We should strive to engage our customers, and show them where to get additional assistance when needed.
* Describe Sumo Logic in a **professional** and **truthful** manner. Avoid generic, unsubstantial adjectives like "we're the best". Instead, illustrate these points by letting our product speak for itself.
* Avoid using a stiff, institutional voice. Instead, write with an instructive and conversational tone. For example, when linking to the support site, use terms like "Need help? Let us know" instead of "Please email our support personnel" to give our company a friendly face.
* Use the **active voice** whenever possible. (For example, use "Brutus stabbed Caesar," not "Caesar was stabbed by Brutus.")
* Our instructional content should be written at approximately the 8th-grade reading level, particularly in introductory sections. (Test content here: [http://www.writingtester.com/tester/grade_level.php](http://www.writingtester.com/tester/grade_level.php) for feedback on readability and grade level). Blog posts should be written at an 8th-grade level to maximize search engine hits (SEO).
* When explaining a process or procedure, clarity is critical. Edit words that distract or confuse. Put yourself into the reader's shoes and think about what actions you are recommended to them when an error message is displayed, rather than merely stating what went wrong. Example: "Could not create the user." vs "This email is already registered in the system. Please use a different email or contact Sumo Logic for assistance."
* We have a sense of humor! Conveying that we do serious work, but we don't take ourselves too seriously, makes Sumo Logic feel likable.
* We use the Oxford, or serial, comma. For example: "I had [eggs, toast, and orange juice](https://www.verbicidemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/why-i-still-use-the-oxford-comma.jpg)."

### Names for cool stuff in the UI

Not everything has an intuitive name, it's the very nature of working with a constantly evolving product. Here are the best names we have so far from the design team.

| What does it look like? | What do we call it? |
|:------------------------|:--------------------|
| x | Three-dot icon      |
| x | Navigation Menu     |
| x | Favorites           |
| x | Personal Folder     |
| x | Recents             |
| x | Library             |



### Patents and trademarks

Protecting our patents and trademarks is important to do correctly. We don't want to expose the company to a loss of trademark or patent just because we didn't list it correctly.

This is a partial list of trademarked terms, which should be capitalized exactly as shown below.

* Sumo Logic
* Big Data for Real Time IT
* Log Reduce
* Elastic Log Processing
* Push Analytics

Never use in the plural or possessive form.


### Tables and table formatting

Use the table icon in the MindTouch visual editor to insert a table into a page.

If you want the table to have a header row, right-click anywhere in the table and select **Table Properties**, and click the **First row** option.


### Screenshots

Capture screenshots using SnagIt in .png format. Use SnagIt's border effect to apply a gray (RGB 212, 212, 212) 4-point border.

By default, images that you insert into a page will be set to be "Responsive", as shown below on the **Options** tab for an image in MindTouch.

"Responsive" images are automatically resized for the type of device the reader is using. Generally, you should not change the size of an image in MindTouch.

There's an exception to this rule: you may need to manually change the size of a wide image that is near the top of the page. That's because MindTouch's responsive resizing doesn't take into account the page TOC that appears in the upper right of topic pages. So, if you include an image in the vicinity of the page TOC, the image will be pushed down to below the end of the TOC. This is almost always an issue on release notes pages, as we generally include a screenshot in each release note. If the image is too big, the page will look like this:

The solution is to resize the image to be 750 px wide. To do so in the visual editor, grab the upper right corner and size the image manually until it is 750 px wide. The height will adjust proportionately.  


### Masking sensitive information

We mask sensitive information, like user names, email addresses, IP addresses, and so on. In Snagit, use the shape tool to mask the text using solid gray,  (RGB 212, 212, 212).


### Callouts

Create callouts using the shape tool in SnagIt. Callouts should be red, 100% opacity, no drop shadow effect, 2 pts wide.
