After you have created a custom Dashboard (New) you may also want to share it with coworkers within your organization. This page walks you through these tasks.

Currently, you can only share a Dashboard (New) within your organization.

## Sharing a dashboard within your organization

Sharing dashboards allow you to extend the insights you gain from Sumo Logic with others within your organization. You can specify specific permissions for the user with whom you share the dashboard, as well as controlling the data that appears in the dashboard. 

When you share a dashboard, you specify the dashboard access rights for the users—View, Edit, or Manage. Dashboard access rights are described in [Available Permission Levels](/docs/manage/content-sharing#available-permission-levels).

You can grant the same access right to everyone with whom you share the dashboard. Or, you can give some users View access, other users Edit access, and other users Manage access. If you are going to grant different access rights to different users, be prepared with lists of users and the access level you want to grant to each.

## Dashboard sharing options

The following example shows the Share Dashboard dialog options you will use to specify with whom to share the dashboard and their access
permissions:

* **Share with specific users and roles**. This is where you select the users or roles with whom you wish to share the dashboard.
* **See who has access**. Lists the users and roles with whom the dashboard is already shared.
* **Shareable URL**. Shows the URL for the shared dashboard, with options for sharing the dashboard with filters and time range and filter settings.
