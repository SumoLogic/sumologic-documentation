# Link Dashboard (New)

You can link dashboards together to quickly view related data. Each
panel can have links to other dashboards. Links have options to include
metadata and time range. When you select a data point on
the panel you will have an option to click on linked dashboards. This
allows you to quickly reference other related dashboards to
investigate. 

1.  Click the **Add Dashboard Link** from the [general
    settings](Panels/modify-chart.md) menu when
    [modifying a chart in a
    panel](Panels/modify-chart.md).
