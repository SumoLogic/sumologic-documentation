You can link dashboards together to quickly view related data. Each panel can have links to other dashboards. Links have options to include metadata and time range. When you select a data point on
the panel you will have an option to click on linked dashboards. This allows you to quickly reference other related dashboards to investigate. 

1. Click the **Add Dashboard Link** from the general settings menu when [modifying a chart in a panel](./panels/modify-chart.md).
