To support receipt time, the Search Job API has a new parameter,[byReceiptTime](/docs/api/search-job#Query-parameters).


---
### July 6, 2018 - APIs
Techniques that manage load, like rate limiting and throttling, help keep the Sumo platform reliable and stable. Towards that end, a new Search Job API throttling limit was introduced today. Until now, search jobs were subject only to the global rate limit: each user is limited to four API requests/second. Now, to improve reliability Sumo is limiting the number of active search jobs for a given account to 200. To manage the number of active search jobs you can manually clear completed searches. For more information, see [Search Job API throttling](/docs/api/search-job#Throttling).
