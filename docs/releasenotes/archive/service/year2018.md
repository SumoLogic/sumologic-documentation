[CVE-2017-11428](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11428) - OneLogin’s "ruby-saml"

[CVE-2017-11429 ](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11429)- Clever’s "saml2-js"

[CVE-2017-11430](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11430) - "OmniAuth-SAML"

[CVE-2018-0489](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-CVE-2018-0489) - Shibboleth openSAML C++
