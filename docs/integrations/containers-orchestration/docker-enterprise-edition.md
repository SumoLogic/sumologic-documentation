Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE) is an industry standard container platform, running modern container orchestration engines such as Kubernetes behind the scenes. Docker EE is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build, ship, and run applications in production scale environments.

The Docker EE App facilitates monitoring and troubleshooting distributed microservice based applications running in Docker containers. The app enables you to correlate events across the Docker platform and application containers and detects anomalous patterns for faster root cause analysis.

The Docker EE App works in conjunction with the [Docker ULM App](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/docker-ulm) that monitors application container workloads running on the Docker EE platform.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Docker EE

This section has instructions for collecting logs for the Sumo App for Docker EE. This app works in conjunction with the Docker ULM App, and the first step is to configure collection for Docker ULM App. Then, since Docker EE uses Kubernetes for orchestration, you install and deploy the [Sumo Logic Collection Helm Chart](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection) for collection of Docker EE specific components.


### Step 1. Collect Logs and Metrics for the Docker ULM App

This section shows you how to configure log and metric collection for the Docker ULM App, which requires configuring two sources:

* **Docker Logs.** Collects stdout/stderr logs from processes that are running within Docker containers.
* **Docker Stats.** Collects metrics about Docker containers.

To configure log and metric collection for the Docker ULM App, do the following:
1. Follow the instructions to [Collect Logs and Metrics for Docker ULM](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/docker-ulm#collecting-logs-and-metrics-for-docker-ulm). Use the same `_sourceCategory` for each host on your cluster.
1. Follow the instructions to [Install the Docker ULM App](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/docker-ulm#installing-the-docker-ulm-app) and dashboards.

### Step 2. Deploy Sumo Logic Collection Helm Chart to collect logs and metrics

For details see [Kubernetes Observability](/docs/observability/kubernetes) and check the [Kubernetes Quickstart](/docs/observability/kubernetes/quickstart.md) for installation instructions.

#### Troubleshooting

If you get the following error while executing `kubectl`, your kube config is not wired correctly to UCP’s kube: `The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?`

Do the following:
1. Log in to the UCP Web UI (dashboard), navigate to your user account, and click **My Profile**.
2. Then click **Client Bundles >** **New Client Bundle** > **Generate Client Bundle**.
3. Unpack the **ucp-bundle-XYZ.zip** file on the Manager Node/Machine.
  ```bash
  unzip ucp-bundle-XYZ.zip
  ```
4. Run the following command.
  ```bash
  source env.sh
  ```

Assuming you have a Mac/Unix environment, **`docker`** and **`kubectl`** will work on your cluster as your user ID, as shown in the following example where the user ID is **admin**.

## Installing the Docker EE App

You configured two sources for collection, docker logs and docker stats, and therefore will specify two source categories when installing the Docker EE App.

To install the Docker EE App, do the following:

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library.**
3. You retain the default **App Name**, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
4. Select the following  options for the **Docker Log source.**
    1. Choose **Source Category,** and select the Source Category from the list.
    2. Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter,** and for the Docker Log Source enter the source category with the value from [Step 1](#collecting-logs-and-metrics-for-docker-ee) of the collection instructions, beginning with an underscore, for example: `_sourceCategory=docker`
5. Select the following option for the **Docker Platform Log Source**.
    1. Choose **Source Category**, and select the Source Category from the list.
    2. Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter,** and enter the source category specified in [Step 2](#collecting-logs-and-metrics-for-docker-ee) of collection instructions followed by “`/system`”, for example: `_sourceCategory=kubernetes/system`
6. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
7. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or another folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

## Viewing Docker EE Dashboards   

**Each dashboard has a set of filters** that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level.

**Each panel has a set of filters** that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.

### UCP Overview
