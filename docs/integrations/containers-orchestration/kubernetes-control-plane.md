The Sumo Logic Kubernetes Control Plane App manages the master node control plane, including the API server, etcd, kube-system and worker nodes. The App utilizes [Falco](https://falco.org/docs/) Kubernetes Audit events to monitor and detect notable or suspicious activity such as creating pods that are privileged, mount sensitive host paths, use host networking, and the like. Seamlessly integrated with the Sumo Logic [Kubernetes App](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes), preconfigured dashboards display resource-related metrics for Kubernetes deployments, clusters, namespaces, pods, containers, and daemonsets.

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a system that automates the deployment, management, scaling, networking, and availability of container-based applications. Kubernetes container-orchestration allows you to easily deploy and manage multi-container applications at scale.

There are two versions of the Kubernetes Control Plane app for:

1. Kubernetes 1.16 or later.
2. Kubernetes 1.15 or earlier.

## Log and Metric Types

The Kubernetes Control Plane App uses logs and metrics.

### Log Sources

* [Kube API Server Logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-apiserver)
* [Kube Control Manager Logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-controller-manager)
* [Kube Scheduler Logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#kube-scheduler)
* [Kube-System Namespace Logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)

The Sumo Logic Kubernetes app uses [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) to collect logs.

### Metric Sources

* Kubernetes API Server Metrics
* Scheduler Metrics
* Controller Manager Metrics
* Node-exporter Metrics
* kube-state-metrics

Metrics are collected using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) with [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).
For additional information on metrics options you can configure for collection, see [this document](/docs/metrics/kubernetes-metrics.md).

### Sample Query

```sql title="Control Manager - Event Severity Trend"
_sourceCategory = *controller*
| json field=_raw "log" as log
| parse regex field=log "^(?<severity>.)(?:[0-9])"
| timeslice 1h
| count _timeslice, severity
| transpose row _timeslice column severity
| fillmissing timeslice(1h)
```

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the Kubernetes Control Plane App

See [Sumo Logic Kubernetes Collection](/docs/observability/kubernetes/collection-setup.md) for instructions on configuring log and metric collection for the Kubernetes Control Plane App.

:::warning
Before installing the [Kubernetes Control Plane App](#installing-the-kubernetes-control-plane-app), you must set up collection for and install the [Kubernetes App](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes), which provides the services for managing and monitoring Kubernetes worker nodes.
:::

## Installing the Kubernetes Control Plane App

This section provides instructions for installing the Kubernetes Control Plane App, as well as descriptions and examples for each of the dashboards. The app installation process consists of the following tasks:

* Determining custom data filters for source categories
* Installing the app

All the dashboards are linked to the Explore tab and can be easily accessed by clicking the Cluster, in the left navigation pane of Explore tab.

### Step 1: Determine custom data filters for source categories

The [Sumo Logic Kubernetes Collection Helm Chart](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection) uses the [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) to collect and enrich logs.
All ingested log records will have certain built-in metadata fields set. One of them is the `Source Category` field, which can be used to specify custom data filters for this app.

To determine custom data filters for source categories, do the following:

1. Run a query similar to the following in Sumo Logic to determine the source categories. Use the Collector Name that you configured for Kubernetes collection.

  ```sql
  _collector="<Collector Name>"
  | count by _sourceCategory
  ```

  You should see results similar to the following:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/containers-orchestration/K8s_ControlPlane_source-categories.png')} alt="k8s" width="500"/>

1. Determine the custom data filters and source categories. The following table lists some of the sources created by
   the [Sumo Logic Kubernetes Collection Helm Chart](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection) in the left column.
   The Source Category column contains the source category you should configure for the sources when you [install the app](#step-2-install-the-app), or the source category that matches your environment based on the output of the query (from the previous step).

  | Source                           | Source Category                                                                       |
  |:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Kube Control Manager Log Source  | `kubernetes/kube/system/kube/controller/manager`                                      |
  | Kube-System Namespace Log Source | `kube/system`                                                                         |
  | Kube API Server Log Source       | `kubernetes/kube/system/kube/apiserver`                                               |
  | Falco                            | please see configuration for `sumologic.logs.container.sourceCategory` in values.yaml |

### Step 2. Install the App

Now that you have set up collection for Kubernetes Control Plane, you can install the App and use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.

To install the app, do the following:

1. Locate and install the app from the App Catalog. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.
2. From the App Catalog, search for **Kubernetes Control Plane** and select the app.
3. To install the app, click **Add to Library.**
4. Complete the following fields.
   * **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
   * **Data Source.**  For each the sources listed, enter a Custom Data Filter or Source Category, as follows:
     * For **Kube Control Manager Log Source**, leave **Source Category** selected, and enter the following source category: `kubernetes/kube/system/kube/controller/manager` or one that matches the source categories in your environment.
     * For **Kube-System Namespace Log Source**, leave **Source Category** selected, and enter the following source category: `kube/system` or one that matches the source categories in your environment.
     * For **Kube API Server Log Source**, leave **Source Category** selected, and enter the following source category: `kubernetes/kube/system/kube/apiserver` or one that matches the source categories in your environment.
     * For **Falco Log Source**, leave **Source Category** selected, and enter the source category according to configuration for `sumologic.logs.container.sourceCategory` in values.yaml.
5. **Advanced**. Select the location in the library (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
6. Click **Add to Library**.

## Viewing Kubernetes Control Plane Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).
:::

### API Server

The **Kubernetes - API Server** dashboard displays information on the API server logs, which is the control plane component that exposes the Kubernetes API. Panels show details on the API server errors, warnings, and activities.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor the health and performance of the API server.
* Review server request rates.
* Review server success and failure request rates.
* Review client activity.
* Review server errors for troubleshooting insights.
