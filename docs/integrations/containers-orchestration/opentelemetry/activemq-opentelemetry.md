The **ActiveMQ** app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health, and resource utilization of your ActiveMQ messaging clusters. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into cluster status, nodes, producers, consumers, destinations, resource utilization, message rates, and error logs.


We use the OpenTelemetry collector for ActiveMQ metrics and logs collection.

The diagram below illustrates the components of the ActiveMQ collection for each ActiveMQ broker node. OpenTelemetry collector runs on the same host as ActiveMQ broker, and uses the [JMX Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jmxreceiver) to obtain ActiveMQ metrics, and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. ActiveMQ logs are sent to Sumo Logic through a [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/ActiveMQ-OpenTelemetry/ActiveMQ-OTel-Collection-architecture.png' alt="ActiveMQ OTel Collection architecture" />

This app has been tested with following ActiveMQ versions:
  * 5.17.4
  * 5.18.2

## Log types and metrics

The Sumo Logic App for ActiveMQ assumes:

- ActiveMQ app supports the below log format in the log4j2.properties file.

  * [Audit Logs](https://activemq.apache.org/audit-logging):  Every management action made through JMX or Web Console management interface is logged in audit log files.

    `appender.auditlog.layout.pattern=%d | %-5p | %m | %t%n`

  * ActiveMQ Logs:

    `appender.logfile.layout.pattern=%d | %-5p | %m | %c | %t%n%throwable{full}`


- For a list of metrics that are collected and used by the app, see [ActiveMQ Metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/blob/main/jmx-metrics/docs/target-systems/activemq.md).


## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for ActiveMQ

Following are the [fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of ActiveMQ App install if not already present.

* `messaging.cluster.name`. User configured. Enter a name to uniquely identify your ActiveMQ cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* `messaging.node.name`. Has value of `host name`.
* `messaging.system`. Has fixed value of `activemq`.
* `sumo.datasource`. Has fixed value of `activemq`.

If process metrics are enabled it will also create [fields for JMX metrics](/docs/integrations/app-development/opentelemetry/jmx-opentelemetry#fields-creation-in-sumo-logic-for-jmx).


## Prerequisites

#### Configure logging in ActiveMQ:

  1. By default, ActiveMQ logs (`audit.log` and `activemq.log`) are stored in the directory called `${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/data/activemq.log`. Make a note of this logs directory.

  2. [Enable auditing](https://activemq.apache.org/audit-logging) if not enabled by default.

     `ACTIVEMQ_OPTS="$ACTIVEMQ_OPTS -Dorg.apache.activemq.audit=true"`

  3. Ensure that below log formats are present in [logging configuration](https://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-change-the-logging). Also make sure appropriate log level is set.

      * [Audit Logs](https://activemq.apache.org/audit-logging):

        `appender.auditlog.layout.pattern=%d | %-5p | %m | %t%n`

      * ActiveMQ Logs:

        `appender.logfile.layout.pattern=%d | %-5p | %m | %c | %t%n%throwable{full}`



#### Configure metrics in ActiveMQ:

  1. Follow the instructions in [JMX - OpenTelemetry's prerequisites section](/docs/integrations/app-development/opentelemetry/jmx-opentelemetry#prerequisites) to download the [JMX Metric Gatherer](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-contrib/blob/main/jmx-metrics/README.md) used by the [JMX Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/jmxreceiver#details).


  2. Enable reads metrics from ActiveMQ servers via the [JMX MBeans](https://activemq.apache.org/jmx) by setting `useJmx="true"` in file config [ActiveMQ.xml](https://activemq.apache.org/xml-configuration.html)
       ```xml
       <broker useJmx="true" brokerName="BROKER1">
       ...
       </broker>
       ```

  3. Set the JMX port by changing the `ACTIVEMQ_SUNJMX_START` parameter. Usually it is set in `/opt/activemq/bin/env` or `C:\Program Files\apache-activemq\bin\activemq.bat` file.

      ```
      ACTIVEMQ_SUNJMX_START="$ACTIVEMQ_SUNJMX_START -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=11099 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=${ACTIVEMQ_CONF_DIR}/jmx.password -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=${ACTIVEMQ_CONF_DIR}/jmx.access"
      ```

## Collection configuration and app installation

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md}

### Step 1: Set up OpenTelemetry Collector

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md}

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Kafka-OpenTelemetry/Kafka-Collector.png' alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step we will be configuring the YAML required for ActiveMQ Collection.

Below is the input required:

- **ActiveMQ Server logs file path**. Enter the path to the ActiveMQ log file for your ActiveMQ instance.
- **ActiveMQ Audit logs file path**. Enter the path to the Audit log file for your ActiveMQ instance.
- **JMX Endpoint**. Enter the value in `host:port` form which will be used to construct the Service URL, the Metric Gatherer's JMX client should use.
- **JMX Gatherer file path**. Enter the path to the OpenTelemetry JMX Metric Gatherer file configured in the prerequisites section.
- **Enable password authentication**. Toggle this if you are using password based jmx authentication.
- **UserName**. Username for JMX authentication, if applicable.
- **Password**. Password for JMX authentication, if applicable.
- **Enable ActiveMQ process metrics**. Toggle this to collect ActiveMQ Process metrics. Disable this if you are already collecting process metrics from the host.
- **ActiveMQ process name**. Enter the ActiveMQ process name.It will be used for filtering process metrics based on process name.
- **Fields**. `messaging.cluster.name` User configured. Enter a name to identify this ActiveMQ cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

## Viewing the ActiveMQ dashboards

### Dashboard filters with template variables

Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you can view dynamic changes to the data for a fast resolution to the root cause. For more information, see the [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md) help page.
