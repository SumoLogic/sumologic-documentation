<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware.png')} alt="VMware dashboards" width="50" />

A newer app, [VMware ULM](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware), is available. The App on this page is based on the vMA technology running on legacy vSphere versions 6.0 and prior. The vMA technology is no longer supported by VMware.

The Sumo Logic App for VMware allows you to:

* Collect and centralize logs from the entire VMware infrastructure, including ESX/ESXi, vCenter Server, and individual virtual machines as well as operating system and applications running ESXi, vCenter Server, and individual virtual machines as well as operating system and applications running within the virtual machine.
* Troubleshoot VMware farms and find issues related to over-provisioning VMs, "noisy neighbors", changes to configuration, and VM movement.
* Monitor the entire VMware infrastructure through real-time Dashboards that provide insight into key metrics such as VM CPU, memory and disk utilization. Determine capacity constrained and under-provisioned physical hosts and idle VMs to improve deployment strategy and optimize cost.

### Software Versions

The Sumo Logic App for VMware works with vCenter and vSphere 5.0, 5.1.0.1, 5.0.0.2, 5.5, and 6.0.

* For vCenter and vSpherevMA 5.0 or its dot releases, use vMA 5.0, 5.0.0.1, or 5.0.0.2.
* For vMA version 5.1, use the vMA 5.1 Patch 1, found [here](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;externalId=2044135)
* For vCenter and vSphere 5.5, use vMA 5.5.
* For vCenter and vSphere 6.0, use vMA 6.0.

For vSphere 6.5 and later please use [Sumo Logic App for VMware ULM](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware).

Because vSphere CLI 5.1 has known issues with resxtop and SSL certifications, be sure to use vMA 5.1 Patch 1 (5.1.0.1). (The known issues in 5.1 are documented in the [Release Notes](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/vcli51/vsp5_51_vcli_relnotes.html#knownissues).)


## Log types

The Sumo Logic App for VMware collects logs from vCenter Servers to analyze vCenter Server Events and Performance Data in real time to enable monitoring and detect important events within your virtual environment.

For information on collecting unified logs and metrics for VMware, see [VMware ULM](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware).


## Sample log messages

```json
2017-09-25 22:09:45.123 +0000 2013-11-19T10:03:35.042999Z ,,, message=Task: Delete virtual machine,,,user=SUMO\USER,,,vm=VMNAME,,,host=HOSTNAME.sumolab.org
```

## Sample queries

```sql title="vCenter User Activity"
 _sourceCategory=esx_perf OR _sourceCategory=vcenter_log "message=User "
 | parse "message=User * *,,," as user,task
 | timeslice 5m
 | count as count by _timeslice,task
 | transpose row _timeslice column task as *
```

```sql title="Average Memory Used in MB"
_sourceCategory=esx_perf OR _sourceCategory=vcenter_log "Memory" AND "NonKernel MBytes"
| parse "\\\\*\\Memory\\NonKernel MBytes: *" as esx_server,mbytes
| timeslice by 1h
| avg(mbytes) as mbytes by _timeslice,esx_server
| transpose row _timeslice column esx_server
```


### Sumo Logic Scripts for VMware

The Sumo Logic scripts required to work with the app are located at [sumo-vsphere-ulm.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appdevstore/VMWare/sumo-vsphere-ulm.zip).

For vMA 6.0, use the script package for vSphere 5.5.

Make sure to download the package for your version of vMA and vCenter.


## Collect logs for the VMware (Legacy) App

A newer app, [VMware ULM](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware), is available. The App on this page is based on the vMA technology running on legacy vSphere versions 6.0 and prior. The vMA technology is no longer supported by VMware.

The logs collected from vCenter Servers enable you to use the Sumo Logic Application for VMware search, visualize, and analyze vCenter Server Events and Performance Data in real time to enable monitoring and detect important events within your virtual environment.

### Setting up a vMA Server to Collect Data

Before setting up a source to collect data, you'll need to install vMA through the vCenter Server (if it's not already installed) and then download and install a [Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/collector-installation-reference/download-collector-from-static-url).


### Step 1: Install vMA

vMA is an appliance (SUSE virtual machine) that includes vSphere CLI, and vSphere SDK for Perl. It allows administrators to run scripts or agents that interact with ESXi hosts and vCenter Server systems without having to authenticate each time.

To set up vMA:

1. Download vMA from VMware, and follow the accompanying instructions to deploy the OVF. Go to the vCenter Server through vSphere client, then choose **File > Deploy OVF Template**.

:::note
Because vSphere 5.1 has known issues with resxtop and SSL certifications, be sure to use vMA 5.1 Patch 1 (5.1.0.1). (The known issues in 5.1 are documented in the vMA 5.1 Patch 1 (5.1.0.1). (The known issues in 5.1 are documented in the [Release Notes](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vcli/vcli51/vsp5_51_vcli_relnotes.html#knownissues).
:::

2. Setup the authentication, timezone, and time for the vMA by following instructions in the VMware documentation.
3. Take note to specify a user account in the next step that has adequate permissions on the vCenter servers. This user account will just need the **Global.Service managers** privilege to view only RESXTOP data. Refer this [link](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/06/required-vsphere-privilege-for-read.html) for details.

Run **credstore_admin.pl** on the vMA to add credentials for each vCenter server that generates performance and event data you'd like to collect. This script comes by default with the vSphere Perl SDK. On the vMA it's located under /usr/lib/vmware-vcli/apps/general. (See [this VMware KB article](http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-50/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.perlsdk.pg.doc_50%2Fviperl_credentialstore.8.7.html) for more information). For example, to add a user's account on a vCenter Server you can run:
```bash
/usr/lib/vmware-vcli/apps/general/credstore_admin.pl list
```

In UNIX, when you pass a parameter to a script (credstore_admin.pl in this case), use quotation marks to enclose values containing spaces or special characters like backslash. For example:
```bash
vi-admin@yourservername:/usr/lib/vmware-vcli/apps/general> ./credstore_admin.pl add --server 14.3.2.11
--username "domainname\account name" --password 345345345
```

Run the following command to verify that authentication is set up correctly and to see a list of network interfaces:
```bash
esxcli --server <vcenter host> --vihost <esxi host> network nic list
```

For example, if we run the following, we'll see a list of network interfaces for the ESXi host (192.168.23.24) managed by our vCenter Server (192.168.23.242):
```bash
esxcli --server 192.168.23.242 --vihost 192.168.23.24 network nic
```

For vCenter 6.0, if you receive an error like the following:
```bash
Connect to <your vCenter Server> failed. Server SHA-1 thumbprint: <Your vCenter Thumbprint> (not trusted).
```

5. Run the following command to allow the connection:
```bash
/usr/lib/vmware-vcli/apps/<wbr/>general/credstore_admin.pl add -s <your vCenter Server>  
--thumbprint <Thumbprint Above>
```


### Step 2: Download and Install the Collector on vMA

1. Download the appropriate Collector executable from this topic: [Download a Collector from a Static URL](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/collector-installation-reference/download-collector-from-static-url).
2. On the vMA machine, use **wget** or **curl** to download the file from the URL. The URL must be enclosed in double-quotes to work with **wget**. For example:
```bash
sudo wget "https://collectors.sumologic.com/rest/download/linux/64" \
-O SumoCollector.sh
```

From the download directory, run the installation file **SumoCollector.sh** as root. First, make sure root has executable privileges for the file by running:  
```bash
sudo chmod 740 SumoCollector.sh
```

3. Run the install file on your server with root privileges:  
```bash
$ sudo ./SumoCollector.sh
```
4. The Collector runs as a service and starts automatically after installing or rebooting.


## Collecting Event Messages

An event is an action that triggers an event message on a vCenter Server. Event messages are not logged, but are instead stored in the vCenter Server database. Sumo Logic for VMware retrieves these messages using the vSphere Perl SDK that comes with vMA (by default).


### Step 1: Configure a Syslog Source for the Collector  

A Sumo Logic [Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/syslog-source) operates like a Syslog server listening on the designated port to receive Syslog messages.

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**, and click **Add Source**.
2. Select **Syslog** for the Source type.
3. Enter a **Name** to display for this Source. Source name metadata is stored in a searchable field called _sourceName.
4. For **Protocol** choose **TCP**.
5. Enter the **Port** number for the Source to listen to (for example, 1514, but choose the correct port for your Collector).
6. For **Source Category**, we recommend using **vcenter_log**.
7. Under **Advanced**, set the following options:
    * Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    * Select **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use** and then choose **UTC** from the menu (as shown below).
8. Click **Save**.


### Step 2: Configure Logs to be Collected

1. On the vMA, create a directory to hold all Sumo Logic scripts, found under [Sumo Logic Scripts for VMware](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware-legacy). Name the directory **/var/log/vmware** or something similar.
2. Download the Sumo Logic VMware scripts using the **vSphere5.0.gz** and **vSphere5.5.gz** links on [this](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/vmware-legacy) page, then put them in the directory you just created.
3. We will assume the user account running the Sumo Logic vmware scripts  is the "vi-admin" user. This user account should not be a "root" user and should have full read write execute permissions to the directories where the **vSphere5.0.gz** and **vSphere5.5.gz** files are extracted. In the absence of adequate permissions, unexpected script errors will occur.
4. Edit the **cron_vcenter_events.sh** script by changing the `SCRIPT_PATH` variable to reflect the absolute path where the script resides.

If you have multiple vCenter servers, create a new line for each one. Make sure you add the credential for each server (as described in [Install vMA](#Step_1:_Install_vMA)).
5. Test running the **query_vCenter.pl** script (that queries the vCenter Server for events) as described in [Troubleshooting and Manual Testing](#Troubleshooting_and_Manual_Testing). Use the following example command:
```sql
query_vCenter.pl -s [vcenterserver] -f output.txt
```
6. Create a cron job to periodically run the **cron_vcenter_events.sh** script at the interval you'd like.

You'll need to have the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` env variable in the crontab line. For example, to run the job every two minutes, you'd use something like:
```bash
*/2 * * * * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/opt/vmware/vma/lib64:/opt/vmware/vma/lib /var/log/vmware/cron_vcenter_events.sh
```

## Collect Performance Logs

Collecting performance logs involves using VMware tools and scripts running on vMA to extract performance statistics.

### Step 1: Configure a Local File Source

Configure a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**, and click **Add Source** for your vCenter Server Collector.
2. Select **Local File** for the Source type.
3. Enter a **Name** to display for this Source. Source name metadata is stored in a searchable field called `_sourceName`.
4. For File Path, enter **/var/log/vmware/*.perf.out.**
5. For **Source Category**, enter **esx_perf**.
6. Under **Advanced**, make sure that **Timestamp Parsing** is selected. Then for **Time Zone** choose the time zone of the vMA virtual machine.
7. Click **Save**.


### Step 2: Configure Performance Logs for Collection

Before collecting can begin, you'll need to invoke scripts to transform the performance data from the **resxtop** utility so it's delivered in a format that Sumo Logic can consume.

1. On the vMA, create a directory to hold all scripts (for example, **/var/log/vmware**).
2. Extract all files from the Zip bundle provided by Sumo Logic to the directory you just created. Edit the **vcenter.info** file so one vCenter Server and one username is on each line.
For example: 
```bash
vcenter01.company.com "domain_name\user_name"
```

```bash
vcenter02.company.com "domain_name\user_name"
```

```bash
vcenter03.company.com "domain_name\user_name"
```

3. Make sure there are no blank lines or header lines in the **vcenter.info** file.
4. Run **/usr/lib/vmware-vcli/apps/general/credstore_admin.pl list** to get a list of all the vCenter Servers you have already configured for authentication. 
5. Edit the following in the **cron_vcenter_perf.sh** script:
    * Change the **SCRIPT_PATH** variable to reflect the absolute path where the script resides.
    * Select the method you'd like to use to collect performance data. Then, uncomment the line that calls **$SCRIPT_PATH/getserver_perf.pl**. For more information, see Segmenting Collection.

Test the command used in the cron script before testing the cron command and enabling it as described in [Troubleshooting and Manual Testing](#Troubleshooting_and_Manual_Testing).
```bash
$SCRIPT_PATH/getserver_perf.pl -type=vcenter -path=$SCRIPT_PATH -server_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter.info
```

```bash
-output_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter_all.perf.out
```

Run the **cron_vcenter_perf.sh** script. After it finishes, verify that performance logs are being collected. You should see the **esxi.perf.out** file in the above `$SCRIPT_PATH` directory; the file should have at least 7000-8000 messages per ESXi server that is managed by a vCenter.

The script collects all the default performance data returned by the resxtop utility. If however, you need to collect only certain performance related data, then invoke resxtop on the VMA machine in interactive mode, select only the panels and columns that you want to collect, and then save the configuration in the **/home/vi-admin/.** file. The script package also contains a configuration file (**esxtop50rc**) for the metrics used by the app. To use it, you add `-c` to the four entries in the **getserver_perf5.5.pl** file where you will see **/usr/bin/resxtop**. You will need to insert `-c esxtop50rc` after `/` **usr** **/bin/resxtop**. For information on invoking resxtop in interactive mode, refer to [VMware documentation](https://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-4-esx-vcenter/index.jsp?topic=/com.vmware.vsphere.resourcemanagement.doc_41/performance_monitoring_utilities_resxtop_and_esxtop/c_use_esxtop_or_resxtop_in_interactive_mode.html).  

For example, in line 138, change:
```bash
echo \'$pwd\' | /usr/bin/resxtop --server $host --username $user -b -n $iterations > $local_csv_file `;`
```

to
```bash
echo \'$pwd\' | /usr/bin/resxtop --server $host -c esxtop50rc --username $user -b -n $iterations > $local_csv_file;
```

Another way to reduce the amount of data is to reduce the frequency of running `cron_vcenter_perf.sh` (see below).

If you see output that looks like the example below, this is a password echo, and not a password prompt. It is a sign that the script is working.

```
vi-admin@<vma-hostname>>~
/opt/SumoScripts/cron_vcenter_perf.sh
vi-admin's password:
domain_name\user_name password:
```

```
*/15 * * * * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/opt/vmware/vma/lib64:/opt/vmware/vma/lib /var/log/vmware/cron_vcenter_perf.sh
```

7. Create a cron job to periodically run the **cron_vcenter_perf.sh** script. For example, to run the script every 15 minutes, it would look like:

## Understand vCenter Scripts

In this section, we'll walk you through a few important tasks that involve the `query_vCenter.pl` script, or `query_vCenter5.5.pl`, depending on the exact version you are using. These scripts query the vCenter Server for events.


### Troubleshooting and Manual Testing

Test the **query_vCenter.pl** script before setting up a CRON job.

To test the **query_vCenter.pl** script, go to the folder that holds all the scripts (for example, **/var/log/vmware**) and run:
```bash
query_vCenter.pl -s [vcenterserver] -f output.txt
#Replace [vCenterServer] with the name of the \
#target vCenter Server in your environment.
```

In the standard output, you should see the query time range and the number of events collected. The events themselves are stored inside the **output.txt** file. If you're prompted to enter a username or password, it means that the credentials for the target vCenter Server are not set properly. By default, the first time **query_vCenter** is called, events from the past 24 hours are collected. If you want to collect events older than the past 24 hours, see [Collect Historical Events](#Collecting_Historical_Events).

Because the above information is logged into /var/log/message for cron jobs, it's a good idea to monitor /var/log/messages to make sure the collection CRON jobs work well.


### Collect Historical Events

By default, the first time **query_vCenter.pl** is called, events from the past 24 hours are collected. Each time the script is called, it writes the timestamp of the last read event in a file named **.timelog** for the next call to pick up.

If you want to collect events older than the past 24 hours, before setting up the CRON job for **cron_vcenter_events.sh**, do the following on the VMA machine.

To collect historical events:
1. Go to the vi-admin home directory, at **/home/vi-admin**.

Set the `SCRIPT_PATH` environment variable to point to where all the Sumo Logic for VMware scripts reside. For example:  
```bash
vi-admin@vma1:~> export SCRIPT_PATH=/var/log/vmware
```

2. Run the **query_vCenter.pl** script as follows:
```bash
./query_vCenter.pl --server <vcenter server> --target <syslog host>:<syslog port> --bT <time in UTC>
```
3. The syslog server should reflect the IP address or hostname of the vMA machine; the `syslog_port` should reflect the port number that you previously set up for the Source responsible for collecting vCenter Server Events. For example, to collect all events starting from 5:00pm on October 8, 2012 in the UTC timezone, you would run the following command:
```bash
./query_vCenter.pl --server 192.168.23.242 --target vmahost:1514 --bT 2012-10-08T00:17:00.00Z
```

Once this command completes successfully, you can begin to pick up ongoing events by setting up the CRON job as described in step 2 of [Collecting Event Messages](#Collecting_Event_Messages).


## Segmenting Performance Collection

Performance data collection for ESXi servers associated with a vCenter server works by sequentially getting data from each ESXi server. Having a large number of servers associated with a vCenter can cause delays. To avoid delays, you can **parallelize** collection by creating multiple **segments** from the list of ESXi servers associated with a vCenter server. The number of segments would depend on the amount of data you are collecting and how often you would like to collect performance data.

For example, let's say you have a 100 ESXi servers associated with a single vCenter server; it takes more than 2 minutes for the performance collection script to collect data from all ESXi servers. If you need to collect performance data snapshots every 2 minutes, you'd segment the collection into two or more instances of the **cron_vcenter_perf.sh** script to parallelize collection.

Or, if you have 100ESXi servers and five segments, then each segment would have 20 servers. However, if there's an odd number of servers, say 145 servers and 6 segments, then 5 segments have 24 servers, and the last (6th) segment will have 20 servers.

The total number of segments is specified by the `-segments` option, and the segment number we want to run is specified by the `segment_number `option.

Before collecting from multiple segments, you can test how ESXi servers will be divided up into segments by using the` -test` option. For example, to test which servers get assigned to each segment assuming you have two segments, you would run the following command:
```bash
$SCRIPT_PATH/getserver_perf.pl -test -type=vcenter -path=$SCRIPT_PATH -server_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter.info
-output_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter_segments.perf.out -segments=2 -segment_number=1 | /bin/logger
```

Then to get performance data just for segment one, you can run this command:
```bash
$SCRIPT_PATH/getserver_perf.pl -type=vcenter -path=$SCRIPT_PATH -server_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter.info
-output_file=$SCRIPT_PATH/vcenter_segment-3.perf.out -segments=2 -segment_number=1 | /bin/logger
```

and so on.

Once you are satisfied with the time it takes for collecting data for a segment, create multiple scripts to collect data for each segment based on the **cron_vcenter_perf.sh** script. Schedule these scripts to run as a cron job according to the desired frequency.
