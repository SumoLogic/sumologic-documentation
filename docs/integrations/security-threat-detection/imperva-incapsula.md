## Collecting Logs for the Imperva-Incapsula WAF App

This section provides instructions on configuring log collection for the Imperva - Incapsula Web Application Firewall App, as well as query samples.

### Set up log integration in Imperva Incapsula

To configure log integration, do the following:

1. Log into your [my.incapsula.com](https://my.incapsula.com/admin/login) account.
2. On the sidebar, click **Logs > Log Setup**.
3. **Connection**. Select **Amazon S3**.
4. Next, fill in your credentials:
    * Your S3 **Access key, Secret key, and Path**, where path is the location of the folder where you want to store the logs. Enter the path in the following format: `<Amazon S3 bucket name>/<log folder>`. For example: MyBucket/MyIncapsulaLogFolder.
    * Click **Test connection** to perform a full testing cycle in which a test file will be transferred to your designated folder. The test file does not contain real data, and will be removed by Incapsula when the transfer is complete.
5. Configure the additional options:
    * **Format**. Select the format for the log files: **CEF**
    * **Compress logs**. By default, log files are compressed. Clear this option to keep the logs uncompressed.

For detailed instructions, see [here](https://docs.incapsula.com/Content/management-console-and-settings/log-integration.htm?Highlight=siem#Enable).
