The CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection app provides visibility into the security posture of your endpoints as analyzed by the CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection platform. The app allows you to analyze indicators of compromise (IOCs) by affected users, tactic, technique, and objective, and identify hosts on your network with the highest malware detections. The dashboards in this app help identify threats and incidents, from which you can drill down to investigate further.

The [CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection Platform](https://www.crowdstrike.com/endpoint-security-products/falcon-platform/) is a cloud-native framework that protects endpoints to stop breaches and improve performance with the robust power of the cloud combined with an intelligent, lightweight endpoint agent.

This version of the CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection app and its collection process has been tested with SIEM Connector Version 2.1.0+001-siem-release-2.1.0.

## Log types

The CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection app uses the following log types:
* Detection Event
* Authentication Event
* Detection Status Update Event

For more information on Events, please refer to the CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection [Streaming API Event Dictionary](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/62/streaming-api-event-dictionary).

## Collecting Logs for the CrowdStrike app

This section shows you how to configure log collection from CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection and have them sent to Sumo Logic. CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection provides endpoint detection and response, next-gen antivirus, and threat intelligence services through the cloud. Multiple security functions are consolidated into a single lightweight agent, for visibility across using central security analytics with Sumo Logic.

:::warning
To collect logs from CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection, if you are not using the Sumo Logic FedRamp deployment, use the [new Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for Crowdstrike](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/crowdstrike-source) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

The sections below are deprecated for non-FedRamp Sumo Logic deployments. If you're using the Sumo Logic FedRamp deployment, use the sections below to configure the collection for this app.
:::


### Collection process overview (DEPRECATED)  

SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management) are used to gather data from a variety of security products to detect, investigate, correlate, and remediate security threats. The [Falcon SIEM Connector](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/data-sheets/falcon-connector/) provides a fast and efficient way to optimize collection across an extensive number of endpoints.

:::note
Sumo Logic recommends installing the SIEM Connector and Sumo Logic Collector on the same machine for best performance.
:::

To set up log collection for CrowdStrike Falcon, you'll download, install, and configure the CrowdStrike SIEM Connector to send data to Sumo Logic, through performing the following tasks.


#### Data collection flow (DEPRECATED)

The following graphic illustrates the Sumo Logic collection of CrowdStrike streaming API events using a SIEM Connector.


### Before you begin (DEPRECATED)

It is important that you complete the following tasks before you start to configure log collection for CrowdStrike Falcon:

* Download the SIEM Connector guide, familiarize yourself with [SIEM Connector](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/14/siem-connector) and its config settings.
* [Contact CrowdStrike support](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/) to enable the streaming APIs in your environment. You must do this before using the SIEM connector.


### Step 1. Download and install CrowdStrike SIEM Connector on a host machine (DEPRECATED)

You perform this procedure from the Falcon console. You must have permission to be able to download and install from Falcon to complete this task.

To install a CrowdStrike SIEM Connector on a host machine, do the following:
1. Login to your Falcon console and go to [Support > Tool Downloads](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/tool-downloads).
2. Download the **SIEM Connector** installer for your operating system.
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Run the following installation command appropriate for your OS, replacing the `<installer package>` variable with the SIEM installer you downloaded:
* **CentOS**: `sudo rpm -Uvh <installer package>`
* **Ubuntu**: `sudo dpkg -i <installer package>`


### Step 2. Configure CrowdStrike SIEM Connector (DEPRECATED)

This SIEM connector will stream events data from CrowdStrike Falcon Cloud in JSON format into a local file (output). The default location of the **output** file is `/var/log/crowdstrike/falconhoseclient/output`.

To configure CrowdStrike SIEM Connector, do the following:

1. In the Falcon console go to [Support > API Clients & Keys](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/api-clients-and-keys).
2. [Create an API client](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/1/crowdstrike-api-introduction#auth_apiclient) to use with the SIEM connector, and record its API client ID and API client secret. In the the **Edit API client** dialog, ONLY select the **Event streams** option, and then click **Save**.
   1. Open the **/opt/crowdstrike/etc/cs.falconhoseclient.cfg** file in a text editor.
   2. Edit the following lines in the **cs.falconhoseclient.cfg** file:
   * Change **app_id** to **SIEM-Connector.**
   * **client_id** - Add your recorded API Client ID
   * **client_secret** - Add your recorded API Client Secret
   * Make sure **output_format** is set to **json**
   * For **EventTypeCollection** section - Enable all events:
     * DetectionSummaryEvent = true
     * AuthActivityAuditEvent = true
     * UserActivityAuditEvent = true
     * HashSpreadingEvent = true
     * RemoteResponseSessionStartEvent = true
     * RemoteResponseSessionEndEvent = true
   3. Save your changes.
   4. Restart the SIEM Connector, as appropriate for your OS:
     * **CentOS:** `sudo service cs.falconhoseclientd start`
     * **Ubuntu 14.x:** `sudo start cs.falconhoseclientd`
     * **Ubuntu 16.4:** `sudo systemctl start cs.falconhoseclientd.service`


### Step 3. Set up a Sumo Logic installed collector and local file source (DEPRECATED)

You setup a Sumo Logic installed collector on the same host as the SIEM Connector. Then, set up a local file source on the installed collector to read the output file from [Step 2](#Step_2._Configure_CrowdStrike_SIEM_Connector) and send CrowdStrike Falcon Events to Sumo Logic.

To set up an installed collector and local file source, do the following:

1. Install a Sumo Logic collector on the same host as the SIEM Connector. Follow the instructions for your operating system as described in [Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
2. Add a local file source to the collector for Streaming API Events. Follow the steps on [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source), with these additional changes:
* Set the **Filepath** to: `/var/log/crowdstrike/falconhoseclient/output`
* Set the **Source Category** to: `crowdstrike/falcon`
* Under **Enable Multiline Processing**, check  **Boundary Regex**  and enter the following regex: `^\{.*`.
3. Click **Save**.
