The Trend Micro Deep Security app works with system and security events to monitor event history such as anti-malware, IPS, web reputation, firewall, integrity and log inspection events. The app analyzes security events from both on-premises and cloud-based Trend Micro Deep Security products.


## Log types

There are two types of Deep Security events:

* System Events
* Security Events

For complete details on configuring your Deep Security system for use with Sumo Logic, see the White Paper, [“Deep Security Integration with Sumo Logic”](http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Deep-Security-Sumo-Logic-Integration-Guide-FV1.62.pdf).


## Collect on-premises logs for the Trend Micro Deep Security app

This section provides instructions for configuring on-prem log collection for the Trend Micro Deep Security app, as well as examples of relevant log and query samples.


### Configure Collector and Sources

To collect logs for Deep Security, do the following:

1. Configure a [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
2. Configure a [Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/syslog-source).

When you configure the Syslog Sources, for Protocol, select UDP.


### Configure Deep Security System Event Log Forwarding

For complete details on configuring your Deep Security system for use with Sumo Logic, see the White Paper, “[Deep Security Integration with Sumo Logic](http://www.trendmicro.com/aws/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Deep-Security-Sumo-Logic-Integration-Guide-FV1.62.pdf)”.


To forward Deep Security system events to Sumo Logic, do the following:

1. In Deep Security, go to **Administration > System Settings > SIEM**.
2. Configure **SIEM**:
    1. **Forward System Events to a remote computer (via Syslog).** Activate this check box.
    2. **Hostname or IP address to which events should be sent.** This is the hostname or IP address of the Sumo Logic Installed Collector.
    3. **UDP port to which events should be sent.** Enter 514.
    4. **Syslog Facility.** Select Local 0.
    5. **Syslog Format.** Select Common Event Format.
3. Save your changes.


### Configure the Policy

Now you must add the Syslog Source to your Policy configuration. Set the integration details at the Top (root/base) policy as follows:

1. Go to **Settings > SIEM**.
2. For **Anti-Malware Event Forwarding**, select **Forward Events To:** and **Relay via the Manager**.
    1. **Hostname or IP address to which events should be sent.** This is the hostname or IP address of the Sumo Logic Installed Collector.
    1. **UPD port to which events should be sent.**  Enter **514**.
    1. **Syslog Facility.** Select **Local 1**.
    1. **Syslog Format.** Select **Common Event Format**.
3. For **Web Reputation Event Forwarding**, select **Forward Events To:** and **Relay via the Manager**.
    1. **Hostname or IP address to which events should be sent.** This is the hostname or IP address of the Sumo Logic Installed Collector.
    1. **UPD port to which events should be sent.**  Enter **514**.
    1. **Syslog Facility.** Select **Local 1**.
    1. **Syslog Format.** Select **Common Event Format**.
4. Click **Save**.


## Sample log messages

```



### Collect cloud-based logs for the Trend Micro Deep Security app

This section has instructions for collecting logs for the Trend Micro Deep Security using a Sumo Cloud Syslog source on a hosted collector.


#### Step 1: Create a Cloud Syslog source on a hosted collector

1. Select an existing [hosted collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors), or create a new one.
2. Add a [Cloud Syslog source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source) to the hosted collector.
    1. Give the source a name
    2. Enter a Source Category.
    3. Deselect the **Enable Timestamp Parsing**.
    4. Click **Save**.
3. The Cloud Syslog Source Token will be generated. You'll supply this information as input to the Log Source Identifier, Server Name, and Server Port within Deep Security.

Supply this information as input to the Log Source Identifier: Server Name, and Server Port within Deep Security.

For Log Source Identifier field, use this format: `Deep Security Manager [token from Cloud Syslog source]`. Note the spaces with `Deep Security Manager`.

#### Step 2: Configure Sumo as a syslog server in Trend Micro Deep Security.

1. In the Deep Security Manager console, select **Policies > Common Objects.**
2. Expand the **Other** node in the left pane.
3. Select **Syslog Configurations**.
4. Select the **New** button to create a new configuration.
    1. **Log Source Identifier**. Enter a three word label, for example “Deep Security Manager” or “My Log Source”, followed by value that was shown in the **Token** field on the **Cloud Syslog Source Token** page (when you configured the Cloud Syslog Source above), surrounded by square brackets like this: `Deep Security Manager [token from Cloud Syslog source]`. It's important that you use this format. `Deep Security Manager` followed by the `token` (for the Cloud Syslog Source) in square brackets like this:
     ```
     Deep Security Manager [token from Cloud Syslog source]
     ```
5. **Server Name**. Enter the value that was shown in the **Host** field on the **Cloud Syslog Source Token** page when you configured the Cloud Syslog Source above.
6. **Server Port**.  Enter the value that was shown in the **Port** field on the **Cloud Syslog Source Token** page when you configured the Cloud Syslog Source above.
7. **Transport**. Leave "TLS" selected. To check your connection for TLS, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source#troubleshooting) in our Cloud Syslog Source article.
8. Click **OK**.


#### Step 3: Forward system and security events to Sumo Logic

1. In the Deep Security Manager console, select **Policies**.
2. Double-click the policy you want to use for forwarding events.
3. Go to **Settings > Event Forwarding**.
4. Under **Event Forwarding Frequency (from the Agent/Appliance)**, specify how often events are to be sent to Sumo Logic.
5. Under **Event Forwarding Configuration (from the Agent/Appliance)**, specify the syslog configuration to use for each protection module, choosing from the following options:
   * **Inherited (configuration name):** The behavior is inherited from a parent policy or computer.
   * **None:** Events are not forwarded.
   * **_Syslog (configuration name):** Events are forwarded to the specified syslog configuration. To see details about the configuration or edit it, click **Edit**. The configuration must have **Agents should forward logs** set to "Via the Deep Security Manager".
   * **New:** Enables you to define a new configuration (for details, see [Define a syslog configuration](https://help.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/siem-syslog-forwarding-secure.html#Define).) The configuration must have **Agents should forward logs** set to "Via the Deep Security Manager".
6. Click **Save**.


#### Verify configuration

Send System Events to confirm communication with Sumo Logic. There may be a 5-10 minute delay.
