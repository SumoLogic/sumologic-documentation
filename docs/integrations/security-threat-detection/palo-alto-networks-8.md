## Installing the Palo Alto Networks 8 App

This section provides instructions for installing the Palo Alto Networks 8 App, along with examples of each of the dashboards that provide visual insights into your data.

This app supports PAN-OS v7 and v8.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Palo Alto Networks 8 Dashboards

### Overview

**Description:** See an overview of system, correlation, configuration, and trap events; threats; and bandwidth consumption by app and by virtual system.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard for an overview of various activities by severity level, geo-location, and bandwidth consumption. Based on the results you see, you can go to more detailed dashboards to drill down for details. For example, if the “Threats By Severity Level” panel shows that there are “Critical” threats, you can proceed to the threat-related dashboards, including Threat Overview, Threat Analysis, Traffic Insight - File Activity, and Traffic Insight - Web Activity.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Overview.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### Configuration Analysis

**Description:** See information about changes to your firewall configurations, including a breakdown of submitted, succeeded, and failed configuration updates; the trend of configuration update statuses; the top 10 IPs used for configuration changes; the top 10 admin users; and the top 10 commands executed.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to learn about firewall configuration changes. You can identify who performed a configuration change, and the system from which the configuration change was made. The dashboard also helps you identify failed and successful configurations changes. If you observe a sudden change in device behavior, you can check this dashboard to investigate whether a configuration change might be to blame.  

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Configuration-Analysis.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### Correlation Analysis

**Description:** See information about correlated events, including breakdowns of correlated events by severity, category, source user, and object; events by source IP; and recent correlation feeds.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to identify hosts that are compromised, very likely compromised, likely compromised, or possibly compromised, based on correlation events.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Correlation-Analysis.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### High Severity Threats

**Description:** See information about the top 10 source IPs by bytes; high and critical severity threats by destination ID, and by Source ID; threat distribution by severity; bandwidth consumption by app; and outlier analysis of allowed and rejected requests.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to identify the impact of high severity threats, including the most involved  source and destination IPs. You can identify threats affecting multiple IPs, IPs affected by multiple threats, and identify source IPs or users which are responsible for generating high severity threats or are impacted by high severity threats.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-High-Severity-Threats.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### System Monitoring

**Description:** See breakdowns of events by subtype, module, severity, and EventID; objects by severity level and event type; and recent logs to the system feed.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to identify system issues like hardware failures, HA failures, link down status, dropped connections with external devices, firmware / software upgrades, password change notifications, log in/log off, administrator name or password change, any configuration change, and other minor events.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-System-Monitoring.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### Threat Overview

**Description:** See breakdowns of each threat type by severity; threat analytics, including threat outliers and a time comparison of current threats versus threats in the previous hour, day, and previous week; threats affecting the most destination IPs; IPs generating multiple threats; and IPs observing multiple threats.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to identify threat subtypes. Based on what you learn, you can drill down for additional detail in the “Threat Analysis” dashboard. You can also use this dashboard to identify threats that affect multiple IPs, IPs affected by multiple threats, and narrow in on source IPs or users that are responsible for generating threats or are impacted by threats.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Threat-Overview.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### Threat Analysis

**Description:** See analytics and details about threats, including the count of threats whose severity is greater that “Informational”; breakdowns of threats by subtype and severity; and recent critical and non-critical threat feeds.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to get detailed information on threats identified, rules fired, actions, trends, threat outliers, and threat directions.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Threat-Analysis.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />


### Traffic Monitoring

**Description:** See information about firewall traffic, including protocol usage; top source IPs, apps, destination IPs, source users, and destination ports; and outlier analysis of rejected and accepted traffic.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to detect sudden changes in allowed or rejected traffic in the outlier panels. To investigate outliers, look for a corresponding change in rules configuration on the Configuration Analysis dashboard.

You can also monitor the types of content being accessed by various apps and virtual systems. You can track the bandwidth consumed by specific apps and take corrective action as necessary. Using the geolocation map, you can track source and destination locations and determine whether a location is expected, and block it, as appropriate.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-8-Traffic-Monitoring.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_8 Dashboard" />

### Traffic Insight - File Activity

**Description:** See information about firewall requests that involved file uploads or downloads, including upload/download event counts; top file types, file names, and apps; and time comparison and outlier analysis of download and upload traffic.

**Use case:** Use this dashboard to monitor end users’ file upload and download activities. You can track suspicious file types being uploaded or downloaded through various apps. It also provides insight into sudden changes in activities though outliers. You can compare the current activity trend with the the previous hour, the same time yesterday, and the same time last week with the time compare panel.
