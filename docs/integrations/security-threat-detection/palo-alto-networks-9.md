## Collecting Logs for the Palo Alto Networks 9 App

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic App for Palo Alto Networks 9. You must have Palo Alto Networks Web administrative user permissions to successfully complete these tasks. Configuring log collection for Palo Alto Networks 9 includes the following tasks:

### Step 1. Create a hosted collector and Cloud Syslog source

In this step you configure a hosted collector with a Cloud Syslog source that will act as Syslog server to receive logs and events from Palo Alto Networks devices.

To configure a hosted collector with a Cloud Syslog source, do the following:

1. Log in to Sumo Logic and create a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Create a [Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source) on the hosted collector, specifying the following:
    1. Enter a Source Name.
    2. Provide a Source Category: **NW/PAN/V9**
3. Click **Save**.
4. Copy the Token, host URL and TCP TLS Port to a safe place. You will need this information in the tasks that follow.


### Step 2. Define the destination for the logs

In this step you create a server profile where you can define the log destination. This will be the host name, port and protocol (TLS) of the Sumo Logic Cloud Syslog source.

To create a server profile specifying  the log destination, do the following:

1. Login to the Palo Alto Networks Web interface as an administrative user.
2. Select **Device tab > Server Profiles > Syslog**.
3. Click **Add** at the bottom of the screen and provide endpoint details and a profile name, such as Sumo_Logs_Profile01.
4. In the **Syslog Server Profile** window, select the **Servers** tab and click **Add**.
5. In the **Servers** window, specify the following information:
   * **Name**: `Sumo_CloudSyslog_EndPoint01`
   * **Syslog Server**: URL from [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source)
   * **Transport**: SSL
   * **Port**: Port from [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source)
    * **Format**: `IETF`
    * **Facility**: `LOG_USER`
6. In the **Syslog Server Profile** window, select the **Custom Log Format** tab, and use the following custom format for the following log types. In each code snippet, you'll need your token from [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-hosted-collector-and-cloud-syslog-source).
    * [Config](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/config-log-fields.html).

     ```
7. Click **OK**.
8. Commit the changes.


### Step 3. Configure syslog forwarding

To configure syslog forwarding for each log type (`config`, `system`, `threat`, `traffic`, `HIPMatch`, `USERID`), follow the steps to [Configure Log Forwarding](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding) as described in the Palo Networks documentation.


### Step 4. Verify logs in Palo Alto Networks

In this step, you view logs using the Palo Alto Network Web interface to confirm the logs are generated on the firewall.

To verify the logs in Palo Alto Networks, do the following:
1. In the Palo Alto Networks UI, select **Monitor** > **Logs**.
2. Once the setup is done, log in to Sumo Logic.
3. To validate that the logs are flowing to Sumo Logic, run a query using the source category you configured during [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source), such as: `_sourceCategory = NW/PAN/V9`.

### HIPMatch Monitoring

The Palo Alto Networks 9 - HIPMatch Monitoring dashboard provides visibility into the number of HIP events, HIP name, HIP type, and firewall devices accessing your network. Panels also show information on active hosts and users, as well as users and systems with multiple policy violations.

The [GlobalProtect Host Information Profile (HIP) matching](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/8-0/globalprotect-admin/host-information/configure-hip-based-policy-enforcement.html) collects information on the security status of the end devices accessing your network. A firewall can allow or deny access to a host based on HIP-based security rules. HIP Match logs display traffic flows that match a [HIP Object](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/8-0/globalprotect-admin/host-information/about-host-information/how-does-the-gateway-use-the-host-information-to-enforce-policy.html) or [HIP Profile](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/globalprotect/8-0/globalprotect-admin/host-information/about-host-information/how-does-the-gateway-use-the-host-information-to-enforce-policy.html) configured for rules.


<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Palo-Alto-Networks-9-HIPMatch-Monitoring.png')} alt="Palo_Alto_Networks_9 Dashboard" />
