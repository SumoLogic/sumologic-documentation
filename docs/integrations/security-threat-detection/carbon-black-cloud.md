The Carbon Black Cloud app analyzes alert and event data from Endpoint Standard and Enterprise EDR products and provides comprehensive visibility into the security posture of your endpoints, enabling you to determine the effects of breaches in your environment. The app provides visibility into key endpoint security data with pre-configured dashboards for alerts, threats intelligence, feeds, sensors, alerts, users, hosts, processes, IOCs, devices and network status.

## Log types

The Carbon Black Cloud app uses the following Carbon Black Cloud log types:
* Alert Data
* Event Data

### Sample log messages

For sample log messages, see [Data Samples](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/platform/latest/data-forwarder-data/#data-samples) section in VMware help.
