The F5 - BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) app helps you optimize and secure network traffic patterns coming into your data center using the F5 BIG-IP platform.

The Sumo Logic app for F5 - BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) helps you optimize and secure network traffic patterns coming into your data center using the F5 BIG-IP platform. This app analyzes traffic flowing through the F5 Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and automatically detects threats using Sumo Logic Threat Intel. The Sumo Logic app for F5 - BIG-IP LTM provides pre-configured dashboards that allow you to monitor traffic details by application, facility, pool, active and non-responding hosts, connections, and logins. It also reports LTM CPU, disk usage, and outliers in LTM activities and traffic patterns.

## Log types

The F5 - BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) app uses event logs with payloads, as described in this [document.](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/output-example.html#ltm-request-log)

### Sample log message 

```json title="LTM Request Log"
{
    "event_source":"request_logging",
    "event_timestamp":"2019-01-01:01:01.000Z",
    "hostname":"hostname",
    "client_ip":"192.0.2.42",
    "server_ip":"",
    "http_method":"GET",
    "http_uri":"/",
    "virtual_name":"/Common/app.app/app_vs",
    "tenant":"Common",
    "application":"app.app",
    "telemetryEventCategory": "LTM"
}
```

### Sample query

The following query sample is from the **F5 - BIG-IP LTM - Overview** Dashboard, **Pool Status** panel.

```
_sourceCategory=f5/bigip/ltm  systemInfo

## Collecting logs for the F5 - BIG-IP LTM app

This section provides instructions for collecting logs for the F5 - BIG-IP LTM App, as well as a sample log message and query sample.

### Collection overview

The following image provides a high-level view of the F5 - BIG-IP LTM collection process using the [Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Telemetry-Services.png')} alt="Telemetry-Services" />

Telemetry Streaming (TS) is a software RPM file. Installing it on BIG-IP enables you to declaratively aggregate, normalize, and forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to a consumer application by posting a single TS JSON declaration to TS’s declarative REST API endpoint.

Telemetry Streaming uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. For more information on Telemetry Streaming, see [here](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/).

### Configure log collection for the F5 - BIG-IP LTM app

#### Prerequisite

1. Install [AS3 RPM](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/userguide/installation.html). The [Application Services 3 (AS3)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) extension is a mechanism for declaratively configuring application-specific resources on a BIG-IP system. This involves posting a JSON declaration to the system’s API endpoint, `https://< BIG-IP>/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare`.
2. Install Telemetry Streaming RPM (download from [here](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-telemetry-streaming/releases)).
  * Login to F5 (user admin, password from the above output), navigate to the Main tab, **iApps > Package Management LX > Import**.
  * Select the downloaded file and click **Upload** to upload Telemetry Streaming RPM. For more information on installing TS RPM, see [here](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/installation.html).
3. Enable AVR. To enable the AVR, follow the steps below:
   * Go to **System > Resource Provisioning.**
   * Enable Application Visibility and Reporting (AVR)
   * Click **Submit.**

### Collection Setup

Perform the following tasks to configure log collection for the F5 - BIG-IP LTM App.

#### Step 1: Create a Sumo Logic Hosted Collector

1. Configure a Hosted Collector in Sumo Logic using [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Add an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics), configuring the Source Category with the string f5 in it (e.g., “f5/ltm”). Make a note of the URL for the HTTP source, as you will need it in the following steps. The URL for our example is: `https://collectors.us2.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/Thisis4fakeendpoint4testing==`.

#### Step 2: Use AS3 Declarative language to define a logging profile on BIG-IP.

Download [AS3Listener.json from here](https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/F5LTM/AS3Listener.json), and we will use it to define the logging profile st BIG IP.

Use the following curl cmd to set logging profile at BIG-IP. Replace `BIG-IP PWD`, `BIG-IP IP`, and `PORT` in the following cmd:

```bash
curl -k --user admin:<BIG-IP PWD> -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d@AS3Listener.json https://<BIG-IP IP>:<PORT>/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declare | python -m json.tool
```

#### Step 3: Sumo Logic Consumer Set up using Telemetry  

Download [Sumo Logic Consumer sumo.json from here](https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/F5LTM/sumo.json), and replace `SUMOLOGIC_HOST`.

`SUMOLOGIC_SECRET_KEY` and `SUMOLOGIC_PATH` with values from Sumo logic HTTP URL created in step 1.

Example: For the Sumo Logic HTTP URL `https://collectors.us2.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/Thisis4fakeendpoint4testing==`, the above values are as follows:
* `SUMOLOGIC_HOST`. `collectors.us2.sumologic.com`
* `SUMOLOGIC_SECRET_KEY`. `/receiver/v1/http/`
* `SUMOLOGIC_PATH`. `Thisis4fakeendpoint4testing==`

Now, using telemetry, we will define a [Sumo Logic sink](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest/setting-up-consumer.html#sumo-logic). This will enable us to forward statistics and events from the BIG-IP to Sumo Logic. Use the following curl cmd and replace `BIG-IP PWD`, `BIG-IP IP`, and `PORT`.

```bash
curl -k --user admin:<BIGIP PWD> -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST -d@sumo.json https://<BIG-IP IP>:<PORT>3/mgmt/shared/telemetry/declare | python -m json.tool
```
