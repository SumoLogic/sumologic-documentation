:::info legacy
This document contains our legacy collection method for non-Fedramp Sumo logic deployments. If you are not using the Sumo Logic FedRamp deployment, use the [new Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for Netskope](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/netskope-source) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.
:::

The Netskope App provides visibility into the security posture of your applications and helps you determine the overall usage of software and SaaS applications.

Netskope is a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) hosted in the cloud. The Netskope product is primarily used for enforcing security policies for cloud-based resources, such as Box and Microsoft Office 365. Customers purchase a CASB to address cloud service risks, enforce security policies, and comply with regulations, even when cloud services are beyond their perimeter and out of their direct control.

## Log types

The Netskope App provides a collector source for pulling all the events and alerts from Netskope in real-time via API calls and ingests them into the Sumo Logic platform through our Hosted collector.

For more information on Netskope, refer to the Netskope [documentation](https://www.netskope.com/platform/how-it-works).

## Collect Logs for Netskope

The sections below are deprecated for non-FedRamp Sumo Logic deployments. If you're using the Sumo Logic FedRamp deployment, use the sections below to configure the collection for this app.


### Collection Overview (DEPRECATED)

Sumo Logic provides a collector agent that pulls logs from Netskope with API calls. You can configure the list of events and alerts to be collected, but by default all events and alerts are collected.

The events and alerts are forwarded to the Sumo Logic HTTP endpoint in JSON format. The configuration from a yaml file, which is stored in the home directory, is used. By default the collection starts from last 7 days, but this setting is configurable.

The Netskope App has the following components:

* **Application Usage:** Insights into application usage; specifically by devices, users, users and traffic patterns.
* **Security Alerts:** Visibility into Netskope security alerts and violations and the ability to identify effects of a breach.  


### Step 1: Adding a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source (DEPRECATED)

This section demonstrates how to add a hosted Sumo Logic collector and HTTP Logs and Metrics source, to collect events for Netskope


#### Prerequisites

Before creating the HTTP source, identify the Sumo Logic Hosted Collector you want to use, or create a new Hosted Collector as described in the following task.

When you configure the HTTP Source, make sure to save the HTTP Source Address URL. You will need this to configure in configuration file.

To add a hosted collector and HTTP source, do the following:

1. To create a new Sumo Logic Hosted Collector, perform the steps in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Add an [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).
3. In **Advanced Options for Logs**, under Timestamp Format, click **Specify a format** and enter the following:
   * Specify **Format** as `epoch`
   * Specify **Timestamp locator** as `\"timestamp\": (.*),`
4. Click **Add**.


### Step 2: Getting a token from the Netskope Portal (DEPRECATED)

Netskope REST APIs use an auth token to make authorized calls to the API. This section demonstrates how to obtain a token from the Netskope user interface (UI).

To obtain a Netskope auth token, do the following:

1. Login to Netskope as the Tenant Admin.
2. Go to the API portion of the Netskope, **Settings** > **Tools** > **Rest API**.
3. Copy the existing token to your clipboard, or you can generate a new token and copy that token.


### Configuring a Sumo Logic Netskope collector (DEPRECATED)

This section provides walkthrough instructions that demonstrate how to configure a Sumo Logic Netskope collector.
The sumologic netskope collector is compatible with Python 3.7 and Python 2.7. It has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Debian 4.9.130.

To create a Sumo Logic Netskope collector, do the following:
1. Login to a Linux machine.
2. Install the collector using the following command. If pip (python package installer) is not installed on your system, see the pip [docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for instructions on how to download and install pip.
   ```
   pip install sumologic-netskope-collector
   ```
3. Download the [netskope.yaml](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appdevstore/netskope.yaml) configuration file and place in the home directory.  
4. Edit the netskope.yaml file in the following way:
    * Replace `<SUMO HTTP SOURCE ENDPOINT>` with the Sumo Logic HTTPS Source endpoint you created in [Step 1](#step-1-adding-a-hosted-collector-and-http-source-deprecated).
    * Replace `<Netskope API Token>` with the Netskope API token you created in [Step 2](#step-2-getting-a-token-from-the-netskope-portal-deprecated).
    * Replace `<Netskope Domain>` with your Netskope domain name.<br/>Example of an edited netskope.yaml file:
     ```yml
     Netskope:
      TOKEN: "ExampleTokenGxrtwdshciB7gHR7efDQbZPW"
      NETSKOPE_EVENT_ENDPOINT: https://example.goskope.com/api/v1/events
      NETSKOPE_ALERT_ENDPOINT: https://example.goskope.com/api/v1/alerts
     SumoLogic:
      SUMO_ENDPOINT: "https://collectors.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/ZaVnC4dhaxxExampleEndpointxxx==="
     ```
5. Create a cron job to run the collector every 5 minutes, (use the crontab -e option) and add the following line:
   ```
   */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python -m \
   sumonetskopecollector.netskope > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

### Updating the Sumo Logic Netskope collector (DEPRECATED)

Sumo Logic periodically makes changes to the collector. To make sure your collector is up-to-date, perform the following tasks on each machine running the collector:

* Check the latest version of the Netskope collector on this page: [https://pypi.org/project/sumologic-netskope-collector/#history](https://pypi.org/project/sumologic-netskope-collector/#history)
* Check the version of the collector you have installed by running the following command: `pip show sumologic-netskope-collector`
* If you are not running the latest collector, do the following:
   1. Disable your cron job.
   2. Stop all existing collector processes.
   3. Run the following command to upgrade your collector:
    ```
    pip install sumologic-netskope-collector --upgrade
    ```
   4. Enable the cron job.

## Installing the Netskope App

This section demonstrates how to install the Netskope App, and provides examples and descriptions for each of the dashboards. The Netskope App has the following components:

* **Application Usage.** Insights into application usage; specifically by devices, users, users and traffic patterns.
* **Security Alerts.** Visibility into Netskope security alerts and violations and the ability to identify effects of a breach.  

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Netskope Dashboards

The Netskope dashboards are grouped by their component in the following two category folders:

* Application Usage
