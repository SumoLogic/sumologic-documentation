The Cylance App enables you to analyze Cylance security events by type, status, and detection method. You can use the App to investigate Cylance-specific events and provide operational visibility to team members without logging into Cylance.

Cylance applies artificial intelligence, algorithmic science, and machine learning to cyber security, and provides visibility to their service through integrations with a central security analytics platform like Sumo Logic. By combining the threat events data from Cylance and other data sources, you can reduce your security risk and improve your overall security posture.


## Log types

The Sumo Logic App for Cylance uses the supports the following event and log types:
* Device (Device Mgmt - Register, Remove, Updates, SystemSecurity)
* Threat (Threats identified and actioned)
* ScriptControl (Script Execution control and actions)
* ExploitAttempt (Memory Protection)
* Threat Classification (Threat classification by Cylance research team)
* AuditLog (User Actions performed from Cylance Web Console)
* DeviceControl (Control external device like USB, storage connected to system under monitoring)
* AppControl

For details on the format and definitions, refer to [Cylance](https://www.cylance.com/) documentation.

## Collecting Logs for the Cylance app

This procedure demonstrates how to collect logs from Cylance into Sumo Logic. Cylance applies artificial intelligence, algorithmic science, and machine learning to cyber security, and provides visibility to their service through integrations with a central security analytics platform like Sumo Logic. By combining the threat events data from Cylance and other data sources, you can reduce your security risk and improve your overall security posture.

The Sumo Logic App for Cylance allows you to analyze Cylance security events by type, status, and detection method. You can use the App to investigate Cylance-specific events and provide operational visibility to team members without needing to log into Cylance.


### Step 1: Configure a Collector

To create a new Sumo Logic Hosted Collector, perform the steps in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Step 2: Configure a Source

1. Perform the steps in [Configure a Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source#Configure_a_Cloud_Syslog_Source). and configure the following Source fields:
    1. **Name**. (Required) A name is required. Description is optional.
    2. **Source Category**. (Required) [Provide a realistic Source Category example for this data type.] The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources.
Example: **prod/web/apache/access**.
For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).
2. In the Advanced section, specify the following configurations:
    3. **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. True
    4. **Time Zone**. Logs are in UTC by default
    5. **Timestamp Format**. Auto Detect
3. Click **Save**.

Copy and paste the **token** in a secure location. You will need this when you configure Cylance Syslog Settings.


### Step 3: Configure Logging in Cylance

Before your can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must set up remote log streaming on Cylance. For instructions, refer to the following documentation:

1. In Cylance, go to **Settings > Application**.
2. In the **Integrations** section, activate the **Syslog/SIEM** check box.  
3. Under **Event Types**, activate the checkboxes for all events.  
4. For **SIEM**, select **Sumo Logic** as the destination.
5. For **Protocol,** select TCP.
6. Activate the check box **TLS/SSL**.
7. Enter your **IP/Domain**.
8. Enter your **Port**.
9. For **Severity,** select **Alert (1)**.
10. For **Facility,** select **Internal (5)**.
11. For **Custom Token,** enter the token from the Sumo Logic [Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source). The token should end with **@41123**. This number is the Sumo Logic Private Enterprise Number (PEN).
12. Click **Save**.

### Threat

The **Cylance - Threat** dashboard provides a high-level view of the threats experienced on your network. Dashboard panels display graphs and detailed information with the number of events, top event names, status, file types, unique threats, severity, hosts with the most threats, threat origination, classification, and blocked threats.

Use this dashboard to:
* Determine hosts (IP Address, device names) and zones affected by various threats identified and handled in the system.
* Monitor files affected with SHA occurring multiple times, and various paths of the files, to understand the threat footprint.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Cylance-Threat.png')} alt="Cylance dashboards" />


### Threat Classification

The **Cylance - Threat Classification** dashboard provides an insightful view of the types of threats experienced on your network. Dashboard panels are a mixture of graphs and detailed information on events, event names, threat class, subclass trends, safe files, malware files, and an event breakdown.

Use this dashboard to:
* Determine how threats in your organization are analyzed and classified by Cylance Research Team.
* Assess threats by classification: Malware, PUP - Potentially Unwanted Programs, Dual Use, Trusted Local, and Unknown.
* Identify Trusted - Local files and add them to your Safe List in Cylance. For more details on classification and subs-classification see the Cylance [documentation](https://home-support.cylance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009564987-What-are-Threat-Classifications-).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Cylance-Threat-Classification.png')} alt="Cylance dashboards" />


### Memory Exploit Attempts

The **Cylance - Memory Exploit Attempts** dashboard provides a high-level view of threats on your network that attempt to exploit memory. Dashboard panels show detailed information on events, violations, blocked and terminated processes, policies, users, hosts, actions, and event trends by action.

Whenever the agent detects certain hard-coded behaviors considered to be indicative of a compromise, an event is communicated to the service before the hooked API function is allowed to complete. The service then responds with an action for the agent to take, such as:

* Ignore the violation and let it execute
* Alert on the violation, but let it execute
* Block the violation and send an alert
* Terminate the process completely

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify the most common policy violations, processes and highly impacted systems in your environment.
* Monitor when, where, and what actions are taken with the configured policies in  your environment.
* Devise any necessary policies changes based on findings.

### Device

The **Cylance - Device** dashboard provides insights into the devices on your network that receive in threats. Dashboard panels provide information on unique device names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, users, hosts, operating systems, event names, and event trends.

Use this dashboard to:
* Analyze devices under protection by Cylance agent.
* Monitor new devices being registered, updated, and the policies assigned to them.
* Investigate devices that have been removed from protection.
* Assess whether to push the latest agent version, if any device is found running on old or outdated version.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/security-threat-detection/Cylance-Device.png')} alt="Cylance dashboards" />


### Device Control

The **Cylance - Device Control** dashboard provides insights into external devices involved in threats on your network. Dashboard panels provide graphs and detailed information on events, hosts, unique external devices, event and action trends, and device control event details.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor external devices (like USB mass storage device) connected to your environment.
* Assess which devices to connect to your systems.
* Grant and revoke access rights to specific devices, or a group of device categories.
* Monitor external devices by their Vendor ID, Product ID, and Serial Number.
* Define exceptions to the policy by vendor ID, as necessary.

You can set an exception for a Vendor ID. Use a Product ID and Serial Number for more specific exceptions.

### Script Control

The **Cylance - Script Control** dashboard provides insights regarding scripts on your network. Dashboard panels provide graphs and detailed information on events, devices, interpreters, users, zones, hosts, files, and event trends.

Script control injects into a script interpreter (responsible for the execution of scripts). By injecting into the interpreter, the agent is able to detect the script and script path before the script is executed.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor when, where, and how scripts are used in the environment. This ultimately reduces the attack surface on which an evildoer may distribute malware.
* Monitor and protect against scripts running in the environment.
* Monitor the interpreter version on your systems and decide to push latest version, when the system is running an out-dated version.
* Detect the script and script path before the script is executed.
* Monitor which scripts are getting blocked or executed with notification alerts.
* Change alert settings to block mode and only allow scripts to run out of specified folders, as necessary.

### AuditLog

The **Cylance - AuditLog** dashboard has easy to access information about audit logs for your network. Dashboard panels provide high-level graphs and detailed information showing the number of events, event names and trends, users and user geographic locations, source IPs, and a list of recent events.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor user activity performed from Cylance Web Console.
* Monitor users overriding, updating policies manually using Cylance Web Console.
