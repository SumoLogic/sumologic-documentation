[Twistlock](https://www.twistlock.com/) is a cloud native cybersecurity platform for hosts, containers, and serverless setups that ensures the protection of all your workloads across any environment.

The Sumo Logic App for Twistlock provides a comprehensive monitoring and analysis solution for detecting vulnerabilities and potential threats within your Kubernetes and containerized environments.


## Log Types

The Twistlock Apps work on logs from:

* Twistlock Console: Console logs typically include image scan, host scan, container scan, registry scan, scan summary, management audits, compliance violations, and vulnerability issues events.
* Twistlock Defender: Defender logs typically include container/host runtime audits, process activity audits, and incident events

For more information on Twistlock events, refer to the [Twistlock Documentation](https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/latest/audit/logging.html#events).

For Kubernetes customers, we recommend installing the Twistlock App.

For non-Kubernetes customers, we recommend installing the Twistlock Classic App.


## Collecting Logs for the Twistlock App

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic App for Twistlock. After completing the following tasks, you will have successfully configured log collection for Twistlock:

* Configure a Sumo Logic syslog source
* Send Twistlock logs to Sumo Logic


### Step 1. Configure a Sumo Logic syslog source

In this step you configure an installed collector with a Syslog source that will act as Syslog server to receive logs and events from Twistlock.

1. Configure an [Installed Collector for each Twistlock Console instance](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
2. Add a [Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/syslog-source) to the Installed Collector, and specify the following:
1. **Name**. (Required) A name is required.
2. **Description.** Optional.
3. **Protocol**. UDP or TCP.  Choose the protocol you configured in Twistlock Console for Syslog forwarding.
4. **Port**. Port number. Choose the port you configured in Twistlock Console for Syslog forwarding.
5. **Source Category**. (Required) Provide a Source Category for this data type. For example: **prod/twistlock**. For more information, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).
6. For Kubernetes customers, we recommend adding a [custom field](/docs/manage/fields.md) to the Syslog Source so you can reference it in the [Sumo Explorer view](/docs/observability/kubernetes). Each field contains a key-value pair, where the field name is the key. To add a field click the **+Add Field** link in the **Fields** section. You could add a field named **cluster** where you set the name of the cluster to tag to the logs. For example, **cluster** = **k8s.dev.sumo.sumologic.net**.
1. Click **Save**.


### Step 2: Send Twistlock logs to Sumo Logic


This step shows you how to configure Twistlock to send logs to the Sumo Logic syslog source.



1. Login to the Twistlock console.
2. Go to **Manage > System > Logging.**
3. Enable **Syslog**.
4. Enable both options under **verbose syslog output**.
5. Edit **Send syslog messages over the network to** with the syslog endpoint that you configured on Sumo Syslog Source in [Step 1](#Step_1._Configure_a_Sumo_Logic_syslog_source) above.
* Format to specify the endpoint:** ** `<protocol>://<server>:<port>`
* Example: `tcp://192.168.125.200:514`

## Installing the Twistlock Classic App

This section provides instructions on how to install the Twistlock Classic App, as well as examples of each of the dashboards. The App pre-configured searches and dashboards provide easy-to-access visual insights into your data.

This section shows you how to install the Twistlock Classic App.

To install the app, do the following:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.

Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see [Installing the Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).

3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
   * **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
   * **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source.
      * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list.
      * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`).
   * **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
