The Barracuda Web Application Firewall protects your web, mobile and API applications from being compromised, prevents data breaches, ensure protection from web attacks, provide control access and authentication.

The Barracuda WAF App analyzes traffic flowing through the Barracuda WAF and provides pre-configured dashboards that allow you to monitor WAF traffic as well to analyze various types of attacks detected both by Barracuda and Sumo Logic’s own [Threat Intelligence database](/docs/integrations/security-threat-detection/threat-intel-quick-analysis#03_Threat-Intel-FAQ#What_is_the_CrowdStrike_Integration_for_Sumo_Logic.3F).


## Log Types

The Barracuda WAF App uses the following log types:

* System Logs - Events generated by the Barracuda Web Application Firewall system.
* Web Firewall Logs - All actions and events on the web firewall. These logs help the administrator to analyze traffic for suspicious activity and fine tune the web firewall policies.
* Access Logs - All web traffic activities. These logs help the administrator obtain information about website traffic and performance.
* Audit Logs - The audit logs record the activity of the users logged in to the GUI of the Barracuda Web Application Firewall. These logs are used for administration purposes.
* Network Firewall Logs - The network traffic passing through the interfaces (WAN, LAN and MGMT) that matches the configured Network ACL rule. These log entries provide information on every packet that is allowed or denied by  Barracuda Web Application Firewall based on the Action specified in the ACL rule. This information helps identify where the network traffic originated, its destination, and the action applied.

## Collecting Logs for Barracuda WAF App

This section shows you how to configure collection for the Barracuda WAF App to use with the predefined searches and dashboards.

The Barracuda WAF App provides detailed analytics on system, firewall, and network security so you can protect your environment from malicious attacks. Security Analysis dashboards provide insights into the types of attacks, severity, malicious IPs, blocked and allowed content, and attacks by services. Traffic Analysis dashboards provide detailed information on client, server, and service traffic, as well as errors, bandwidth trends, and service performance.

### Step 1: Configure a Collector

To create a new Sumo Logic Hosted Collector, perform the steps in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Step 2: Configure a Source

Cloud syslog collection supports Barracuda Firmware version 9.2.1 or later. You must be running Barracuda Firmware version 9.2.1 or greater to use cloud syslog as an export server.

This section shows you how to configure a source for log collection. In this task you specify the Source Category metadata field, which is a fundamental building block for organizing and labeling sources.

To configure a source, do the following:
1. Perform the steps in [Configure a Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source#Configure_a_Cloud_Syslog_Source). and configure the following Source fields:
    1. **Name**. (Required) Enter a name. The description is optional.
    2. **Source Category**. (Required) Provide a realistic Source Category for this data type. For example: **prod/barracuda/waf**. For more information, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).
2. In the Advanced section, specify the following configurations:
    3. **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. True
    4. **Time Zone**. Logs are in UTC by default
    5. **Timestamp Format**. Auto Detect
3. Click **Save**.
4. Copy and paste the **token** in a secure location. You will need this when you configure Barracuda Cloud Syslog Settings.


### Step 3: Configure Logging in Barracuda WAF

This section shows you how to configure logging in Barracuda WAF for use with the preconfigured searches and dashboards of the Sumo Logic App for Barracuda WAF.

To configure logging in Barracuda WAF, do the following:
1. Log in to your Barracuda account and go to **ADVANCED > Export Logs.**
1. Go to the **Add Export Log Server.**
1. In the **Add Export Log Server** window, specify values for the following:
    1. **Name - **Enter a name for the SumoLogic service.
    2. **Log Server Type - ** Select Cloud Syslog Service.
    3. **IP Address or Hostname -** Enter the IP address or hostname of the SumoLogic service. For example: `syslog.collection.your_deployment.sumologic.com`
    4. **Port - **Enter the port associated with the IP address of the SumoLogic service. The default Port is 6514.
    5. **Token - **Enter the token for Sumo Logic service, such as: `9HFxoa6+lXBmvSM9koPjGzvTaxXDQvJ4POE/ExAMpleTOkenForTAsk3mSEKxPl0Q@41123`, where the number `41123` is the sumo PEN and is included as part of the customer token.
    6. **Log Timestamp and Hostname -** Click **Yes** to log the date and time of the event, and the hostname configured in the BASIC > IP Configuration > Domain Configuration section.
    7. **Comment -** (Optional) Enter a comment describing the setting.



1. Click **Add**.
2. Go to **ADVANCED** > **Export Logs.**
3. To send all logs to sumologic, in the **export log setting**, change the settings as shown in the following screenshot.
    1. **Export Log Settings - **Every Log should be marked as **Enable.**
    2. **Export Log Filters - **Select the severity as per the Logs that need to send. For example - if is set to 5-Notice, then logs with 0-5 are sent to the syslog server i.e, 0-Emergency, 1-Alert, 2-Critical, 3-Error, 4-Warning, 5-Notice
* 0-Emergency: System is unusable (highest priority)
* 1-Alert: Response must be taken immediately
* 2-Critical: Critical conditions
* 3-Error: Error conditions
* 4-Warning: Warning conditions
* 5-Notice: Normal but significant condition
* 6-Information: Informational messages (on ACL configuration changes)
* 7-Debug: Debug level messages (lowest priority)
1. **Syslog Settings - **Keep as default.


1. Click **Save**.
2. Go to **ADVANCED** > **Export Logs.**
3. In the **Logs Format** tab, make sure every Log format is set to **default** as the app support Default log formats.
