The Threat Intel Quick Analysis App correlates [CrowdStrike's](https://www.crowdstrike.com/sumologic/) threat intelligence data with your own log data, providing security analytics that helps you to detect threats in your environment, while also protecting against sophisticated and persistent cyber-attacks. The Threat Intel Quick Analysis App scans selected logs for threats based on **IP**, **URL**, **domain, Hash 256,** and** email**.


## Log Types

The Threat Intel Quick Analysis App can be used for any type of logs, regardless of format. Ideal log sources should include **IP**, **URL**, **domain**, **Hash 256**, and/or **email** information.


## Installing the Threat Intel Quick Analysis App

This app contains generic regex expressions and thus may not perform well at very large scale. Once you are familiar with Sumo Logic, you can apply performance optimization techniques as described in [Threat Intel Optimization](#threat-intel-optimization). Alternatively, you can run this app on smaller and more specific data streams.

This section provides instructions on how to install the Threat Intel Quick Analysis App, and examples of each of dashboards. The preconfigured searches and dashboards provide easy-to-access visual insights into your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

## Threat Intel Optimization

The Threat Intel Quick Analysis App provides baseline queries. You can further optimize and enhance these queries for the log and events types being scanned for threats. Use the following guidelines to customize your Threat Intel queries:

* Filter out unwanted logs before you use Threat Intel lookup operator
* Use keywords
* Use the `where` operator
* Use general search optimization [rules](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/best-practices-search.md)

For example:

```sql
_sourceCategory=cylance "IP Address"
| parse regex "(?<ip_address>\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
| where !isNull(ip_address)
| where ip_address != "0.0.0.0" and ip_address != "127.0.0.1"
| lookup type, actor, raw, threatlevel as malicious_confidence from sumo://threat/cs on threat=ip_address
```

### Field Extraction Rule

Use Field Extraction Rules (FER) to parse fields from your log messages at the time the messages are ingested, which eliminates the need to parse fields at the query level. Use these parsed fields along with Threat Intel Lookup operator.

1. Create the FER For example, for Cylance Security Events, create and use the following [FER:](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule)
```sql
parse "Event Type: *, Event Name: *, Device Name: *, IP Address: (*, *), File Name: *, Path: *, Drive Type: *, SHA256: *, MD5: *, Status: *, Cylance Score: *, Found Date: *, File Type: *, Is Running: *, Auto Run: *, Detected By: *" as event_type,event_name,device_name,src_ip,dest_ip,file_name,path,drive_type,sha,md5,status,score,found,file_type,isRunning,autoRun,detected
```

2. Customize your query so you can use parsed fields from FER with the Threat Intel Lookup operator, where `src_ip` is the parsed field from FER (see step # 1). For example:
```
| lookup type, actor, raw, threatlevel as malicious_confidence from sumo://threat/cs on threat=src_ip
| json field=raw "labels[*].name" as label_name
| replace(label_name, "\\/","->") as label_name
| replace(label_name, "\""," ") as label_name
| where  type="ip_address" and !isNull(malicious_confidence)
| if (isEmpty(actor), "Unassigned", actor) as Actor
| count as threat_count by src_ip, malicious_confidence, Actor,  _source, label_name
| sort by threat_count
```


### Scheduled View

Use scheduled views with the Threat Lookup operator to find threats. Scheduled View reduces aggregate data down to the bare minimum, so they contain only the raw results that you need to generate your data. Queries that run against Scheduled Views return search results much faster because the data is pre-aggregated before the query is run. And a Scheduled View query runs continuously, once per minute.

1. Create a scheduled view. For example, for Cylance, create a scheduled view, **cylance_threat**:
```
_sourceCategory=cylance | lookup type, actor, raw, threatlevel as malicious_confidence from sumo://threat/cs on threat=src_ip \
| json field=raw "labels[*].name" as label_name \
| replace(label_name, "\\/","->") as label_name \
| replace(label_name, "\""," ") as label_name \
| where  type="ip_address" and !isNull(malicious_confidence) \
| if (isEmpty(actor), "Unassigned", actor) as Actor \
| lookup latitude, longitude, country_code, country_name, region, city, postal_code, area_code, metro_code from geo://default on ip = src_ip \
| count as threat_count by src_ip, malicious_confidence, Actor,  _source, label_name, city, country_name, raw
```

2. Now, you can run your Threat Intel query on top of this view:
```sql
_view=cylance_threat \
| count by src_ip
```


## Threat Intel FAQ

#### What is the CrowdStrike Integration for Sumo Logic?

Sumo Logic has expanded its security offerings by allowing customers to analyze their logs for potential threats and indicators of compromise. In partnership with CrowdStrike, Sumo Logic maintains an updated Threat Intelligence database that can be correlated with log data through queries. The Sumo Logic / CrowdStrike integration has two parts:

* Sumo Logic maintains an up-to-date copy of CrowdStrike’s threat database.
* Sumo customers can now use the CrowdStrike database in threat analysis queries over their logs (through a new lookup operator).

The Sumo Logic Threat Intel lookup database is only available with Sumo Logic Enterprise and Professional accounts, or during a 30-day trial period. The Threat Intel lookup database is not available for Sumo Logic Free accounts.



#### What does the Threat Intel Quick Analysis App do?

This App scans all Sumo logs and parses (using regex) IP/Email/URL/Domain/File Name fields for comparison against the threat feed from CrowdStrike. Think of it as an Inner Join between parsed fields and the threat table.

This application can be slow to load depending on the volume of data you scan based on time, source category, etc.  We **highly recommend** that you apply additional filter conditions as you screen your logs or run these types of searches on a schedule.



#### How often do you refresh the threat feed from CrowdStrike?

The database is updated once per day. We have implemented a multi-layer cache for performance enhancements rather than returning to the master database on each query.


#### Can I export all of the threats from Sumo Logic?

No, we do not allow an export of the threat Intel feeds as that is confidential to CrowdStrike. However, we will match lookups from your logs against the entire threat database. You will ONLY see data returned when you have a match against the database to a specific threat from your log data (e.g IP, domain, email, etc.) via the threat lookup operator.


#### Is threat lookup real-time using Continuous Queries (CQs)?

Yes. You can scan for malicious Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) in real time using our [lookup](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/lookup-classic) operator.


#### Can I historically search my logs for threats?

Yes, you can search any log data that is still retained and searchable using the Sumo Logic Platform. However, we suggest customers break up historical searches into smaller and more manageable chunks based on time range and/or source category for performance reasons.


#### If I don't see any results in any Dashboard, is that a bad thing?

No. No results in your Dashboards can mean that nothing has been identified by CrowdStrike as a threat, verified or unverified.


#### I searched a threat feed for a hash IOC that I know exists, but it wasn't found. Why?

It could be a case-sensitivity issue. In Sumo, the equal sign (`=`) and the not equal to sign (`!=`) conditions are case-sensitive; when you use them with Sumo operators you may need to convert the string to which the condition is applied to upper or lower case. For more information, see [Using toLowerCase or toUpperCase with an equating condition](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/tolowercase-touppercase).


#### What are different Indicators of Compromise (IOC) types available?

The following IOC types are available from CrowdStrike:
* ip_address
* domain
* url
* email_address
* event_name
* x509_subject
* ip_address_block
* x509_serial
* binary_string
* service_name
* user_agent
* bitcoin_address
* file_path
* registry
* username
* file_name
* password
* campaign_id
* mutex_name
* hash_md5
* hash_sha1
* hash_sha256

#### Do IOCs and Threats expire?

IOCs and Threats will often remain in the system because an IOC, such as an IP address, could go dormant and they reappear as part of another threat. The last valid one can be found under **labels** > **Last_valid_on**. Be aware that over the period, their Malicious Confidence can be downgraded or upgraded depending upon recent activity.


#### I found an IOC in VirusTotal (or any other third-party threat feed), but I can’t find that IOC in CrowdStrike using the Sumo Logic Lookup?

CrowdStrike focuses on quality versus quantity when it comes to threat assessment. They have a dedicated Intel Team which does that work. A threat from a third-party feed may not be present in CrowdStrike threats because it has been rejected by the CrowdStrike Intel assessment Team.


#### I found threats in my network, now what do I do? How do I get more context about threats?

The next step would be to look at the raw JSON field from the query. Fields such as ip_address_types, labels, relations, and malware_families in the JSON object provide more contextual information about threats.


```
{
"indicator": "104.198.196.36",
 "type": "ip_address",
 "last_updated": 1476946769,
 "published_date": 1476946767,
 malicious_confidence": "unverified",
 "reports": [],
 "actors": [],
 "malware_families": [ ],
 "kill_chains": [],
 "domain_types": [],
 "ip_address_types": [
   "SSHScanner"
 ],
 "relations": [],
 "labels": [
   {
     "name": "ThreatType/Suspicious",
     "created_on": 1476946768,
     "last_valid_on": 1476946768
   },
   {
     "name": "IPAddressType/SSHScanner",
     "created_on": 1476946768,
     "last_valid_on": 1476946768
   }
 ]
}
```

With the malware family and other information, the user can search the internet for more as there is often data readily available on known threats. In addition, if the users would like more robust information, they can contact CrowdStrike directly and purchase individual reports or discuss upgrading to CrowdStrike Premium which includes more detailed reports.


#### What are Actors?

Threats are grouped by actors, which are based on location. Some threats are tied to nation-state actors. For instance, “Panda” is the umbrella term for all nation-state activity tied to the People’s Republic of China. Non-nation-state-based threats are categorized by intention, not location; for instance, activist groups like the Syrian Electronic Army are categorized as “Jackal,” which expresses both intent and motivation. The following is the cryptonym system that CrowdStrike uses for threats categorization:

* **Nation-State-Based threats**
    * Panda = China
    * Bear = Russia
    * Kitten = Iran
    * Tiger = India
    * Chollima (a mythical winged horse) = North Korea
* **Non-Nation-State threats**
    * Jackal = Activist groups
    * Spider = Criminal groups

[https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/meet-the-adversaries/)


#### What is Unverified Malicious Confidence?

About 20% of the indicators are unverified. These unverified threats may be real threats, but the CrowdStrike team has not been able to assign a confidence level to them, so they remain in the unverified state.

Unverified is usually an IP address related to a known bad adversary (like Deep Panda) and it’s an IP that was used at some point in that campaign. As we all know - IPs are dynamic. While Deep Panda utilized IP 201.22.52.32 at some point, it doesn’t mean that IP should be marked as bad or a threat, so we label it unverified. It’s more informational than actionable. CrowdStrike is looking at better ways to vet those IPs, for now it’s unverified. CrowdStrike advises customers not to do anything with those IPs unless they’re seeing malicious activity from one of them. If the state is ever updated, CrowdStrike will change the “last updated” timestamp and the new state will appear. In the meantime, users should treat them as possible candidates for analysis.

CrowdStrike recommends that you start with the highest priority and work down the chain.


#### I already have parsed fields such as IPs, domain, URL, Email, or File Name. Can I use them with this App, instead of parsing each log line again?

Yes, you can customize the query with in the App. For example:

```
_sourceCategory= */*/FIREWALL or _sourceCategory=*/*/LB or _sourceCategory=*/*/ROUTER or _sourceCategory=*/*/WINDOWS or _sourceCategory=*/*/SERVER
| where Your_IP != "0.0.0.0" and Your_IP != "127.0.0.1"
| lookup type, actor, raw, threatlevel as malicious_confidence from sumo://threat/cs on threat=Your_IP
| where  type="ip_address" and !isNull(malicious_confidence)
| if (isEmpty(actor), "Unassigned", actor) as Actor
| count by Actor
```



#### Should I use all logs (`*`) with this App or subset of logs, what's the recommendation?

You can use (`*`) to scan all of your ingested logs for threat, but depending on the volume of logs it can impact the performance of the search query and the App.

For optimal performance, use a subset of the logs. For example:
```
_sourceCategory= */*/FIREWALL or _sourceCategory=*/*/LB or _sourceCategory=*/*/ROUTER or _sourceCategory=*/*/WINDOWS or _sourceCategory=*/*/SERVER
```

#### I am seeing noisy results in the lookup service, what do I do?

* Use filters to remove as much of the noise as possible (eg use the NOT clause before passing tuples to the lookup operator)
* Use the "labels" section of the raw field to retain results of interest, or throw away results that are not useful. For example, IPs related labels `TorProxy` or `njRAT` can be noisy and filtered out by customizing queries like:

```
| parse regex "(?\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
| where ip_address != "0.0.0.0" and ip_address != "127.0.0.1"
| lookup type, actor, raw, threatlevel as malicious_confidence from sumo://threat/cs on threat=ip_address
| json field=raw "labels[*].name" as label_name
| replace(label_name, "\\/","->") as label_name
| replace(label_name, "\""," ") as label_name
| where type="ip_address" and !isNull(malicious_confidence)
| where !(label_name matches "*TorProxy*")
| if (isEmpty(actor), "Unassigned", actor) as Actor
| count by ip_address, malicious_confidence, Actor,  _source, label_name
| sort by _count
```


Threat Intel App is a good starting point, but every customer will have to customize the queries powering the app for their own particular use.


#### Can I use Scheduled Search with Threat Lookup service? If yes, what is the Run Frequency (time) I can use?

Yes, you can run scheduled searches that can be set up with a run frequency of Real Time or a longer time interval if desired.


#### Can I bring my own threat feed into Sumo Logic?

This isn't currently available as an App. You could create your own [lookup](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/lookup-classic) using a shared file.


#### What do I do if I find a bad IP (malicious level = high)?

You can further investigate bad IP triggers by updating your query to check the port as well and see if it is also identified as a malicious port.


#### Can you explain different fields in the raw JSON object?

## Viewing Threat Intel Quick Analysis Dashboards

All Dashboards include filters that you can use in Interactive Mode for further analysis of your Threat Intel Quick Analysis data. Because the Threat Intel Quick Analysis has the most bearing on recent threats, most panels are set to the 15 minute time range. You can adjust time ranges as needed.

Live mode and real-time queries are not supported for dashboards at this time.
