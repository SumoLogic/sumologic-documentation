The Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector Insights app provides comprehensive monitoring and observability for your OpenTelemetry Collector instances. Monitor collector performance, telemetry data flow, resource utilization, and troubleshoot data collection issues with preconfigured dashboards and alerts. Track metrics and logs to ensure your telemetry pipeline is running smoothly and efficiently.

This app supports OpenTelemetry Collector version `0.130.1-sumo-0` and later versions.

We use the OpenTelemetry collector's built-in internal telemetry capabilities to collect metrics and logs about the collector itself. By default, the Collector exposes its own telemetry through internal metrics (via Prometheus interface on port 8888) and logs (emitted to stderr). The collector can also be configured to export its own telemetry data (metrics and logs) to Sumo Logic through OTLP/HTTP endpoints.

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for OpenTelemetry Collector Insights

Following are the [fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of OpenTelemetry Collector Insights app installation, if not already present.

- `sumo.datasource`. Has fixed value of `otel_collector`.
- `_contentType`. Has fixed value of `OpenTelemetry`.
- `deployment.environment`. User configured. Enter a name to identify your deployment environment.

## Prerequisites

### For OTLP endpoint configuration


Before configuring the OTEL Collector integration, you need to create an OTLP source in your Sumo Logic hosted collector. The OTLP source will provide the endpoint URL that the OTEL Collector will use to send telemetry data. Learn more at [Creating a Sumo Logic OTLP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/otlp/).

### For metrics collection

The OpenTelemetry Collector must be configured to export its own metrics using the built-in telemetry capabilities. This requires:
- OpenTelemetry Collector version 0.130.1-sumo-0 or later
- Collector configured with telemetry metrics enabled at `detailed` level
- Access to OTLP endpoint for metrics export
- Internal metrics exposed on port 8888 (default)

### For logs collection

The OpenTelemetry Collector must be configured to export its own logs using the built-in telemetry capabilities. This requires:
- Collector configured with telemetry logs enabled at `debug` level (automatically configured in the provided template)
- JSON encoding for structured log output (automatically configured in the provided template)
- Access to OTLP endpoint for logs export

### System Requirements

- OTEL Collector v0.130.1-sumo-0 or later
- Sufficient system resources (CPU, memory) for data processing
- Proper permissions for the collector service to access configured resources


## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up collector

import SetupColl from '../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

### Step 2: Configure integration

OpenTelemetry works with a [configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) YAML file with all the details concerning the data that needs to be collected.

In this step, you will configure the OpenTelemetry Collector's built-in telemetry to monitor itself.

Below are the inputs required:

- **OTLP Endpoint**. Your Sumo Logic OTLP endpoint URL.


```yaml
service:
  telemetry:
    logs:
      level: debug
      development: false
      encoding: json
      processors:
        - batch:
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: http/protobuf
                endpoint: ${OTLP_ENDPOINT}/v1/logs
    metrics:
      level: detailed
      readers:
        - periodic:
            exporter:
              otlp:
                protocol: http/protobuf
                endpoint: ${OTLP_ENDPOINT}/v1/metrics
    resource:
      _contentType: OpenTelemetry
      sumo.datasource: otel_collector
      deployment.environment: ${DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT}
```

You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo Logic.

## Viewing OpenTelemetry Collector Insights dashboards

All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard. Use these filters to drill down and examine the data to a granular level.
- You can change the time range for a dashboard or panel by selecting a predefined interval from a drop-down list, choosing a recently used time range, or specifying custom dates and times. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/set-custom-time-ranges/).
- You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filtering Dashboards with Template Variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables/).
- **Log-based dashboards** use the `_sourceHost` filter to identify specific collector instances.
- **Metrics-based dashboards** use the `service.instance.id` filter to identify specific collector instances.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

##### Collector connection failure

If your collector fails to connect to Sumo Logic, you may need to configure proxy settings. Check the collector's logs for connection errors:

```bash
# On systemd systems
journalctl --unit otelcol-sumo

# Look for errors like "Unable to get a heartbeat"
```

##### High queue utilization

Monitor the `otelcol_exporter_queue_size` and `otelcol_exporter_queue_capacity` metrics. If the queue is consistently full, you may need to:
- Reduce data ingestion rate
- Increase queue capacity
- Scale horizontally with more collectors

##### Data dropping

Watch for logs containing "Dropping data because sending_queue is full" and monitor failed enqueue metrics:
- `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_spans`
- `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_metric_points` 
- `otelcol_exporter_enqueue_failed_log_records`

### Accessing collector metrics directly

By default, the collector's internal metrics are available in Prometheus format at `http://localhost:8888/metrics`. You can access them using:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/metrics
```

### Log levels and configuration

Configure different log levels for troubleshooting:
- **DEBUG**. Most verbose, includes detailed trace information
- **INFO**. Standard operational information (default)
- **WARN**. Warning messages about potential issues
- **ERROR**. Error conditions that need attention
