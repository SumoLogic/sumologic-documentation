The Sumo Logic app for Security Analytics provides Dashboards that allow you to easily see and manage your system's status, including a security operations overview, network, system and change, user monitoring, and vulnerabilities on endpoints. This data is collected from your Collectors and Sources, and Sumo Logic Anomaly Detection is applied to it, for instant analysis of any events.

For complete details, see [Sumo Logic App for Security Analytics](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/security-analytics).


### Getting Security Incident Details

In the Security Analytics App, on the Network Status Dashboard, the Incident Count or Incidents for Review Panels provide information on all security incidents. You can also drill down from these Panels to the Search page and see more details on those incidents in the Messages tab.  

**To see incident details in the Messages tab:**

1. Click the **Incidents for Review Panel **to open the query in the Search page.
2. Click the **Messages** tab.
3. More details for the incident are included in the Message field.
