The Data Volume App provides you with a summary and detailed views of your account's data usage volume by data type, tier, category, collector, source name, and hosts via predefined searches and dashboards.

Before you can install and use the Data Volume app, an administrator must first enable the feature. For more information, see [Enable the Data Volume Index](#enable-the-data-volume-index) below.

The Data Volume Index gathers volume data as soon as it is enabled. It will not gather data from legacy versions or backfill data.


## Enable the Data Volume Index

The Data Volume Index must be enabled by an administrator.

To enable the Data Volume Index:

1. Go to the **Administration** > **Account** > **Data Management** page.
1. Under **Data Volume**, select **Enable**.

A message confirms that the feature is enabled.

## Installing the Data Volume app

import AppInstallNoDataSourceV1 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-sumo-apps.md';

<AppInstallNoDataSourceV1/>

## Viewing Data Volume Dashboards

For each panel in a dashboard, you can perform the following actions:
* To display details for the panel time range, hover over the text in the top right corner.
* To zoom into a panel for more information, click the magnifying glass icon in the header.


### Overview

The **Data Volume - Overview** dashboard helps you understand your ingest in terms of Logs (by Tiers), Metrics, and Tracing capabilities.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify the top sources, collectors, or hosts by ingesting data volume across logs, metrics, and traces

### Logs

The largest data ingest typically comes from log volumes. The **Data Volume - Logs** dashboard allows you to view your log ingest volume by tier by ingesting spikes, outliers, and quota.

Use this dashboard to:
* Determine the log ingest volume and trends in GB across various tiers.
* Identify spikes where current hour ingestion is above 50% from the last hour. Identify outliers and forecast your data ingestion.
* Determine the log data for default index and top non-default indexes.
* Compare current ingestion to capacity and review any overages. You must configure the “Daily_Log_Ingest_Capacity” variable based on your Account Subscription. If you have  Credit based plan, please check with your account executive to determine these values for your account. Otherwise, see **Administration > Account > Account Overview** to get your capacity values.

### Data Volume Logs by Metadata Fields

The **Data Volume - Logs** by Metadata Fields dashboard allows you to view log ingest volume by tier, source categories, collectors, and hosts.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify the top 5 sources categories, source hosts, and collectors by ingest volume
* Examine ingestion trends over time

### Metrics

The **Data Volume - Metrics** dashboard allows you to view your metrics ingested, identifies ingest outliers/spikes, and helps predict what ingestion is going to be.

Use this dashboard to:
* Determine the ingested DPM by various dimensions their
* Examine trends over time.
* Identify the spikes where current hour ingestion is above 50% from the last hour.
* Identify ingestion outliers and forecast data ingestion, analyze the comparison of your current ingestion to your capacity, and review any overages. You must configure the “Metric_DPM_Ingest_Capacity”  variable that needs to be configured based on Account Subscription. If you have a Credit-based plan, please check with your account executive to determine these values for your account. Otherwise, see **Administration > Account > Account Overview** to see your Capacity Values.

### Log Spikes

The **Data Volume - Log Spikes**  Dashboard helps you quickly identify significant increases in data ingested. Review details of your data ingested for logs.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify ingest outliers
* Determine the spikes for top sources compared with the previous day

### Capacity Utilization

The **Data Volume - Capacity Utilization** dashboard provides views of subscribed, actual, and percentage capacity utilization for logs and metrics.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify the log and metrics ingestion capacity of your subscription. You must configure the "Daily_Log_Ingest_Capacity" and “Metric_DPM_Ingest_Capacity” variables based on your plan with Sumo Logic. If you have a Credit-based plan, please check with your account executive to determine these values for your account. Otherwise, see **Administration > Account > Account Overview** to view the log ingest capacity value and metric DPM ingest capacity value.
* Identify the average ingestion and subscribed ingestion capacity by percentage for logs and metrics.

### Tracing

The **Data Volume - Tracing** dashboard provides views of your Tracing data ingest by billed bytes and span counts per minute.

Use this dashboard to:
* Determine the ingested billedBytes/spansCount for tracing and examine trends over time.
* Identify spikes in ingestion, where ingestion for the current hour is above by 50% from the last hour.
* Identify the outliers (and forecast your data ingestion).
* Identify the top 5 source categories, source hosts, sources, and collectors by span count and billed bytes.
