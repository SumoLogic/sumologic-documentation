The Data Volume allows you to view at a glance your account's data usage volume by category, collector, source name, and hosts. The app uses predefined searches and a Dashboard that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

Before you can use the Data Volume app, an administrator must first enable the feature. For more information, see Enable and Manage the Data Volume Index.

Once the Data Volume Index is enabled, volume data is not back filled to any time before the feature was enabled. Data is only provided from the time the feature is enabled forward.

## Installing the Data Volume Legacy App

Your administrator must enable Data Volume from **Administration > Account > Data Management** before you can install this app.

The Data Volume Index gathers volume data as soon as it is enabled. It will not backfill data.

1. From **App Catalog**, search for the **Data Volume** app.
2. Click **Data Volume**.
3. Click **Add to Library, **this will open a window. Within the window click on **Advanced** and choose a location to install the app.
4. If **Data Volume Logging** is not enabled, select the toggle to enable it. Otherwise, the application will have no data to display. If the feature is already enabled, the toggle does not appear.
5. Choose a location for Data Volume in your **Personal** folder.
6. Click **Add to Library**. A dialog will confirm the app is installed successfully.


## Viewing Data Volume Legacy Dashboards

For each Panel in the Dashboard, you can perform the following actions:
* To display details on the Panel time range, hover over the text in the top right corner.
* To zoom into the Panel for more information, click the magnifying glass icon in the header.


### Overview

The **Data Volume - Overview** dashboard helps you understand how much data you are ingesting, and the collectors and source categories that contribute the most to ingested data volume.

Sumo Logic bills according to your total volume. The top half of the **Data Volume - Overview** dashboard presents information about log data volume; the bottom half covers metrics. From this dashboard, you can use the Ingest panels to drill down to more detailed dashboards on logs and metrics.

### Logs

The greatest data ingest typically comes from log volumes. From the **Data Volume - Logs** dashboard you can see your log ingest volume in greater detail, outlining ingest spikes, outliers, and quota.
