The Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM app gives you visibility into what’s going on in Cloud SIEM Enterprise. The app dashboards present high-level and detailed views into the Records that were created, the Signals that have fired, and the Insights generated by CSE. You can also get insight in CSE rules, including rule management activity, and which rules have fired.

Watch this micro lesson to learn more about the Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM app.

## Log types

The Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM App relies on data that is already available in Sumo Logic, so you don’t need to configure data collection.


### CSE Records  

CSE Records are stored in the following Sumo Logic partitions:

* sec_record_audit
* sec_record_authentication
* sec_record_email
* sec_record_endpoint
* sec_record_failure
* sec_record_network
* sec_record_notification


### CSE Signals

CSE Signals are stored in the following partition:

* sec_signal


### CSE Insights

CSE Insight activity is written to these Audit Event Index partitions:

* sumologic_audit_events — User actions performed on Insights
* sumologic_system_events — System actions performed on Insights are logged

Logs written to either of the partitions above are assigned the source category cseinsight. Note that the Audit Event Index contains logs for a variety of Sumo Logic subsystems, so when searching either partition for Insights, include the source category in your search scope.


## Install the App

1. From the App Catalog, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations).
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
   * **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
   * **Advanced**. Select the Location in Library (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal **folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## View App Dashboards

### Insight Trainer

This dashboard offers suggestions for making adjustments to rules, such as writing rule tuning expressions and changing severities. Implementing the recommendations causes rules to be more effective at creating high-fidelity Signals, resulting in generation of more meaningful Insights. For more information, see [Improve Rules with Insight Trainer](/docs/cse/rules/insight-trainer).
