The Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM app gives you visibility into what’s going on in Cloud SIEM. The app dashboards present high-level and detailed views into the Records that were created, the Signals that have fired, and the Insights generated by Cloud SIEM. You can also get insight in Cloud SIEM rules, including rule management activity, and which rules have fired.

Watch this micro lesson to learn more about the Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM app.

## Log types

The Enterprise Audit - Cloud SIEM App relies on data that is already available in Sumo Logic, so you don’t need to configure data collection.


### Cloud SIEM Records  

Cloud SIEM Records are stored in the following Sumo Logic partitions:

* sec_record_audit
* sec_record_authentication
* sec_record_email
* sec_record_endpoint
* sec_record_failure
* sec_record_network
* sec_record_notification


### Cloud SIEM Signals

Cloud SIEM Signals are stored in the following partition:

* sec_signal


### Cloud SIEM Insights

Cloud SIEM Insight activity is written to these Audit Event Index partitions:

* sumologic_audit_events. User actions performed on Insights
* sumologic_system_events, System actions performed on Insights are logged

Logs written to either of the partitions above are assigned the source category cseinsight. Note that the Audit Event Index contains logs for a variety of Sumo Logic subsystems, so when searching either partition for Insights, include the source category in your search scope.

### Insight Trainer

The **Cloud SIEM - Insight Trainer** dashboard offers suggestions for making adjustments to rules, such as writing rule tuning expressions and changing severities. Implementing the recommendations causes rules to be more effective at creating high-fidelity Signals, resulting in generation of more meaningful Insights. For more information, see [Improve Rules with Insight Trainer](/docs/cse/rules/insight-trainer).
