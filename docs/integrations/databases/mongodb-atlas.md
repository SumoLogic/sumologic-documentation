The Sumo Logic app for MongoDB Atlas allows you to monitor database operations, performance KPIs and provides visibility into the security posture of your clusters with the following dashboard types:  

* **Operations** Dashboard. For monitoring database operations and cluster health.
* **Performance** Dashboard. For insights into slow queries, database and hardware metrics.
* **Security** Dashboard. For visibility into user logins, audit events, project and organizational activity, incoming threats, and IOCs.

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) is a global cloud database service designed specifically for cloud-based applications. MongoDB Atlas runs in AWS, Azure, or GCP environments, with guaranteed availability, scalability, and compliance with data security and privacy standards.

The MongoDB Atlas app supports MongoDB Version 3.4 and above.

## Log and metric types

MongoDB Atlas uses logs and metrics. MongoDB Atlas logs are in JSON format and metrics are in Carbon 2.0 format. The Sumo Logic app for MongoDB Atlas uses five types of logs and two types of metrics.

### Sample log messages

MongoDB Atlas logs are all in JSON format and metrics are in Carbon2.0 format. The MongoDB Atlas utilizes five types of logs and two types of metrics. This section provides examples of the log types utilized by the MongoDB Atlas app.

The Sumo Logic `mongodbatlas` collector enhances logs by adding a few metadata fields. For this reason, the raw logs from the MongoDB Atlas API may differ in format.

Some logs are not available for some cluster tier. Check the [MongoDB docs](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/free-shared-limitations/). Some log types like for mongos instances are available for shared cluster only.

## Collecting logs and metrics for the MongoDB Atlas app

This section explains how to collect logs from MongoDB Atlas for mongo version 6.0 and ingest them into Sumo Logic for use with the MongoDB Atlas app predefined dashboards and searches. Most of the panels for this app work for logs coming in from mongo version 4.4 and 5.

Sumo Logic provides a solution which pulls logs and metrics from MongoDB Atlas with API calls. You can configure the log types to be collected, and the logs and metrics are then forwarded to Sumo Logicâ€™s HTTP endpoint.

By default, the collection starts from the current date and time, but this setting is also configurable. For more information, see the [Advanced Configuration](#Advanced-Configuration) options.

### Step 1: Acquire Authentication Info from MongoDB Atlas Portal

This section shows you how to acquire MongoDB Atlas portal authentication information. Generate programmatic API Keys with project owner permissions using the instructions in the Atlas [documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#create-an-api-key-for-a-project). Then, copy the public key and private key. These serve the same function as a username and API Key, respectively.
1. Generate programmatic API Keys with project owner permissions using the instructions in the Atlas [documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/configure-api-access/#create-an-api-key-for-a-project). Then, copy the public key and private key. These serve the same function as a username and API Key respectively.
2. Specify the API key **Organization Member** permissions, under **Organization > Access Manager > API Keys**, as shown in the following example.
3. Go to **Project Settings** > **Access Manager** > **API Keys** and then click on **Invite To Project** to add the API key created above for this project as shown in the following example.
4. Specify **Project Data Access Read Only** permission, under **Project Settings > Access Manager > API Keys**, as shown in the following example.
5. Go to your project, click **Settings**, and copy the **Project ID**, as shown in the following example.
6. Go to your organization by using context dropdown at the top, click **Settings**, and copy the **Organization ID**.
7. Enable Database Auditing for the Atlas project for which you want to monitor logs, as described in [this Atlas document](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/database-auditing/#procedure). Leave **Database Auditing** set to **ON**, as shown in the following example.

### Step 2: Add a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source

This section demonstrates how to add a hosted Sumo Logic collector and HTTP Logs and Metrics source, to collect logs for MongoDB Atlas. When you configure the HTTP Source, make sure to save the HTTP Source Address URL. You will need this later to configure the configuration file.
1. Do one of the following:
   * If you already have a Sumo Logic Hosted Collector, identify the one you want to use; or
   * Create a new Hosted Collector as described in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Add two HTTP sources, one for logs and another for metrics.
3. Go to the source you created for ingesting logs, navigate to **Timestamp Format > Advanced Options**, and click **Specify a format**.
4. Enter the following information in the respective fields for the **log source**:
   * Timestamp Locator: `\"created\":(.*)`
   * Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'`
5. Click **Add**.
6. Enter the following information in the respective fields for the **metric source**:
   * Timestamp Locator: `\"created\":(.*)`
   * Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'`
7. Click **Add**.


### Step 3: Configure Collection for MongoDB Atlas

In this section, we explore various mechanisms to collect database logs, events, metrics and alerts from MongoDB Atlas and send them to Sumo Logic, where they are shown in dashboards as part of the MongoDB Atlas app. You can configure Sumo Logicâ€™s MongoDB Atlas collector in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the AWS Lambda service, or by running a script on a Linux machine as a cron job. Choose the method that is best suited for you:
* [AWS Lambda-based collection](#step-3a-deploy-the-sumo-logic-mongodb-atlas-sam-application) via a Serverless Application Model (SAM) application
* [Script-based collection](#step-3c-configure-script-based-collection-for-mongodb-atlas) from a Linux machine

A single instance of the collector is responsible for collecting logs from a single project. Refer to [Configure Collection for Multiple Projects](#step-3b-configure-collection-for-multiple-projects-optional) if you have multiple projects.


#### Step 3A: Deploy the Sumo Logic MongoDB Atlas SAM application

In this section, you deploy the SAM application, which creates the necessary resources in your AWS account. To deploy the Sumo Logic MongoDB Atlas SAM application, do the following:
1. Go to [https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications).
2. Search for **sumologic-mongodb-atlas**, select the **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** check box, and click the app link when it appears.
3. When the Sumo Logic app page appears, click **Deploy**.
4. In the **AWS Lambda** > **Functions** > **Application Settings** panel, specify the following parameters in the corresponding text fields:
   * **HTTPLogsEndpoint**: Copy and paste the URL for the HTTP Logs source from this [Step 2](#step-2-add-a-hosted-collector-and-http-source).
   * **HTTPMetricsEndpoint**: Copy and paste the URL for the HTTP Metrics source from [Step 2](#step-2-add-a-hosted-collector-and-http-source).
   * **OrganizationID**: Copy and paste the Organization ID from [Step 1](#step-1-acquire-authentication-info-from-mongodb-atlas-portal).
   * **ProjectID**: Copy and paste the Project ID from [Step 1](#step-1-acquire-authentication-info-from-mongodb-atlas-portal).
   * **Private API Key**: Copy and paste the Private Key from [Step 1](#step-1-acquire-authentication-info-from-mongodb-atlas-portal).
   * **Public API Key**: Copy and paste the Public Key from [Step 1](#step-1-acquire-authentication-info-from-mongodb-atlas-portal).
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. Search for Lambda in the AWS console, select Functions tab and open the function just created.
7. Go to the **Configuration** > **Permissions** tab of the function, and click on the Execution role name link to open up the IAM window containing all the permission policies.
8. Click on **Add permissions** > **Create inline policy**. Choose JSON and copy this policy statement:
   ```json
   {
     "Version":"2012-10-17",
     "Statement":[
       {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
           "ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces",
           "ec2:CreateNetworkInterface",
           "ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface",
           "ec2:DescribeInstances",
           "ec2:AttachNetworkInterface"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
9. Click on **Review policy**, and provide an appropriate name. Then click on Create policy. Some users might already have these permissions enabled.
10. We then [follow these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/generate-a-static-outbound-ip-address-using-a-lambda-function-amazon-vpc-and-a-serverless-architecture.html)Â to create elastic IP/IPs for the lambda function and add a VPC to our function. We note down the elastic IPs.
11. We go to the mongo console, click on **Organization Access** > **Access Manager** > **API Keys**, and click on â€˜...â€™ of the API Key as mentioned in step 2. Then click on Edit Permissions.
12. Click **Next** > **Add Access List Entry**. Enter the elastic IPs noted above and, then click Save to save the elastic IPs, and click on Done to apply the settings.

The lambda function should be working now in sending logs to Sumo. You can check the CloudWatch logs in **Monitor** > **Logs** to see the logs of the function.

#### Step 3B: Configure Collection for Multiple Projects (optional)

This section shows you how to configure collection for multiple projects, assuming you are already collecting Atlas data for one project. This task requires that you do the following:
* Stop the collection of OrgEvents in the second SAM app deployment, because these events are global and are already captured by first collector.
* Change the `DBNAME` so that state (keys) maintained (bookkeeping) in the database (key value store) are not in conflict.

To configure collection for multiple projects, do the following:
1. [Deploy the MongoDB Atlas SAM application](#step-3a-deploy-the-sumo-logic-mongodb-atlas-sam-application) with the configuration for a new project.
2. After the deployment is complete, change the database name by adding environment variable (`DBNAME`) in [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html), as shown in the following example.
3. From the Lambda console, go to the **mongodbatlas.yaml** file and comment out `EVENTS_ORG`, as shown in the following example. This prevents the collection of org events, because they are already being collected by the first collector.

#### Step 3C: Configure Script-Based Collection for MongoDB Atlas

This section shows you how to configure script-based log collection for the Sumo Logic MongoDB Atlas app. The _sumologic-mongodb-atlas_ script is compatible with python 3.11 and python 2.7, and has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

:::note prerequisites
This task makes the following assumptions:
* You've successfully added a hosted collector and HTTP source, and copied the configuration parameters (ProjectID, OrganizationID, PublicKey and PrivateKey) from MongoDB Atlas console, as described in [Add a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source](#step-2-add-a-hosted-collector-and-http-source).
* You're logged into the user account with which you will install the collector. If not, use the following command to switch to that account: `sudo su <username>`.
:::

1. Configure/install the script on a Linux machine.
   * For Python 3, use:
     ```bash
     pip3 install sumologic-mongodb-atlas
     ```
   * For operating systems where the default python is not Python 3, use:
     ```bash
     /usr/bin/python3 -m sumomongodbatlascollector.main
     ```
2. To deploy the script on a Linux machine, do the following:
   1. If **pip** is not already installed, follow the instructions in the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to download and install **pip**.
   2. Log in to a Linux machine (compatible with either Python 3.11 or Python 2.7.
   3. Do one of the following:
      * For Python 2, run the following command:
  	    ```bash
        pip install sumologic-mongodb-atlas
  	    ```
      * For Python 3, run the following command:
	     ```bash
	     pip3 install sumologic-mongodb-atlas
	     ```
3. Create a `mongodbatlas.yaml` configuration file in the home directory and fill in the parameters as shown in the following example.
```bash title="mongodbatlas.yaml"
SumoLogic:
  HTTP_LOGS_ENDPOINT: <Paste the HTTP Logs source URL from step 2.>
  HTTP_METRICS_ENDPOINT: <Paste the HTTP Metrics source URL from step 2.>

MongoDBAtlas:
  ORGANIZATION_ID: <Paste the Organization ID from step 1.>
  PROJECT_ID: <Paste the Project ID from step 1.>
  PRIVATE_API_KEY: <Paste the Private Key from step 1.>
  PUBLIC_API_KEY: <Paste the Public Key from step 1.>
```
4. Create a cron job to run the collector every 5 minutes, (use the `crontab -e` option). Do one of the following:
   * **For Python 2**, add the following line to your crontab:
   ```bash
   */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python -m sumomongodbatlascollector.main > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   * **For Python 3**, add the following line to your crontab:
   ```bash
   */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python3 -m sumomongodbatlascollector.main > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```
5. Configuring collection for multiple projects (assuming you are already collecting Atlas data for one project). This task requires that you do the following:
   * Stop the collection of OrgEvents in the second SAM app deployment because these events are global and are already captured by first collector.
   * Change the `DBNAME` so that state (keys) maintained (bookkeeping) in the database (key value store) are not in conflict.
	 * [Configure the script on a Linux machine](#Configure_the_script_on_a_Linux_machine), then go to your configuration file.
	 * Change the `DB_NAME` and comment out `EVENTS_ORG` as shown in the following example.
    ```

### Troubleshooting

This section shows you how to run the function manually and then verify that log messages are being sent from MongoDB Atlas.

To run the function manually, do the following:
1. Enter one of the following commands:
   * For **Python 2**, use this command:
	 ```bash
	 python -m sumomongodbatlascollector.main
	 ```
   * For **Python 3**, use this command:
	 ```bash
	 python3 -m sumomongodbatlascollector.main
	 ```
2. Check the automatically generated logs in **/tmp/sumoapiclient.log** to verify whether the function is getting triggered or not.
3. If you installed the collector as `root` user and then run it as a normal user, you will see an error message similar to the following. This is because the config is not present in the home directory of the user that is running the collector. Switch to `root` user and run the script again.

You can also avoid this error by running the script with config file path as first argument.

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumomongodbatlascollector/main.py", line 190, in main
   ns = MongoDBAtlasCollector()
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumomongodbatlascollector/main.py", line 29, in __init__
   self.config = Config().get_config(self.CONFIG_FILENAME, self.root_dir, cfgpath)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumomongodbatlascollector/common/config.py", line 22, in get_config
   self.validate_config(self.config)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumomongodbatlascollector/common/config.py", line 34, in validate_config
   raise Exception("Invalid config")
Exception: Invalid config
```
