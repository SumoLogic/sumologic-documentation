The Cassandra app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health, and resource utilization of your Cassandra clusters. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into cluster health, resource utilization, cache/Gossip/Memtable statistics, compaction, garbage collection, thread pools, and write paths.

## Log types

The app supports Logs and Metrics from the open-source version of Cassandra. The app is tested on the 3.11.10 version of Cassandra.

Cassandra has three main logs, `system.log`, `debug.log`, and `gc.log` which hold general logging messages, debugging logging messages, and java garbage collection logs respectively.

These logs by default live in `${CASSANDRA_HOME}/logs`, but most Linux distributions relocate logs to `/var/log/cassandra`. Operators can tune this location as well as what levels are logged using the provided logback.xml file. For more details on Cassandra logs, see[ this](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/troubleshooting/reading_logs.html) link.

The Sumo Logic app for Cassandra supports metrics generated by the [Jolokia2 plugin for Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2). The app assumes prometheus format Metrics.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Cassandra

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Cassandra.

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using Cassandra in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_db_system`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster_address`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster_port`


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using Cassandra in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
* `component`
* `environment`
* `db_system`
* `db_cluster`
* `pod`
* `db_cluster_address`
* `db_cluster_port`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2: Configure Collection for Cassandra

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture).

The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Cassandra in a Kubernetes environment. In the architecture shown below, make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/databases/cassandra2.png')} alt="cassandra" />

The first service in the metrics pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Cassandra. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Jolokia2 input plugin to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins. The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you're using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/main/docs/v3-migration-doc.md).
:::

#### Configure Metrics Collection

Follow the steps listed below to collect Cassandra metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

1. Set up your [Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf).
2. On your Cassandra Pods, add the following annotations:
```sql
annotations:
 telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
 prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
 prometheus.io/port: "9273"
 telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]
  urls = ["http://localhost:8778/jolokia"]
  name_prefix = "cassandra_java_"
  [inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]
    environment = "prod"
    component = "database"
    db_system = "cassandra"
    db_cluster = "cassandra_on_premise"
    dc = "IDC1"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name  = "Memory"
  mbean = "java.lang:type=Memory"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name  = "GarbageCollector"
  mbean = "java.lang:name=*,type=GarbageCollector"
  tag_keys = ["name"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name=”OperatingSystem”
  mbean=”java.lang:type=OperatingSystem”
  paths = [“FreePhysicalMemorySize", "AvailableProcessors", "SystemCpuLoad", "TotalPhysicalMemorySize", "TotalSwapSpaceSize", "SystemLoadAverage"]
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]
  urls = ["http://localhost:8778/jolokia"]
  name_prefix = "cassandra_"
  [inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]
    environment="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
    component="database"
    db_system="cassandra"
    db_cluster="cassandra_on_premise"
    db_cluster_address = “ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED”
    db_cluster_port = “ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED”
    dc = "IDC1"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name  = "TableMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:name=*,scope=*,keyspace=*,type=Table"
  tag_keys = ["name", "scope","keyspace"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name = "DroppedMessageMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:name=*,scope=*,type=DroppedMessage"
  tag_keys = ["name", "scope"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name = "ClientMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Client,name=*"
  tag_keys = ["name"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name = "ThreadPoolMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=ThreadPools,path=*,scope=*,name=*"
  tag_keys = ["name", "scope", "path"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name = "CacheMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Cache,scope=*,name=*"
  tag_keys = ["name", "scope"]
  field_prefix = "$1_"
[[inputs.jolokia2_agent.metric]]
  name = "CommitLogMetrics"
  mbean = "org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=CommitLog,name=*"
  tag_keys = ["name"] field_prefix = "$1_"
```
Enter in values for the following parameters (marked ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED above):
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs` - This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf Cassandra Input plugin. Please refer to [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the Cassandra input plugin for Telegraf. As Telegraf will be run as a sidecar, the host should always be localhost.
   * In the input plugins section (`[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]`):
      * `urls` - The URL to the Cassandra server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Cassandra servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Cassandra input plugin for Telegraf.
   * In the tags section (`[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]`):
      * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Cassandra cluster identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
      * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Cassandra cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
      * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
      * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used


Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you  do not modify, as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrap: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section (`[inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]`):
        * `component: “database”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `db_system: “cassandra”` - This value identifies the database system.

:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses `“cassandra-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=cassandra-prod.sumologic.com
db_cluster_port=3306`.

If your application connects directly to a given Cassandra node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration:
`host=cassandra-prod.sumologic.com`.

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Cassandra address” Entities.
:::

  See [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
3. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.

#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Cassandra logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. Add labels on your Cassandra pods to capture logs from standard output on Kubernetes.
   1. Apply following labels to the Cassandra pods:
     ```sql
     environment: "<Ex prod, stag>"
     component: "database"
     db_system: "cassandra"
     db_cluster: "<Your_Cassandra_Cluster_Name>"--Enter Default if you do not have one.
     db_cluster_address: <your cluster’s hostname or ip address or service endpoint>
     db_cluster_port: <database port>
     ```
     Please enter values for the following parameters:
     * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Cassandra cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `db_cluster`- Enter a name to identify the Cassandra cluster. The cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

    **Do not modify the following values** as it will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
    * `component: “database”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
    * `db_system: “Cassandra”` - This value identifies the database system.
    * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
    * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used

:::note
db_cluster_address and db_cluster_port should reflect exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses `“cassandra-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows:
`db_cluster_address=cassandra-prod.sumologic.com
db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given Cassandra node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration:
`host=cassandra-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Cassandra address” Entities.
:::
  For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

2. (Optional) Collecting Cassandra Logs from a Log File on Kubernetes.
   1. Determine the location of the Cassandra log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the Cassandra logback.xml for your Cassandra cluster along with the mounts on the Cassandra pods.
   2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
   ```sql
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_Cassandra_log_file>/  <Cassandra_log_file_name>
   ```
  Example:
   ```sql
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/opt/bitnami/cassandra/logs/cassandra.log
   ```
   4. Make sure that the Cassandra pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <Cassandra_pod_name>
    ```
   5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
   6. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.

3. Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for Proxy Application Components. This step is not needed if one is using application components solution terraform script. To do so:
   1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
   3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear:
4. Enter the following options:
   * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Database**.
   * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
   * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
   * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression:  
    ```sql
    pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=database pod_labels_db_system=* pod_labels_db_cluster=*
    ```
   * **Parse Expression**. Enter the following parse expression:
   ```sql
   if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
   | pod_labels_component as component
   | pod_labels_db_system as db_system
   | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_db_cluster), pod_labels_db_cluster, null) as db_cluster
   ```
5. Click **Save** to create the rule.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

Cassandra metrics collection setup can be done in two ways.
* Using Telegraf and Installed Collector
* Using OpenTelemetry Collection

Both the methods require the Jolokia agent to collect metrics. The steps to configure Jolokia JVM Agent in Cassandra are as below:

1. Download the latest Jolokia JVM agent jar file (example: `jolokia-jvm-1.3.3-agent.jar`) from [here](https://jolokia.org/download.html).
2. Copy the downloaded jar file to Cassandra’s lib folder (example: `/usr/share/cassandra/lib`).
3. In `cassandra-env.sh` file, enable/add the following lines:
 ```bash
 # Jolokia javaagent
 JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -javaagent:$CASSANDRA_HOME/lib/jolokia-jvm-1.3.3-agent.jar"
 ```
4. Restart Cassandra service.

Below we have defined both the ways in which collection can be configured.

<details><summary>Method A: Using Telegraf and Installed Collector</summary>

We use the Telegraf operator for Cassandra metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Cassandra logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Cassandra collection in a non-Kubernetes environment. Telegraf runs on the same system as Cassandra, and uses the [Jolokia2 input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) to obtain Cassandra metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Cassandra on the other hand are sent to a Sumo Logic Local File source.

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Cassandra.

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[ Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source). Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. **Install Telegraf**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
4. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [jolokia2 input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.

  Create or modify telegraf.conf and copy and paste the text below:

Please enter values for the following parameters:
* In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs. jolokia2_agent]]`:
    * `urls` - The URL to the jolokia server. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Cassandra input plugin for Telegraf.
* In the tags section, which is `[inputs.Cassandra.tags]`:
    * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Cassandra cluster identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
    * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Cassandra cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
    * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
    * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you do not modify, as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
* In the tags section (`[inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]`):
    * `component: “database”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
    * `db_system: “cassandra”` - This value identifies the database system.

:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given Cassandra node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration:
`host=cassandra-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Cassandra address” Entities.
:::

* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
    * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
* **Do not modify the following values** as it will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
    * `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
    * `db_system: “cassandra”` - In the input plugins section:  This value identifies the database system.
    * `component: “database”` - In the input plugins section: This value identifies application components.
* For all other parameters please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/telegraf.conf) for more properties that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service). At this point, Cassandra metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Cassandra running on a non-Kubernetes environment.

By default, Cassandra logs are stored in a log file. Sumo Logic supports collecting logs from a local log file by using a [local file source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors). The installed collector will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-by-Deployment-and-Firewall-Security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for Installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements).

Based on your infrastructure and networking setup choose one of these methods to collect Cassandra logs and follow the instructions below to set up log collection:

1. **Configure logging in Cassandra**. Cassandra supports logging via the local text log files. Cassandra logs have the following levels of verbosity. To select a level, set loglevel to one of:
   * ALL
   * TRACE
   * DEBUG
   * INFO (Default)
   * WARN
   * ERROR
   * OFF

  To permanently add debug logging to a class permanently using the logback framework, use nodetool setlogginglevel to check you have the right class before you set it in the logback.xml file in install_location/conf. Modify to include the following line or similar at the end of the file:
   ```sql
   <logger name="org.apache.cassandra.gms.FailureDetector" level="DEBUG"/>
   ```
  Restart the node to invoke the change.
2. **Configure Cassandra to log to a Local file**. Cassandra provides logging functionality using Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) with a [logback](http://logback.qos.ch/) backend. Cassandra has three main logs, the `system.log`, `debug.log`, and `gc.log` which hold general logging messages, debugging logging messages, and java garbage collection logs, respectively.

  These logs, by default, live in `${CASSANDRA_HOME}/logs`, but most Linux distributions relocate logs to `/var/log/cassandra`. Operators can tune this location as well as what levels are logged using the provided logback.xml file.

  You can configure logging [programmatically](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) or manually. Manual ways to configure logging are:
    * Run the [nodetool setlogginglevel](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/tools/toolsSetLogLev.html) command.
    * Configure the `logback-test.xml` or `logback.xml` file installed with Cassandra.
    * Use the [JConsole](https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra-oss/3.0/cassandra/operations/opsMonitoring.html#opsMonitoringJconsole) tool to configure logging through JMX.

  Logs from the Cassandra log file can be collected via a Sumo Logic [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) and a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) as explained in the next section.
3. **Configure a Collector** To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page[ Configure an Installed Collector.](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors)
4. **Configure a Local File Source**. To collect logs directly from your Cassandra machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.
   1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
      * **Name.** (Required)
      * **Description.** (Optional)
      * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your log files. The files are typically located in `/var/log/cassandra/system.log`. If you are using a customized path, check the `logback.xml` file for this information.
      * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
      * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Cassandra/Logs**. The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices#good-and-bad-source-categories).
       * **Fields**. Set the following fields:
       * `component = database`
       * `db_system = cassandra`
       * `db_cluster = <Your_Cassandra_Cluster_Name>`
       * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod.
       * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
       * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
   3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
     * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
     * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your Cassandra Server’s time zone.
     * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
     * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
     * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
       * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
   4. Click **Save**.

At this point, Cassandra logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

<details><summary>Method B: Using OpenTelemetry</summary>

We use the Telegraf receiver of Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Distro [Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) for Cassandra metric collection and filelog receiver for collecting Cassandra logs. Sumo Logic OT distro runs on the same system as Cassandra, and uses the Cassandra Jolokia input plugin for Telegraf to obtain Cassandra metrics, and the Sumo Logic exporter to send the metrics to Sumo Logic.

#### Configure Metrics and Logs Collection  

1. Install sumologic-otel-collector by following the instructions for your operating system:
   * [Linux](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector-linux)
   * [macOS](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector-macos)
   * [Windows](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/install-collector-windows)
2. Configure and start sumologic-otel-collector. As part of collecting metrics data from Cassandra, we will use the [jolokia2 input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) for Telegraf to get data from otel and then send data to Sumo Logic. Create or modify config.yaml. Sample config is [here](https://ot-distro.s3.amazonaws.com/config_cassandra.yaml). Please enter values for the following parameters.
   * Enter Sumo Logic collection details in the section; extensions > sumologic by referring to [these](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/main/pkg/extension/sumologicextension) instructions. Configure details like collector name, category, install token, endpoint etc.
   * In the input plugins section, that is `[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]`:
     * **`urls`** - The URL to the jolokia server. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Cassandra input plugin for Telegraf.
   * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.Cassandra.tags]` and filelog section
      * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Cassandra cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
      * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Cassandra cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
   * In the exporter plugins section :
      * Enter details like `source_category` and `source_host`. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
   * **Do not modify the following values** as it will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
     * `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`  Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
     * `db_system: “cassandra”` - In the input plugins section:  This value identifies the database system.
     * `component: “database”` - In the input plugins section: This value identifies application components.
   * For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/telegraf.conf) for more properties that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
3. Run the Sumo Logic OT Distro using the below command
  ```bash
  otelcol-sumo --config config.yaml
  ```

At this point, Cassandra metrics and logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

## Installing Cassandra Monitors

:::note
This step is not needed if you are using the [Application Components Solution](/docs/observability/application-components) Terraform script.
:::

To install these monitors, you must have the **Manage Monitors** role capability. You can install monitors by importing a JSON file or using a Terraform script.

Sumo Logic has provided pre-packaged alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you proactively determine if a Cassandra cluster is available and performing as expected. These monitors are based on metric and log data and include pre-set thresholds that reflect industry best practices and recommendations. For more information about individual alerts, see [Cassandra Alerts](#Alerts).

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors#Rules) for details.

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/Memcached/Memcached.json) that describes the monitors.
2. The [JSON](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/Memcached/Memcached.json) contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all Cassandra clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.  

  However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `db_cluster=*` with `<Your Custom Filter>`. Custom filter examples:
    * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=dev-cassandra-01`.
    * For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with `cassandra-prod`, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=cassandra-prod*`.
    * For alerts applicable to specific clusters, within a production environment, your custom filter would be:`db_cluster=dev-cassandra-01` AND `environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.
3. Go to **Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors**.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Click **Import**.
6. On the **Import Content popup**, enter **Cassandra** in the Name field, paste the JSON into the popup, and click **Import**.
7. The monitors are created in a "Cassandra" folder. The monitors are disabled by default. See the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) topic for information about enabling monitors and configuring notifications or connections.

### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the **Manage Monitors** role capability. For instructions, see [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key_on_Preferences_page).
2. Download [Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later and install it.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Cassandra monitors. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic github [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/Memcached). You can either download it using the git clone command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration. After extracting the package, navigate to the  `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/Cassandra/` directory.
5. Edit the Cassandra.auto.tfvars file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key and Access ID from Step 1 and your Sumo Logic deployment. If you're not sure of your deployment, see [Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
```bash
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```
6. The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the `cassandra_data_source` variable. For example:
   * To configure alerts for a specific cluster, set `cassandra_data_source` to something like `db_cluster=cassandra.prod.01`
   * To configure alerts for all clusters in an environment, set `cassandra_data_source` to something like `environment=prod`
   * To configure alerts for multiple clusters using a wildcard, set `cassandra_data_source` to something like `db_cluster=cassandra-prod*`
   * To configure alerts for...A specific clusters within a specific environment, set `cassandra_data_source` to something like `db_cluster=cassandra-1` and `environment=prod`. This assumes you have configured and applied Fields as described [Configure Fields in Sumo Logic](#step-1-configure-fields-in-sumo-logic) step.

All monitors are disabled by default on installation. To enable all of the monitors, set the `monitors_disabled` parameter to `false`. By default, the monitors will be located in a "Cassandra" folder on the **Monitors** page. To change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in the folder variable in the `Cassandra.auto.tfvars` file.

7. If you want your alerts to send email or connection notifications, edit the `Cassandra_notifications.auto.tfvars` file to populate the `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` sections. Examples are provided below.

  In the variable definition below, replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection ID of the Webhook connection. You can obtain the Webhook connection ID by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

```bash title="Pagerduty connection example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

For information about overriding the payload for different connection types, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).
```bash title="Email notifications example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

8. To install the Monitors, navigate to the `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/Cassandra/` directory and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and download the required components.
9. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors that Terraform will create or modify.
10. Run `terraform apply`.

## Installing the Cassandra app

:::note
This step is not needed if you are using the [Application Components Solution](/docs/observability/application-components) Terraform script.
:::

This section demonstrates how to install the Cassandra app.

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection applies only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Advanced**. Select the Location in the Library (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click New Folder to add a new folder.
4. Click Add to Library.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or another folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
