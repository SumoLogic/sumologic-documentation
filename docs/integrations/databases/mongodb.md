MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. The Sumo Logic app for MongoDB supports logs and metrics from the open source version of MongoDB. The App is tested on the 4.4.4 version of MongoDB.


## Log Types

The MongoDB logs are generated in files as configured in the configuration file `/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log`. For more details on MongoDB logs, see [this](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/log-messages/) link.

The Sumo Logic App for MongoDB supports metrics generated by the [MongoDB plugin for Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mongodb). The app assumes prometheus format Metrics.


### Sample Log Message

```json
{
	"t":{
		"$date":"2021-05-21T10:22:57.373+00:00"
	},
	"s":"I",
	"c":"NETWORK",
	"id":51800,
	"ctx":"conn500659",
	"msg":"client metadata",
	"attr":{
		"remote":"127.0.0.1:49472",
		"client":"conn500659",
		"doc":{
			"application":{
				"name":"MongoDB Shell"
			},
			"driver":{
				"name":"MongoDB Internal Client",
				"version":"4.4.4"
			},
			"os":{
				"type":"Linux",
				"name":"PRETTY_NAME=\"Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)\"",
				"architecture":"x86_64",
				"version":"Kernel 4.4.0-62-generic"
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Sample Query  

```sql title="Dashboard: MongoDB - Errors and Warnings, Panel: Errors by Component"
environment=* db_cluster=* db_system=mongodb  | json "log" as _rawlog nodrop
| if (isEmpty(_rawlog), _raw, _rawlog) as _raw
| json field=_raw "t.$date" as timestamp
| json field=_raw "s" as severity
| json field=_raw "c" as component
| json field=_raw "ctx" as context
| json field=_raw "msg" as msg
| where severity in ("E")
| count by component
```


## Collecting Logs and Metrics for MongoDB

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic App for MongoDB.

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using MongoDB in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_db_system`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using MongoDB in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `component`
* `environment`
* `db_system`
* `db_cluster`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2: Configure Collection for MongoDB

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture).The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from MongoDB in a Kubernetes environment. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Prometheus, Fluentd and FluentBit.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/databases/mongodb-k8s.png')} alt="mongodb_on_k8s" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from MongoDB. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the MongoDB input plugin to obtain metrics. (For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.) The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator. We also have Fluentbit that collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to FluentD, which in turn sends all the logs and metrics data to a Sumo Logic HTTP Source.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/release-v2.0/deploy/docs/v2_migration_doc.md#how-to-upgrade).

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect MongoDB metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

1. [Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf).
2. On your MongoDB Pods, add the following annotations:
```sql
annotations:
  telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/port: "9273"
  telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
[[inputs.mongodb]]
  servers = ["mongodb://<username-CHANGEME>:<password-CHANGEME>@127.0.0.1:27017"]
  gather_perdb_stats = true
  gather_col_stats = true
  [inputs.mongodb.tags]
	environment="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
	component="database"
	db_system="mongodb"
	db_cluster="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
	db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
	db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
```
3. Please enter values for the following parameters (marked `ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED` above):
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs` - This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf MongoDB Input plugin. Please refer[ to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the MongoDB input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
     * In the input plugins section (`[inputs.MongoDB]`):
        * `servers` - The URL to the MongoDB server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple MongoDB servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mongodb) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the MongoDB input plugin for Telegraf.
     * In the tags section (`[inputs.MongoDB.tags])`:
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the MongoDB cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this MongoDB cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
				* `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
				* `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “mongodb-prod.sumologic.com:3306” as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given mongodb node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “MongoDB address” Entities.
:::
   * Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
     * `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
     * `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
     * `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
     * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
       * In the tags section (`[inputs.mongodb.tags]`):
         * `component: “database”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
         * `db_system: “mongodb”` - This value identifies the database system.
   * See [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
4. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
5. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect MongoDB logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **Add labels on your MongoDB pods to capture logs from standard output on Kubernetes**. Make sure that the logs from MongoDB are sent to stdout. For more details, see this [doc](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/log-messages/).
   1. Apply following labels to the MongoDB pods:
   ```sql
   labels:
       environment: "prod"
       component: "database"
       db_system: "mongodb"
       db_cluster: "mongodb_prod_cluster01"
   ```
   2. Enter in values for the following parameters:
     * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the MongoDB cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `db_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this MongoDB cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
		 * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
		 * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example if your application uses `“mongodb-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given mongodb node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com`.

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “MongoDB address” Entities.
:::
     * **Do not modify the following values** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
       * `component: “database”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
       * `db_system: “mongodb”`. This value identifies the database system.
     * See [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
2. **Collecting MongoDB Logs from a Log File (Optional)**. Follow the steps below to capture MongoDB logs from a log file on Kubernetes.
   1. Determine the location of the MongoDB log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the MongoDB.conf for your MongoDB cluster along with the mounts on the MongoDB pods.
   2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
    ```xml
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_MongoDB_log_file>/<MongoDB_log_file_name>
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
     annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/mongo-prim-data/MongoDB.log
    ```
   4. Make sure that the MongoDB pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe pod <MongoDB_pod_name>
     ```
   5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
3. **Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**. This step is not needed if one is using application components solution terraform script. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with `pod_labels`. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for Database Application Components. To do so:
   1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
   3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear:
   4. Enter the following options:
     * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Database**.
     * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
     * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
     * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression:
      ```sql
      pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=database \
      pod_labels_db_system=* pod_labels_db_cluster=*
      ```
     * **Parse Expression**.Enter the following parse expression:
      ```sql
      | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
      | pod_labels_component as component
      | pod_labels_db_system as db_system
      | pod_labels_db_cluster as db_cluster
      ```
4. Click **Save** to create the rule.

In non-Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf operator for MongoDB metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting MongoDB logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the MongoDB collection in a non-Kubernetes environment. Telegraf runs on the same system as MongoDB, and uses the [MongoDB input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mongodb) to obtain MongoDB metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from MongoDB on the other hand are sent to either a Sumo Logic Local File source or Syslog source.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/databases/mongodb_nonk8.png')} alt="mongodb" />

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic App for MongoDB.

#### Configure Metrics Collection

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following[ these instructions. ](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. **Install Telegraf**. Use the following steps [install Telegraf](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md).
   1. Configure and start Telegraf. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [MongoDB input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mongodb) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic. Create or modify telegraf.conf and copy and paste the text below:
    ```sql
    [[inputs.mongodb]]
		servers = ["mongodb://<username-CHANGEME>:<password-CHANGEME>@127.0.0.1:27017"]
		gather_perdb_stats = true
		gather_col_stats = true
		[inputs.mongodb.tags]
		environment="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
		component="database"
		db_system="mongodb"
		db_cluster="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
		db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
		db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
		[[outputs.sumologic]]
		url = "<CHANGEME>" -- HTTP Source URL you created in previous step
		data_format = "prometheus"
    ```
   2. Enter values for the following parameters (marked ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED above):
     * In the input plugins section, `[inputs.mongodb]`:
       * `servers` - The URL to the MongoDB server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple MongoDB servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/mongodb) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the MongoDB input plugin for Telegraf.
     * In the tags section, `[inputs.mongodb.tags]`
       * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the MongoDB cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
       * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this MongoDB cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
			 * db_cluster_address - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
			 * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses `“mongodb-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given MongoDB node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “MongoDB address” Entities.
:::
     * In the output plugins section, `[outputs.sumologic]`:
       * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
     * Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this Telegraf configuration that we request you **do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
       * `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, `[outputs.sumologic]`, metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
       * `component: “database”` - In the input plugins section, `[inputs.MongoDB]`, this value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
       * `gather_perdb_stats: “true”` - When true, collect per database stats.
       * `gather_col_stats: “true”` - When true, collect per collection stats.
     * See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/telegraf.conf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
   3. Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, MongoDB metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for MongoDB running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for MongoDB. By default, MongoDB logs are stored in a log file. MongoDB also supports forwarding logs via Syslog.

Sumo Logic supports collecting logs both via Syslog and a local log file. Utilizing Sumo Logic [Cloud Syslog](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/Cloud-Syslog-Source) will require TCP TLS Port 6514 to be open in your network. Local log files can be collected via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors). Installed collector will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for Installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements#Installed-Collector-Requirements).

Based on your infrastructure and networking setup choose one of these methods to collect MongoDB logs and follow the instructions below to set up log collection:

1. **Configure logging in MongoDB**. MongoDB supports logging via the following methods: syslog, local text log files and stdout. MongoDB logs have four levels of verbosity. All logging settings are located in [MongoDB.conf](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.setLogLevel/). To select a level, set `loglevel` to one of:
   * 0 is the MongoDB's default log verbosity level, to include [Informational](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/log-messages/#std-label-log-severity-levels) messages.
   * 1 to 5 increases the verbosity level to include[ Debug](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/log-messages/#std-label-log-severity-levels) messages.
2. Configure MongoDB to log to a Local file or syslog
   * **Configuring MongoDB logs to go to log files**. By default, MongoDB logs are stored in **/var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log**. The default directory for log files is listed in the MongoDB.conf file. To configure the log output destination to a log file, use one of the following settings, either in the [configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/) or command-line:
     * Configuration file: The [systemLog.destination](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-systemLog.destination) option for _file_.
     * Command-line:
		   * The [`--logpath`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--logpath) option for [mongod](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) for _file_.
       * The [`--logpath`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#std-option-mongos.--logpath) option for [mongos](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos) for _file_.

    Logs from the MongoDB log file can be collected via a Sumo Logic [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors) and a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) as explained in the next section.
   * **Configuring MongoDB logs to stream via syslog**. To configure the log output destination to syslog, use one of the following settings, either in the[ configuration file](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/) or command-line:
     * **Configuration file**: the [systemLog.destination](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#mongodb-setting-systemLog.destination) option for _syslog_.
     * **Command-line:**
		   * the [`--syslog`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#std-option-mongod.--syslog) option for[ mongod](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongod) for _syslog_.
       * the [`--syslog`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#std-option-mongos.--syslog) option for[ mongos](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#mongodb-binary-bin.mongos) for _syslog_.

    To capture MongoDB logs using syslog, configure a [syslog source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Syslog-Source) on an [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors) as explained in the next section.

3. **Configuring a Collector**. To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page [Configure an Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors).
4. **Configuring a Source**. To collect logs directly from your MongoDB machine, use a Local File Source and an Installed Collector.
   1. To add a Local File Source source for MongoDB, do the following:
      1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
      2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
         * **Name.** (Required)
         * **Description.** (Optional)
         * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log. If you're using a customized path, check the MongoDB.conf file for this information.
         * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
         * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **MongoDB/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
         * **Fields**. Set the following fields:
           * `component = database`
           * `db_system = mongodb`
           * `db_cluster = <Your_MongoDB_Cluster_Name>`
           * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod
					 * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
					 * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “mongodb-prod.sumologic.com:3306” as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given MongoDB node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the `“host”` field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “MongoDB address” Entities
:::
      3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
         * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
         * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your MongoDB Server’s time zone.
         * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
         * **Encoding** Select UTF-8 (Default).
         * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
         * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
      4. Click **Save**.
   2. To add a Syslog Source source for MongoDB, do the following:
      1. Add a [Syslog source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Syslog-Source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
      2. Configure the Syslog Source fields as follows:
         * **Name.** (Required)
         * **Description.** (Optional)
         * **Protocol**: UDP
         * **Port**: 514 (as entered while configuring logging in Step b.)
         * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **MongoDB/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
         * **Fields. **Set the following fields:
           * `component = database`
           * `db_system = MongoDB`
           * `db_cluster = <Your_MongoDB_Cluster_Name>`
           * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod
					 * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
					 * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “mongodb-prod.sumologic.com:3306” as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given MongoDB node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=mongodb-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “MongoDB address” Entities.
:::
      3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
         * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
         * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your MongoDB Server’s time zone.
         * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
           * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
      4. Click **Save**.

At this point, MongoDB logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

## Installing MongoDB Monitors

The next few sections have instructions for installing Sumo Logic Monitors for MongoDB, the app, and descriptions of each of the app dashboards. These instructions assume you have already set up collection as described in the [Collect Logs and Metrics for MongoDB](#Collect-Logs-for-MongoDB) App page.

Sumo Logic has provided pre-packaged alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you proactively determine if a MongoDB cluster is available and performing as expected. These monitors are based on metric and log data and include pre-set thresholds that reflect industry best practices and recommendations. For more information about individual alerts, see [MongoDB Alerts](#MongoDB-Alerts).

To install these monitors, you must have the **Manage Monitors** role capability.

You can install monitors by importing a JSON file or using a Terraform script.

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors#Rules) for details.

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/MongoDB/MongoDB.json) that describes the monitors.
2. Replace `$$mongodb_data_source` with a custom source filter. To configure alerts for a specific database cluster, use a filter like `db_system=mongodb` or `db_cluster=dev-mongodb`. To configure the alerts for all of your clusters, set `$$mongodb_data_source` to blank (`""`).
3. Go to **Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors**.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Click **Import**.
6. On the **Import Content popup**, enter `MongoDB` in the Name field, paste in the JSON into the the popup, and click **Import**.  
7. The monitors are created in a "MongoDB" folder. The monitors are disabled by default. See the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) topic for information about enabling monitors and configuring notifications or connections.


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID for a user that has the **Manage Monitors** role capability. For instructions see  [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key_on_Preferences_page).
2. Download [Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later, and install it.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for MongoDB monitors. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic github [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/MongoDB). You can either download it using the `git clone` command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration. After extracting the package , navigate to the  `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/MongoDB/` directory. Edit the `MongoDB.auto.tfvars` file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key and Access ID from Step 1 and your Sumo Logic deployment. If you're not sure of your deployment, see [Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
  ```bash
  access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
  access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
  environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
  ```

  The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the `mongodb_data_source` variable. For example:
	 * To configure alerts for A specific cluster set `mongodb_data_source` to something like `db_cluster = mongodb.prod.01`
	 * To configure alerts for All clusters in an environment set `mongodb_data_source` to something like `environment = prod`
	 * To configure alerts for Multiple clusters using a wildcard set `mongodb_data_source` to something like `db_cluster = mongodb-prod*`
	 * To configure alerts for A specific cluster within a specific environment, set `mongodb_data_source` to something like `db_cluster = mongodb-1` and `environment = prod`. This assumes you have configured and applied Fields as described in [Step 1: Configure Sumo Logic Fields](#step-1-configure-fields-in-sumo-logic).

  All monitors are disabled by default on installation. To enable all of the monitors, set the `monitors_disabled` parameter to `false`. By default, the monitors will be located in a "MongoDB" folder on the **Monitors** page. To change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in the `folder` variable in the `MongoDB.auto.tfvars` file.

5. If you want the alerts to send email or connection notifications, edit the `MongoDB_notifications.auto.tfvars` file to populate the `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` sections. Examples are provided below. In the variable definition below, replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection ID of the Webhook connection. You can obtain the Webhook connection ID by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).
```bash title="Pagerduty connection example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

For information about overriding the payload for different connection types, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/manage/connections-integrations/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections.md).

```bash title="Email notifications example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

6. Install Monitors
   1. Navigate to the `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/MongoDB/` directory and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and download the required components.
   2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors that Terraform will create or modify.
   3. Run `terraform apply`.


## Installing the MongoDB App

Now that you have set up collection for MongoDB, install the Sumo Logic App for MongoDB to use the preconfigured searches and [dashboards](#viewing-dashboards) to analyze your data.

Locate and install the app you need from the App Catalog. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click Preview Dashboards.

1. From the App Catalog, search for and select the app.
1. Select the service version you're using and click Add to Library. Version selection applies only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the Install the Apps from the Library.
1. To install the app, complete the following fields.
   * App Name. You can retain the existing name or enter the app's name of your choice. 
   * Advanced. Select the Location in the Library (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click New Folder to add a new folder.
1. Click Add to Library.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your Personal folder or another folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## Viewing MongoDB Dashboards

If no events have occurred within the time range of the Panel, the Panel will be empty.
