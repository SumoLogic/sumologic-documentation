The [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/intro.htm#CNCPT001) app is a logs based app. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide insight into the listeners, sys/xml audit logs, alerts, performance, and security.

This app is tested with the following Oracle versions:

- Non-Kubernetes: Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production - Version 19.3.0.0.0

Oracle logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Oracle-OpenTelemetry/Oracle-Schematics.png' alt="Schematics" />

## Log types

- Alert Logs
- Listener Logs
- Audit Logs

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for Oracle

Following are the tags which that be created as part of Oracle App install if not already present. 

- `db.cluster.name`. User configured. Enter a name to identify this Oracle cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
- `db.system`. Has a fixed value of **oracle**.
- `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **oracle**.

## Prerequisites

Here are the steps required to configure log collection for Oracle running on a non-Kubernetes environment.

* [Enable Oracle logging](#enable-oracle-logging)
* [Verify log files path](#verify-local-logs-file-directories-and-path)
* [Set up Oracle performance metrics script](#performance-metrics-script-setup)
* [Configure three local log file Sources](#step-2-configure-integration)

### Enable Oracle logging

If logging is not enabled, you can configure it by following the steps below.

- **Alert log**. Alert logs contain important information about error messages and exceptions that occur during database operations.
- **Listener log**. To enable listener log, run the following commands from `ORACLE_HOME/bin`:
   ```sh
   lsnrctl command  [listener_name]
   lsnrctl set log_status on
   ```
- **Audit Log**. Follow [this](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10575/tdpsg_auditing.htm#TDPSG50000) guide to enable Audit Logs.

### Verify local logs file directories and path

- **Oracle Alert Logs**. For 11g and later releases (12c, 18c, 19c). By default, Oracle logs are stored in
`$ORACLE_BASE/diag/rdbms/$DB_UNIQUE_NAME/$ORACLE_SID/trace/`. The default directory for log files is stored in `BACKGROUND_DUMP_DEST` parameter. You can query the value of `BACKGROUND_DUMP_DEST`, an initialization parameter, where you can find Oracle alert log by executing the command below:
  ```sh
  SQL > show parameter background_dump_dest;
  ```
- **Oracle Listener Logs**. You can check listener log file with the following command:
  ```
  [oracle@sumolab alert]$ lsnrctl status
  ```
- **Oracle Audit Logs**. By default, Oracle logs are stored in
  ```
  $ORACLE_BASE/app/oracle/admin/orcl/adump
  ```

The default directory for log files is stored as the value of `audit_file_dest`. In order to display it, run the following command: `SQL> show parameter audit`.

Audit Logs should be in either `XML`, `EXTENDED`, or `{{OS }}` format for the app to work.

The location of these logs will be required when you set up the app through the app catalog.

### Performance Metrics Script Setup

To set up the performance metrics script on Linux and Windows for the Oracle app:

1. Follow [these instructions](/docs/integrations/databases/oracle/#performance-metrics-script-setup) for your operating system. You don't need to configure the Sumo Logic Script Source at this time.
2. As per the above instructions, once the python script is available locally, you need to trigger this script periodically by copying the [cronJob.py](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-solution-templates/blob/master/application-data-collection/Utils/cronJob.py) file. This will generate an output log file, path for which needs to be given at the time of app installation. Based on your platform please follow the steps below:

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'} 
    ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">
  Configure a cron job to trigger the python script using crontab. Frequency of this job can be set following the instructions from [here](https://www.python-engineer.com/posts/cron-jobs-for-python/#crontab).

  * To find the python3 path, you can run: 

    ```sh
    which python3
    ```
  * Here is the command which needs to be configured as part of cron to trigger the script:

    ```sh
    <frequency_expression> <output_of_which_python3> <path_to_cronJob.py> <path_to_oracle-perf-monitor.py> <timeout_in_seconds> <output_location_of_file>
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows">

  * Find the location of python.exe by running:
    ```
    where python3
    ```
  * Create a `.bat` file with the following arguments:
    ```sh
    @ECHO OFF
    <output_of_where_python3> <path_to_cronJob.py> <path_to_oracle-perf-monitor.py> <timeout_in_seconds> <output_location_of_file>
    ```

  The `.bat` file created above can then be triggered periodically using windows Task Scheduler following an example [here](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-schedule-batch-file-run-automatically-windows-7).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

<LogsCollectionPrereqisites/>

For Windows systems, log files which are collected should be accessible by the SYSTEM group. Use the following set of PowerShell commands if the SYSTEM group does not have access.

```
$NewAcl = Get-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>"
# Set properties
$identity = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
$fileSystemRights = "ReadAndExecute"
$type = "Allow"
# Create new rule
$fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList = $identity, $fileSystemRights, $type
$fileSystemAccessRule = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule -ArgumentList $fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList
# Apply new rule
$NewAcl.SetAccessRule($fileSystemAccessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" -AclObject $NewAcl
```

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up the Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Oracle-OpenTelemetry/Oracle-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Oracle Collection.

Path of the log file configured to capture oracle logs needs to be given here. Here is the list of logs which are required by the application. 

- Alert Logs
- Listener Logs
- Audit Logs
- Performance metric script-based logs

You can get the location of these logs by following the instructions in the prerequisite step.

Once the details are filled, click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.
