[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/about/) is an in-memory data structure that implements a distributed, in-memory key-value database with durability options.

The Sumo Logic app for Redis helps you monitor the Redis database cluster. The preconfigured dashboards provide detailed analysis based on logs and metrics. The panels provide details such as RDBMemory Usage, events, RDB, AOF events, resource usage, commands running, and cache hit rate.

Redis logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver). The OpenTelemetry collector runs on the same host as Redis and uses the [Redis Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/redisreceiver) and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic.

## Log and metrics types

This app supports metrics and logs for Redis in Cluster mode or Standalone mode. The Redis logs are generated in files as configured in the cluster node configuration files in `/etc/redis/redis.conf`. For more details on Redis logs, see [Redis documentation](https://redislabs.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-5-using-redis-for-application-support/5-1-logging-to-redis/).

The app supports metrics generated by the [Redis Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/redisreceiver/documentation.md).

## Creating fields in Sumo Logic for Redis

The following are [fields](/docs/manage/fields/) that will be created as part of the Redis App install if not already present.

* **`db.cluster.name`**. User configured. Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* **`db.system`**. Has fixed value of redis.
* **`deployment.environment`**. User configured. This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster resides. For example: dev, prod or qa.
* **`db.node.name`**. Has the value of host name of the machine which is being monitored.
* **`sumo.datasource`**. Has fixed value of redis.

## Prerequisites

### For metrics collection

The Redis INFO command returns information and statistics about a Redis server (see Redis [INFO](https://redis.io/commands/info) for details). The Redis receiver extracts values from the result and converts them to OpenTelemetry metrics.

### For logs collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Redis running on a non-Kubernetes environment. By default, Redis logs are stored in a log file.

Follow the instructions to set up log collection:

1. To configure the Redis log file, locate your local [`redis.conf`](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf) configuration file in the database directory. By default, Redis logs are stored in `/var/log/redis/redis-server.log`.
1. After determining the location of conf file, open your `redis.conf` configuration file in a text editor to modify its logging parameters as such:
   1. Specify the server verbosity level. The value **`loglevel`** in conf file can be set to one of the following, in ascending order of severity: `debug`, `verbose`, `notice`, `warning`.
   1. Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force Redis to log on the standard output. If you use the standard output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to `/dev/null` logfile.
1. Save the `redis.conf` file and restart the Redis server using the command: `sudo service redis-server restart`.

Once the logs are configured to write to a local file, follow the steps below to configure the collection in Sumo Logic.

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

### Step 2: Configure integration

OpenTelemetry works with a [configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) yaml file with all the details concerning the data that needs to be collected. For example, it specifies the location of a log file that is read and sent to the Sumo Logic platform.

In this step, you will configure the yaml file required for Redis Collection.

Below are the inputs required:

- **`endpoint (no default)`**. The hostname and port of the Redis instance, separated by a colon. (For example: `localhost:6379`.)
- **Redis logs Path**. Enter the path to the log file for your Redis instance.

The log file path configured to capture redis logs must be given here. The files are typically located in `/var/log/redis/redis-server.log`. If you are using a customized path, check the [`redis.conf`](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf) file for this information.

You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

:::note
  Each Redis replica requires an independent Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry collector to be installed for effective logs and metrics monitoring.

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Copy the yaml at `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Redis instance that needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the otelcol-sumo process using:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart otelcol-sumo
  ```
