Redis is an in-memory data structure implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability.

The Sumo Logic app for Redis helps you monitor the state of the database cluster. The preconfigured dashboards provide information about cluster status, resource usage, commands running, and cache hit rate. You can easily determine the health of the cluster by just a glance at the dashboards.


## Log and Metrics types

This Sumo Logic app for Redis supports Metrics and Logs for Redis in Cluster or Standalone mode. The Redis logs are generated in files as configured in the cluster node configuration files in /etc/redis/redis.conf. For more details on Redis logs, [click here](https://redislabs.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-5-using-redis-for-application-support/5-1-logging-to-redis/).

The app supports metrics generated by the [Redis plugin for Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) and assumes prometheus format metrics.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Redis

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Redis. Configuring log and metric collection for the Redis ULM app includes the following tasks:

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).

:::note
This step is not needed if you are using the application components solution terraform script.
:::  

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using Redis in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_db_system`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster_address`
* `pod_labels_db_cluster_port`


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using Redis in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
* `component`
* `environment`
* `db_system`
* `db_cluster`
* `db_cluster_address`
* `db_cluster_port`


</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Configure Collection for Redis

Sumo Logic supports collection of logs and metrics data from Redis in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Click on the appropriate tab below based on the environment where your Redis clusters are hosted.

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture).The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Redis in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/databases/redis-flow.png')} alt="redis-flow" />

The first service in the metrics pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Redis. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment: that is, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Redis input plugin to obtain metrics. (For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.) The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

#### Configure Metrics Collection

:::note prerequisites
Ensure that you are monitoring your Kubernetes clusters with the Telegraf operator. If you are not, then follow [these instructions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to do so.
:::

1. To collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment, add the following annotations on your Redis pods:
  ```sql
   annotations:
      telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
      prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
      prometheus.io/port: "9273"
      telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
      servers = ["tcp://:<username-CHANGEME>:<password-CHANGEME>@localhost:6379"]
    [inputs.redis.tags]
      environment: "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      component="database"
      db_system="redis"
      db_cluster: "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
  ```
2. Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED` in the snippet above):
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs` - As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
     * In the input plugins section i.e.:
        * `servers` - The URL to the Redis server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Redis servers.
     * In the tags section, `[inputs.redis.tags]`:
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster identified by the value of **`servers`** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
        * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
        * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “redis-prod.sumologic.com:3306” as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=redis-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given redis node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: host=redis-prod.sumologic.com

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Redis address” Entities.
:::
   * **Do not modify the following values**, as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
      * `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
      * `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
      * `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
      * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
        * In the tags section, that is`[inputs.redis.tags]`
        * `component: "database"` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `db_system: "redis"` - This value identifies the database system.
   * See [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
   * For more information on configuring the Redis input plugin for Telegraf, see [this doc.](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis)
3. Once this has been done, the Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic by running the following metrics query:
  ```sql
  db_cluster=<Your_Redis_Cluster_Name> component="database" \
  and db_system="redis"
  ```

#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Redis logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **Collect Redis logs written to standard output**. If your Redis helm chart/pod is writing the logs to standard output, then follow the steps listed below.
   1. Apply the following labels to your Redis pods:
   ```sql
   environment: "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
   component: "database"
   db_system: "redis"    
   db_cluster: "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
   db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
   db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
   ```
   2. Enter in values for the following parameters (marked ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED above):
     * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
     * db_cluster_address - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
     * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for the net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “redis-prod.sumologic.com:3306” as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=redis-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given Redis node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=redis-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Redis address” Entities
:::
     * **Do not modify these values** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
       * `component: “database”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
       * `db_system: “redis”` - This value identifies the database system.
     * For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
   3. The Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection will automatically capture the logs from stdout and will send the logs to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, see [this page](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App).
2. Collect Redis logs written to log files (Optional). If your Redis helm chart/pod is writing its logs to log files, you can use a [sidecar](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator) to send log files to standard out. To do this:
   1. Determine the location of the Redis log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the redis.conf for your Redis cluster along with the mounts on the Redis pods.
   2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
   ```xml
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_redis_log_file>/<redis_log_file_name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/redis-master-data/redis.log
   ```
   4. Make sure that the Redis pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <redis_pod_name>
    ```
   5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
3. **Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**. This step is not needed if using application components solution terraform script. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule. To do so:
   * Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   * Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
   * The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear:
   * Enter the following options:
      * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Database**.
      * **Applied At**. Choose **Ingest Time**.
        * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**. Enter the following keyword search expression:
        ```sql
        pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=database pod_labels_db_system=* pod_labels_db_cluster=*
        ```
        * **Parse Expression**. Enter the following parse expression:
        ```sql
        | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
           | pod_labels_component as component
           | pod_labels_db_system as db_system
           | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_db_cluster), pod_labels_db_cluster, null) as db_cluster
        ```    
   * Click **Save*** to create the rule.

For Non-Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator for Redis metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Redis logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Redis collection in a non-Kubernetes environment. Telegraf runs on the same system as Redis, and uses the Redis input plugin to obtain Redis metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Redis on the other hand are sent to either a Sumo Logic Local File or Syslog source.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/databases/redis-nonk8.png')} alt="redis-nonk8s" />

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Redis. Follow the instructions below to set up metrics and logs collection for a given Redis cluster:

#### Configure Metrics Collection

1. Configure a Hosted Collector. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following[ these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. Install Telegraf. Follow the steps in [this document ](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md)Use the [in this document following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
4. Configure and start Telegraf. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Redis input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.  
   1. Create or modify the telegraf.conf file and copy and paste the text below:   
    ```sql
    [[inputs.redis]]
      servers = ["tcp://localhost:6379"]
      namepass = ["redis"]
      fieldpass = ["blocked_clients", "clients", "cluster_enabled", "cmdstat_calls", "connected_slaves", "evicted_keys", "expired_keys", "instantaneous_ops_per_sec", "keyspace_hitrate", "keyspace_hits", "keyspace_misses", "master_repl_offset", "maxmemory", "mem_fragmentation_bytes", "mem_fragmentation_ratio", "rdb_changes_since_last_save", "rejected_connections", "slave_repl_offset", "total_commands_processed", "total_net_input_bytes", "total_net_output_bytes", "tracking_total_keys", "uptime", "used_cpu_sys", "used_cpu_user", "used_memory", "used_memory_overhead", "used_memory_rss", "used_memory_startup"]
      [inputs.redis.tags]
      environment = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      component ="database"
      db_system ="redis"
      db_cluster: "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
    [[outputs.sumologic]]
      url = "<URL Created in Step 3>"
      data_format = "prometheus"
    ```
   2. Enter values for the following parameters (marked ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED above):
     * For the input plugins section:
        * `servers` - The URL to the Redis server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Redis servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Redis input plugin for Telegraf.
     * For tags section (`[inputs.redis.tags]`):
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `db_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
        * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
        * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
:::note
`db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

For example, if your application uses “`redis-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=redis-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

If your application connects directly to a given Redis node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=redis-prod.sumologic.com`

Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Redis address” Entities.
:::
     * For output plugins section:
        * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. See [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
     * **Do not modify these values**, as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
       * `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, for which Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic.
       * `db_system: “redis”` - In the input plugins section:  This value identifies the database system.
       * `component: “database”` - In the input plugins section: This value identifies application components.
     * See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally. Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from their [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Redis metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Redis Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Redis running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic app for Redis. By default, Redis logs are stored in a log file. Redis also supports forwarding of logs via Syslog.

Sumo Logic supports collecting logs both via Syslog and a local log file. Utilizing Sumo Logic [Cloud Syslog](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source) will require TCP TLS Port 6514 to be open in your network. Local log files can be collected via [Sumo Logic Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) which  requires you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work.

Follow the instructions to set up log collection:

1. **Configure logging in Redis**. Redis supports logging via following methods: syslog, local text log files and stdout. Redis logs have four levels of verbosity. All logging settings are located in [redis.conf](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf). To select a level, set `loglevel` to one of:
   * **debug** - This level produces a lot of information, which could be useful in development/testing environments)
   * **verbose** - This level includes information not often needed, but logs less than debug)
   * **notice** (moderately verbose, ideal for production environments) - this is the default value
   * **warning** (only very important / critical messages are logged)
2. **Configure Redis to log to a local file or syslog**. As part of this step, you will make a decision on how to export Redis logs and then accordingly configure your Redis cluster.

<details><summary>Option A: Configure Redis logs to go to log files</summary>

With this option, Redis logs written to a log file can be collected via the [Local File Source of a](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) Sumo Logic Installed collector.

To configure the Redis log file, locate your local **redis.conf** configuration file in the database directory. By default, Redis logs are stored in /var/log/redis/redis-server.log.

After determining the location of conf file modify the **redis.conf** configuration file logging parameters:
1. Open redis.conf configuration file in a text editor.
2. Set the following config parameters:
   * Specify the server verbosity level. This can be one of:
     * debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
      * verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
      * notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
      * warning (only very important / critical messages are logged) loglevel notice
   * Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null logfile `""`
3. Save the **redis.conf** file and restart the redis server:
  ```bash
  sudo service redis-server restart
  ```

</details>

<details><summary>Option B: Configure Redis logs to stream data to a Syslog source</summary>

With this option, Redis logs can be streamed to the [Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/syslog-source) of a Sumo Logic Installed Collector.

To configure the Redis syslog, locate your local **redis.conf** configuration file in the database directory.

After determining the location of conf file, modify the **redis.conf** configuration file logging parameters

1. Open redis.conf configuration file in a text editor.
2. Set the following config parameters:
   * To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes, and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.
   ```bash
   syslog-enabled no
   ```
   * Specify the syslog identity.
   ```bash
   syslog-ident redis
   ```
   * Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
   ```bash
   syslog-facility local0
   ```
3. Save the **redis.conf** file and restart the redis server:
   ```bash
   sudo service redis-server restart
   ```
4. At this point, Redis will start pushing the logs to the local syslog server.

</details>

3. **Configure an Installed Collector**. To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page [Configure an Installed Collector.](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors)
4. **Configure a Source**. To add a Local File Source source for Redis, do the following:
   1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
      * **Name.** (Required)
      * **Description.** (Optional)
      * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in /var/log/redis/redis-server.log. If you're using a customized path, check the redis.conf file for this information.
      * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
      * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Redis/Logs**. The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).
   3. Fields. Set the following fields. For more information on fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md):
      * `component = database`
      * `db_system = redis`
      * `db_cluster = <Your_Redis_Cluster_Name>`
      * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod.
      * `db_cluster_address` - Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
      * `db_cluster_port` - Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.
      :::note
      `db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).
      For example, if your application uses `“redis-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=redis-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`.
      If your application connects directly to a given Redis node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=redis-prod.sumologic.com`

      Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “Redis address” Entities.

## Installing Redis Monitors/Alerts

:::note
This step is not needed if you are using the application components solution terraform script.
:::  

This section has instructions for installing the Sumo app and Alerts for Redis ULM, as well as descriptions and examples for each of the dashboards. These instructions assume you have already set up collection as described in the **Collecting Logs and Metrics for Redis app** section.

Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerting capabilities available via [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you quickly determine if the Redis database cluster is available and performing as expected. These monitors fire alerts (notifications) on top of preset thresholds on metrics data using industry best practices and recommendations.

For details on the individual monitors, please see [Alerts](#Redis-Alerts).

* To install these alerts, you need to have the Manage Monitors role capability.
* Alerts can be installed by either importing them via a JSON or via a Terraform script.

:::note
There are limits for how many alerts can be enabled - please see the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts/monitors/monitor-faq.md) for details.
:::  

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download a [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/redis) that describes the monitors. The JSON contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all Redis clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.,  However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `db_system=redis` with `<Your Custom Filter> db_system=redis`. Custom filter examples:
   * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be:  `db_cluster=redis-.prod.01`.
   * For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with `redis-prod`, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=redis-prod*`.
   * For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.
2. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
3. Click **Add**:
4. Click Import to import monitors from the JSON above.

:::note
Monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts via this method, navigate to the Redis folder under **Monitors** to configure them. See [this](/docs/alerts/monitors#Disable_and_enable_a_monitor) document to enable monitors. To send notifications to teams or connections please see the instructions detailed in Step 4 of[ this document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).
:::

### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID for a user that has the Manage Monitors role capability in Sumo Logic using[ these](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#manage-your-access-keys-on-preferences-page) instructions. Please identify which deployment your Sumo Logic account is in,[ using](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) this link.
2. [Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Redis alerts. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic github[ repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/redis). You can either download it via the “git clone” command or as a zip file.
4. Monitor Configuration. After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**redis**/

Edit the redis.auto.tfvars file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id and Deployment from Step 1.
```bash
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```
The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the variable `redis_cluster_filter`. Custom filter examples:
   * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be:  `db_cluster=redis-.prod.01`.
   * For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with redis-prod, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=redis-prod*`.
   * For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.

All monitors are disabled by default on installation, if you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter `monitors_disabled` to `false` in this file.

By default, the monitors are configured in a monitor folder called “Redis”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in this file.

If you would like the alerts to send email or connection notifications, configure these in the file **redis_notifications.auto.tfvars**. For configuration examples, refer to the next section.

5. Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples. To configure notifications, modify the file redis_notifications.auto.tfvars file and fill in the connection_notifications See the examples for PagerDuty and email notifications below. See [this document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections) for creating payloads with other connection types.
```bash title="Pagerduty Connection Example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

Replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved via calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

For overriding payload for different connection types, refer to [this document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).

```bash title="Email Notifications Example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

6. Install the Monitors.
   1. Navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**redis**/ and run **terraform init. **This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
   2. Run **terraform plan **to view the monitors which will be created/modified by Terraform.
   3. Run **terraform apply**.

7. Post Installation. If you haven’t enabled alerts and/or configured notifications via the Terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other people or services. This is detailed in [Add a Monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).


## Installing the Redis app

This section demonstrates how to install the Redis ULM app.

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the[ Install the Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
   1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
   2. **Data Source.**  Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter** and enter a custom Redis cluster filter. Examples:
     * For all Redis clusters: `db_cluster=*`
     * For a specific cluster: `db_cluster=redis.dev.01`. 
     * Clusters within a specific environment: `db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod`. (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)
   3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

## Viewing Redis dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).
