Redis is an in-memory data structure implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability.

The Sumo Logic App for Redis helps you monitor the state of the database cluster. The preconfigured dashboards provide information about cluster status, resource usage, commands running, and cache hit rate. You can easily determine the health of the cluster by just a glance at the dashboards.


#### Log and Metrics Types

App support Metrics and Logs for Redis in Cluster or Standalone mode.

The Redis logs are generated in files as configured in the cluster node configuration files in /etc/redis/redis.conf. For more details on Redis logs, see [this](https://redislabs.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-5-using-redis-for-application-support/5-1-logging-to-redis/) link.

The Sumo Logic App for Redis supports metrics generated by the [Redis plugin for Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis). The app assumes prometheus format Metrics.


## Collect Logs and Metrics for Redis

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic App for Redis.


### Collection Process Overview

Configuring log and metric collection for the Redis ULM App includes the following tasks:

* Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic.
* Step 2: Configure Collection for Redis
    * [Collect Redis Logs and Metrics for Non-Kubernetes environments](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/12Databases/Redis/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Redis/Collect_Redis_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Non-Kubernetes_environments).

##### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic
4


Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see the [Fields](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Fields) help page.

If you are using Redis in a  non-Kubernetes environment create the fields:



* component
* environment
* db_system
* db_cluster
* pod

If you are using Redis in a Kubernetes environment create the fields:



* pod_labels_component
* pod_labels_environment
* pod_labels_db_system
* pod_labels_db_cluster


##### Step 2: Configure Collection for Redis
5


Sumo Logic supports collection of logs and metrics data from Redis in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.

Please click on the appropriate links below based on the environment where your Redis clusters are hosted.

## Collect Redis Logs and Metrics for Kubernetes environments

In a Kubernetes environment, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it[ here](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Collect_Metrics_Using_Telegraf/01_Telegraf_Collection_Architecture).The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Redis in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Prometheus, Fluentd and FluentBit.

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Redis. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment: i.e. Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Redis input plugin to obtain metrics. (For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.) The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator. We also have Fluentbit that collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to FluentD, which in turn sends all the logs and metrics data to a Sumo Logic HTTP Source.


12


Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection:



1. Configure Metrics Collection
    1. Setup Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf operator
    2. Add annotations on your Redis pods
2. Configure Logs Collection
    3. Configure logging in Redis.
    4. Add labels on your Redis pods to capture logs from standard output.
    5. Collecting Redis Logs from a Log file.


##### Prerequisites
13


Please ensure that you are monitoring your Kubernetes clusters with the Telegraf operator - If you are not, then please follow [these instructions](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Collect_Metrics_Using_Telegraf/03_Install_Telegraf#Install_Telegraf_in_a_Kubernetes_environment) to do so.


###### Step 1 Configure Metrics Collection
14


Follow the steps to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment:

**Add annotations on your Redis pods**

On your Redis Pods, add the following annotations:


```
 annotations:
    telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9273"
    telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+


        servers = ["tcp://:<username-CHANGME>:<password-CHANGEME>@localhost:6379"]
        [inputs.redis.tags]
        environment="prod"
        component="database"
        db_system="redis"
        db_cluster="redis_prod_cluster01-CHANGEME"
```


Please enter in values for the following parameters (marked in bold above):



* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs` - As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
    * In the input plugins section i.e. :
        * servers - The URL to the Redis server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Redis servers.
    * In the tags section i.e.  `[inputs.redis.tags]`
        * environment - This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * db_cluster - Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **please do not modify** these values as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.



* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section, that is`[inputs.redis.tags]`
        * `component: "database"` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `db_system: "redis"` - This value identifies the database system.

For more information on all other parameters please see [this doc](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Collect_Metrics_Using_Telegraf/03_Install_Telegraf#Configuring_Telegraf) for more properties that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

For more information on configuring the Redis input plugin for Telegraf please see [this doc.](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis)



1. Once this has been done, the Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
2. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic by running the following metrics query: \
`db_cluster=<Your_Redis_Cluster_Name> component="database"` and `db_system="redis"`


###### Step 2 Configure Logs Collection
15


This section explains the steps to collect Redis logs from a Kubernetes environment.



1. Collect Redis logs written to standard output: \
If your Redis helm chart/pod is writing the logs to standard output then follow the steps listed below to collect the logs:

Apply the following labels to yourthe Redis pods: \
labels: \
<code>    environment: "prod"</code>


```
    component: "database"
    db_system: "redis"

```



    1. `db_cluster: "redis_prod_cluster01"` \

Please enter in values for the following parameters (marked in bold above):
* environment - This is the deployment environment where the Redis cluster identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
* db_cluster - Enter a name to identify this Redis cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards. \
 \
Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you please do not modify as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
* component: “database” - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* db_system: “redis” - This value identifies the database system. \
 \
For all other parameters please see [this doc](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Collect_Metrics_Using_Telegraf/03_Install_Telegraf#Configuring_Telegraf) for more properties that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

The Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection will automatically capture the logs from stdout and will send the logs to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection,[ ](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/10Containers_and_Orchestration/Kubernetes/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App) please see[ this page](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/10Containers_and_Orchestration/Kubernetes/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App).

2. Collect Redis logs written to log files (Optional)

If your Redis helm chart/pod is writing its logs to log files, you can use a [sidecar](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator) to send log files to standard out. To do this:



1. Determine the location of the Redis log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the redis.conf for your Redis cluster along with the mounts on the Redis pods.
2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.


```
annotations:
  tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_redis_log_file>/<redis_log_file_name>
```



    Example:


```
annotations:
  tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/redis-master-data/redis.log
```



    4. Make sure that the Redis pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command: **kubectl describe pod <redis_pod_name>**


    5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.

3. Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments

Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule. To do so:



1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
3. The following form appears:

    Table of contents


We use the Telegraf Operator for Redis metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Redis logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Redis collection in a non-Kubernetes environment. Telegraf runs on the same system as Redis, and uses the Redis input plugin to obtain Redis metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Redis on the other hand are sent to either a Sumo Logic Local File or Syslog source.

Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from their [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Redis metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.


##### Step 2 Configure Collection of Redis Logs
18


This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Redis running on a non-Kkubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for Redis.

By default, Redis logs are stored in a log file. Redis also supports forwarding of logs via Syslog.

Sumo Logic supports collecting logs both via Syslog and a local log file. Utilizing Sumo Logic [Cloud Syslog](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/Cloud-Syslog-Source) will require TCP TLS Port 6514 to be open in your network. Local log files can be collected via [Sumo Logic Installed collectors](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Installed-Collectors) which  requires you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/General-API-Information/Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-by-Deployment-and-Firewall-Security) for collection to work.

Follow the instructions below to set up log collection:



1. Configure logging in Redis
2. Configure local log file or syslog collection
3. Configure an Installed Collector
4. Configure a SourceConfigure logging in Redis




###### **Step 1: Configure logging in Redis **
19


Redis supports logging via following methods: syslog, local text log files and stdout. Redis logs have four levels of verbosity. To select a level, set loglevel to one of:



* debug - This level produces a lot of information, which could be useful in development/testing environments)
* verbose - This level includes information not often needed, but logs less than debug)
* notice (moderately verbose, ideal for production environments) - this is the **default value**
* warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)

All logging settings are located in [redis.conf](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf).




###### **Step 2: Configure Redis to log to a local file or syslog **
20


As part of this step, you will make a decision on how to export Redis logs and then accordingly configure your Redis cluster.

**Option 1: Configuring Redis logs to go to log files**

With this option, Redis logs written to a log file can be collected via the [Local File Source of a ](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Local-File-Source)Sumo Logic Installed collector**.**

**To configure the Redis log file, locate** your local **redis.con**f configuration file in the database directory. By default, Redis logs are stored in /var/log/redis/redis-server.log.

After determining the location of conf file modify the **redis.conf** configuration file logging parameters



1. Open redis.conf configuration file in a text editor.
2. Set the following config parameters: \
# Specify the server verbosity level. \
# This can be one of: \
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing) \
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level) \
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably) \
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged) \
loglevel notice \
 \
# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force \
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard \
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null \
logfile ""
3. Save the **redis.conf** file and restart the redis server: \
sudo service redis-server restart

**Option 2: Configuring Redis logs to stream data to a Syslog source**

With this option, Redis logs can be streamed to the [Syslog Source](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Syslog-Source) of a Sumo Logic Installed Collector.

**To configure the Redis syslog, locate** your local **redis.con**f configuration file in the database directory.

After determining the location of conf file, modify the **redis.conf** configuration file logging parameters



1. Open redis.conf configuration file in a text editor.
2. Set the following config parameters: \
# To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes, \
# and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs. \
# syslog-enabled no \
 \
# Specify the syslog identity. \
# syslog-ident redis \
 \
# Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7. \
# syslog-facility local0
3. Save the **redis.conf** file and restart the redis server: \
sudo service redis-server restart
4. At this point, Redis will start pushing the logs to the local syslog server.




###### **Step 3: Configuring an Installed Collector **
21


To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page [Configure an Installed Collector.](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Installed-Collectors)




###### **Step 4: Configuring a Source **
22


**To add a Local File Source source for Redis do the following**



1. Add a[ Local File Source](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Local-File-Source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
* **Name.** (Required)
* **Description.** (Optional)
* **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in /var/log/redis/redis-server.log. If you are using a customized path, check the redis.conf file for this information.
* **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
* **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Redis/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see[ Best Practices](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/01-Design-Your-Deployment/Best-Practices%3A-Good-Source-Category%2C-Bad-Source-Category).)
* **Fields. Set the following fields. For more information on fields please see [this document](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Fields):**
    1. **component = database**
    2. **db_system = redis**
    3. **db_cluster = <Your_Redis_Cluster_Name>**
    4. **environment = <Environment_Name>, such as Dev, QA or Prod. \
**
23


3. Configure the **Advanced** section:



* **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
* **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your Redis Server’s time zone.
* **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
* **Encoding. **Select** **UTF-8 (Default).
* **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
    * Select Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically

4. Click **Save**.

24




1. Enter the following options:
* **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Database**.
* **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
* **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
    * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression: \
pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=database pod_labels_db_system=* pod_labels_db_cluster=*

**Parse Expression**.Enter the following parse expression: \

The JSON contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all Redis clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.,  However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text ‘**db_system=redis’ **with ‘**<Your Custom Filter> db_system=redis**’. \
 \
Custom filter examples:
        1. For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be:  **‘db_cluster=redis-.prod.01’.**
        2. For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with redis-prod, your custom filter would be: ‘db_cluster=redis-prod*’.
        3. For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be: db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection).
2. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
3. Click **Add**:

1. Click Import to import monitors from the JSON above.

**Note**: The monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts via this method, navigate to the Redis folder under **Monitors** to configure them. See [this](https://help.sumologic.com/Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Monitors#Disable_and_enable_a_monitor) document to enable monitors. To send notifications to teams or connections please see the instructions detailed in Step 4 of[ this document](https://help.sumologic.com/Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Monitors#Add_a_monitor).


###### **Method 2: Install the Monitors via a Terraform script**
30


**Step 1: Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID**

Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the Manage Monitors role capability in Sumo Logic using[ these](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access-Keys#manage-your-access-keys-on-preferences-page)_ _instructions. Please identify which deployment your Sumo Logic account is in,[ using](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/General-API-Information/Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-by-Deployment-and-Firewall-Security) this link.

**Step 2:[ Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later **

**Step 3: Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Redis alerts**

The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic github[ repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/redis). You can either download it via the “git clone” command or as a zip file.

**Step 4: Monitor Configuration **

After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**redis**/

Edit the redis.auto.tfvars file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id and Deployment from Step 1 .
```
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```
The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the variable `redis_cluster_filter`. Custom filter examples:



1. For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be:  **‘db_cluster=redis-.prod.01’**
2. For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with redis-prod, your custom filter would be: **‘db_cluster=redis-prod*’**
3. For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be: **db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod **(This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)

All monitors are disabled by default on installation, if you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter **monitors_disabled** to false in this file.

By default, the monitors are configured in a monitor folder called “Redis”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in this file.

If you would like the alerts to send email or connection notifications, configure these in the file **redis_notifications.auto.tfvars**. For configuration examples, refer to the next section.

**Step 5: Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples**

To configure notifications, modify the file redis_notifications.auto.tfvars file and fill in the connection_notifications See the examples for PagerDuty and email notifications below. See [this document](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Connections-and-Integrations/Webhook-Connections/Set_Up_Webhook_Connections) for creating payloads with other connection types.




###### **Pagerduty Connection Example: **
31



```
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```


Replace <CONNECTION_ID> with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved via calling the[ Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

For overriding payload for different connection types, refer to this[ document](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Connections-and-Integrations/Webhook-Connections/Set_Up_Webhook_Connections).




###### **Email Notifications Example: **
32



```
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```


**Step 6: Install the Moniotrs**



1. Navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**redis**/ and run **terraform init. **This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
2. Run **terraform plan **to view the monitors which will be created/modified by Terraform.
3. Run **terraform apply**.

**Step 7: Post Installation**

If you haven’t enabled alerts and/or configured notifications via the Terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other people or services. This is detailed in Step 4 of[ this document](https://help.sumologic.com/Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Monitors#Add_a_monitor).


#### Install the App
33


This section demonstrates how to install the Redis ULM App.


###### **To install the app:**
34


Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.



1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.


35
Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the[ Install the Apps from the Library](https://help.sumologic.com/01Start-Here/Library/Apps-in-Sumo-Logic/Install-Apps-from-the-Library).



1. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom Redis cluster filter. Examples:
        1. For all Redis clusters \
db_cluster=*
        2. For a specific cluster: \
(db_cluster=redis.dev.01). 
        3. Clusters within a specific environment: \
db_cluster=redis-1 and environment=prod  \
(This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)
2. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
1. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


#### Dashboard Filter with Template Variables   
36


Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you can view dynamic changes to the data for a fast resolution to the root cause.
