This section provides instructions for installing the Oracle Monitors, App, as well as examples of each of the App dashboards. These instructions assume you have already set up the collection as described in the Collect Logs and Metrics for the Oracle App page.


### Pre-Packaged Alerts

Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you monitor your Oracle clusters. These alerts are built based on metrics and logs datasets and include preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations.

For details on the individual alerts, see [this page](/docs/integrations/databases/oracle/alerts.md).


## Installing Monitors

* To install these alerts, you need to have the Manage Monitors role capability.
* Alerts can be installed by either importing a JSON file or a Terraform script.

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled - see the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts/monitors/monitor-faq.md) for details.


### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/Oracle/Oracle.json) that describes the monitors.
2. The [JSON](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/Oracle/Oracle.json) contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all Oracle clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.  However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `db_system=oracle` with `<Your Custom Filter>`.

Custom filter examples:

1. For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be, ‘`db_cluster=oracle-prod.01`‘.
2. For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with Kafka-prod, your custom filter would be,`db_cluster=oracle-prod*`.
3. **For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `db_cluster=oracle-1`** and `environment=prod` (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection).
4. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
5. Click **Add**: \

6. Click Import and then copy-paste the above JSON to import monitors.

The monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts using this method, navigate to the Oracle folder under **Monitors** to configure them. See [this](/docs/alerts/monitors) document to enable monitors to send notifications to teams or connections. See the instructions detailed in Step 4 of this [document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. **Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID.**
Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the Manage Monitors role capability in Sumo Logic using these[ instructions](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#manage-your-access-keys-on-preferences-page). Identify which deployment your Sumo Logic account is in, using this [link](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
2. **[Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later. **
3. **Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Oracle alerts.
**The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/Oracle). You can either download it through the “git clone” command or as a zip file.
4. **Alert Configuration .
**After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory **terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/Oracle/**

Edit the **Oracle.auto.tfvars** file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id and Deployment from Step 1.

```bash
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```


The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the variable **’oracle_data_source’**. Custom filter examples:

1. A specific cluster **‘`db_cluster=oracle.prod.01`’.
2. All clusters in an environment ‘`environment=prod`’.
3. For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with oracle-prod, your custom filter would be: ‘`db_cluster=qracle-prod*`’.
4. For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be,  \
`db_cluster=oracle-1` and `environment=prod` (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection).

All monitors are disabled by default on installation, if you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter monitors_disabled to false in this file.

By default, the monitors are configured in a monitor **folder** called “**Oracle**”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in “folder” key at **`Oracle.auto.tfvars` file.

If you would like the alerts to send email or connection notifications, configure these in the file **`Oracle_notifications.auto.tfvars`. For configuration examples, refer to the next section.

1. **Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples \
**Modify the file **Oracle_notifications.auto.tfvars** and populate connection_notifications and email_notifications as per below examples.

```bash title="Pagerduty Connection Example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```



Replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).


    For overriding payload for different connection types, refer to this [document](/docs/manage/connections-integrations/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections.md).


```bash title="Email Notifications Example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```


1. **Install the Alerts.**
    1. Navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**Oracle**/ and run **terraform init. **This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
    2. Run **terraform plan **to view the monitors which will be created/modified by Terraform.
    3. Run **terraform apply**.



1. **Post Installation.**
If you haven’t enabled alerts and/or configured notifications through the Terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other users or services. This is detailed in Step 4 of [this document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled - see the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts/monitors/monitor-faq.md).


## Installing the Oracle App

This section demonstrates how to install the Oracle App.

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the App Catalog, search for and select the app.
1. Select the service version you're using and click Add to Library. Version selection applies only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the Install the Apps from the Library.
1. To install the app, complete the following fields.
   * App Name. You can retain the existing name or enter the app's name of your choice. 
   * Advanced. Select the Location in the Library (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click New Folder to add a new folder.
1. Click Add to Library.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specify. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## Viewing Oracle Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables  

Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards-new/filter-template-variables.md).
