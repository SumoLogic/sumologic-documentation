[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is an open source automation server that provides a simple way to set up a continuous integration or delivery environment for building and testing software. The Sumo Logic App for Jenkins helps you monitor your build processes and Jenkins master and server health via pre-configured dashboards.

The Jenkins App allows you to monitor multiple Jenkins master nodes from a single-pane of glass. The app supports freestyle and pipeline jobs as well as pipeline, maven  and multi-branch pipeline projects.

Sumo Logic Jenkins plugin is compatible with Jenkins version 2.60.1 and above. For more information refer [Sumo Logic Jenkins Plugin WIKI](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sumologic-publisher) page.


## Log and Metric Types

All logs are JSON based, with the exception of job console logs. Graphite format metrics are generated.

The Jenkins App uses the following Log Types:
* Audit Logs - Log events related to user authentication, Jenkins system and job configuration changes and Jenkins job run events.
* Metric Data - Log events related to metric information of Jenkins Master.
* Periodic Logs - Log events related to Jenkins nodes, master shutdown events, jobs in progress and in queue.
* SCM Log - Log events related to Source Control Management systems like the github repository.
* Job Status Logs - Log events related to Jenkins jobs, test results and pipeline stages.
* Job Console Logs - Log events related to job console logs.

      ```
      2. Then, in the pipeline configuration, for declarative pipeline script update the option.
       ```js
       options {
         SumoPipelineLogCollection()
        }
       ```
3. Click **Apply**, and then click **Save**.



## Installing the Jenkins App

This section provides instructions for installing the Sumo Logic App for Jenkins, as well as examples and descriptions for each of the app dashboards.

Now that you have set up collection for Jenkins you can install the Sumo Logic App for Jenkins, and use its pre-configured searches and dashboards.

To install the app, do the following:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library.](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library)
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    * **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    *  **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`). 
    * **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## Viewing Jenkins Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards-new/filter-template-variables.md).
:::


### Overview Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Overview** dashboard shows relationships between jobs and executors (worker nodes) on a Jenkins master. This dashboard provides insights into job run durations, status, physical memory, disk memory, and unused machines.

Use this dashboard to:
* Correlate job builds with Jenkins executors (worker nodes), physical memory utilization, disk space utilization, console logs, the number of executors used by jobs, and the number of unused (free) worker nodes.
* Identify worker nodes not used by Jenkins master jobs to understand worker node usage.
* Analyze job health by filtering data for a specific job to identify the console log errors, system errors, number of executors used, disk space utilization, physical memory utilization.
* Identify Jenkins master shutdown events.
* Analyze the jobs in the queue with job queue duration, reason, job URL.
* Generate alerts based on shutdown events, job run duration, physical memory utilization, disk space utilization, and more.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-Overview.png')} alt="jenkins" />

### System Monitoring Dashboards

System Monitoring Dashboards provide information on system activities related to master node metrics, job metrics, worker nodes, and audit activities. System Monitoring dashboards help you to monitor changes related to the Jenkins configuration, job configuration, the health of the Jenkins master, performance of the job queue and run duration, as well as the health of all worker nodes available to the Jenkins master node.

#### Audit Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Audit** dashboard provides insight into user events, including configuration changes, authentication events, and job activities.

Use this dashboard to:

* Ensure only authorized users are accessing the Jenkins System and are modifying Jenkins system and job configurations
* Keep track of the job configuration changes
* Compare old and new Jenkins system and job configuration settings
* View trends for Jenkins job start and finish events

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-Audit.png')} alt="jenkins" />

#### Master Health Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Master Health** dashboard provides insight into the health of Jenkins master nodes with information on shutdown events, Jenkins system logs, and metrics events such as CPU, memory, job duration,  threads, and executors.

Executors are similar to threads that run jobs, so they are indicators of the load placed on Jenkins. If the executors are full, it means there are a lot of jobs running on the system and more executors may be needed to balance the load.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor shutdown events for Jenkins master nodes
* Monitor Jenkins system sogs to determine the root cause of system issues
* Monitor Jenkins master CPU usage and memory usage to allocate additional resources if needed
* Monitor free executors and busy executors on Jenkins master

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-MasterHealth.png')} alt="jenkins" />


#### Job Health Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Job Health** dashboard provides insight into the health of Jenkins jobs across various master nodes with information on job counts, job run duration, queue information, and garbage collection metrics.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor jobs in the queue, blocked and pending jobs to make sure your continuous integrations are running as expected
* Monitor garbage collection statistics  on the Jenkins master to understand how to improve performance and allocate additional resources if necessary

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-JobHealth.png')} alt="jenkins" />


#### Node Health Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Node Health** dashboard provides insights into the health of all Jenkins master and worker nodes, with information on node details, recent builds, resource consumption, and node events.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor the health of all Jenkins nodes to understand and resolve potential bottlenecks
* Monitor  node resource utilization and resize if necessary
* Monitor removed nodes and node offline and launch failure events to ensure intended operations are being performed

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-NodeHealth.png')} alt="jenkins" />


### Job Monitoring Dashboards

Job Monitoring Dashboards provide information on job activities like job run duration, job status, test results, pipeline stages, and console Logs. Job monitoring dashboards help you monitor job duration, status, failed jobs, and test cases. You can determine stack trace failures, failed stages details, source control management details, job configuration changes, and stage-wise console logs.


#### Job Overview Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Job Overview** dashboard provides a high-level view of the job and builds status, trends, comparisons, and results.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor the total number of builds, successful and failed builds.
* Monitor recent builds and view detailed information in  the Jenkins console
* Monitor  job duration trends to understand how to improve the execution of various stages in the pipeline
* Monitor  jobs in progress, and in queue to determine how the pipelines are performing and make adjustments to the build process if needed
* Identify the slowest failed builds
* View trends for job results and use that information to identify source code components and teams that need the most improvements

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-JobOverview.png')} alt="jenkins" />


#### Job Information Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Job Information** dashboard provides detailed information about a specific job. Panels show information on job URLs, duration trends, execution results, test case trends, slowest stages for pipeline jobs, console logs, and common errors.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor the total number of builds, successful builds, duration and failed builds for the job in question to understand how to best improve its execution going forward
*  Drilldown to Jenkins build information as needed
* Investigate common errors using console logs
* Investigate common stage failures
* Monitor recent configuration changes and commits to identify potential causes of failure

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-JobInformation.png')} alt="jenkins" />


#### Build Information Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Build Information** dashboard provides detailed information about a specific build. Panels show information on build parameters, source control management, commit details, test cases, pipeline stages, console logs, and configuration changes prior to a build.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor parameters used for the build and source control management, such as Github Repository, to understand recent commits that have been added to the build.
* Investigate possible causes for build failure using configuration change before build details, test case failure, commit changes, pipeline stage failure, and console logs.
* Investigate the cause for failed test cases by analyzing stack traces.
* Investigate configuration changes before the build by comparing the old configuration and current configurations.
* Identify command failure for pipeline jobs using stage and stack trace information.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/Jenkins-BuildInformation.png')} alt="jenkins" />


#### Pipeline Stage Monitoring Dashboard

The **Jenkins - Pipeline Stage Monitoring** dashboard provides insights into pipeline performances.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify which pipelines are taking the longest to complete.
* Drilldown to slowest stages and steps within each pipeline.
* Compare pipeline executions to identify which runs are slower or faster than others.
* Identify the failed pipeline stages and steps.
