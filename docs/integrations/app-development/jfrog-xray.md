The JFrog Xray app provides visibility into the state of artifacts and components in your JFrog Artifactory repository. The pre-configured dashboards present information about issues detected in your software components in Artifactory, including vulnerable containers, artifacts and components; license and security issues; and top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). The app also helps identify all incoming threats detected via Sumo Logic Threat Intel.

The Sumo Logic app for JFrog Xray and collection are tested on JFrog Xray 2.9.0 version.


## Log types

The JFrog Xray app uses the following log types:

* JFrog Xray logs. JFrog Xray logs are in JSON format. For more information, see JFrog Xray [Webhook payload](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/XRAY/Policies#Policies-WebhookPayload).
* Artifactory logs. For more information, see [Collect Logs for Artifactory.](/docs/integrations/app-development/jfrog-artifactory#Collect-Logs-for-Artifactory)
* Kubernetes logs. For more information, see [Collect Logs for Kubernetes.](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App)

## Collecting Logs for JFrog Xray

This section explains how to collect logs from JFrog Xray and ingest them into Sumo Logic for use with the JFrog Xray pre-defined dashboards and searches. To get the most of out this app, we recommend you also collect logs from Artifactory as well as Kubernetes.

### Step 1: Collect JFrog Xray instance details

In this step you collect details for your JFrog Xray instance that you will use in the following tasks.

Collect the following details:
* HostName and Port for your JFrog Xray instance â€” such as, JFrog instance URL **http://host-example:8000/web/#/login**
    * HostName = **host-example**
    * Port = **8000**
* Your Username and Password for your JFrog Xray instance


### Step 2: Collect Artifactory logs

We recommend collecting data from JFrog Artifactory so as to investigate sources of vulnerable artifacts and who is using them. This is done by correlating Xray logs with Artifactory logs.

To do so, follow the instructions in [Collect Logs for Artifactory](/docs/integrations/app-development/jfrog-artifactory#Collect-Logs-for-Artifactory).


### Step 3: Collect Kubernetes logs

If you have set up a Docker repository in Aritfactory and are running containers in a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend collecting data from your Kubernetes cluster so as to understand all vulnerable containers running in production.

To perform this setup, follow the instructions in [Collect Logs for Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App).


### Step 4: Add Hosted Collector and HTTP Source

In this step you set up a hosted Sumo Logic collector and HTTP source to collect JFrog Xray logs.

Identify an existing Sumo Logic Hosted Collector you want to use, or create a new Hosted Collector as described in the following task.

When you configure the HTTP source, make sure to save the HTTP Source Address URL. You will need it when you configure the webhook in [Step 5](#Step_5:_Set_up_a_collection_method_for_JFrog_Xray).  

To add a hosted collector and HTTP source:
1. Create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector by performing the steps in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Create a new HTTP source on the hosted collector created above by following [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).


### Step 5: Set up a collection method for JFrog Xray

This section covers the various ways in which to collect logs from JFrog Xray and send them to Sumo Logic. The logs are then shown in dashboards as part of the JFrog Xray App. You can configure a Sumo Logic collector for JFrog Xray in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using AWS Lambda service, or use a script on a Linux machine with a cron job. Choose the method that best suits your environment:

<details>
<summary>Method A: Sumo Logic JFrog Xray SAM application</summary>

In this collection method, you deploy the SAM application, which creates the necessary resources in your AWS account.

To deploy the Sumo Logic JFrog xray SAM Application, do the following:

1. Go to [https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications).
2. Search for **sumologic-jfrog-xray** and make sure  the checkbox **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** is checked, and click the app link when it appears.

1. When the page for the Sumo app appears, click **Deploy**.
2. Go to the **AWS Lambda > Functions >** **Application Settings** panel, and enter parameters for the following fields:
* **HTTPLogsEndpoint**: Copy and paste the URL for the HTTP log source from [Step 4](#step-4-add-hosted-collector-and-http-source).
* **Hostname**: Copy and paste the Hostname from [Step 1](#step-1-collect-jfrog-xray-instance-details).
* **Port**: Copy and paste the Port from [Step 1](#step-1-collect-jfrog-xray-instance-details).
* **Username**: Copy and paste the Username from [Step 1](#step-1-collect-jfrog-xray-instance-details).
* **Password**: Copy and paste the Password from [Step 1](#step-1-collect-jfrog-xray-instance-details).

1. Click **Deploy.**


#### Optional - Configure multiple JFrog Xray instances

If you have multiple JFrog Xray instances from which you want to collect logs and send to Sumo Logic, perform the following task.

To configure collection for multiple JFrog Xray instances, do the following:
1. [Deploy the SAM application](#Deploy+a+SAM+application) with configuration for a new project.
2. After the deployment is complete, change the database name by adding environment variable (**DBNAME**) in [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html).

<details>
<summary>Method B: Sumo Logic JFrog Xray Script-based collection</summary>

This section provides instructions for configuring script based collection for the Sumo Logic JFrog Xray App.

The _sumologic-jfrog-xray_ script is compatible with python 3.7 and python 2.7, and has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

#### Prerequisites
* You must have successfully added a **Hosted Collector** and **HTTP source **and copied details for JFrog Xray instance, as described in [Step 4](#step-4-add-hosted-collector-and-http-source).
* You must be logged in to the user account with which you will install the collector. If you are not, use the following command to switch to that account:  
```bash
sudo su <user_name>
```
* A Linux machine compatible with either Python 3.7 or Python 2.7


#### Step 1. Configure the script on a Linux machine

This task shows you how to install the script on a Linux machine.

For Python 3 you will use pip3 install **sumologic-jfrog-xray** (step 3 in the following task). For systems where Python 3 is not the default - you will use **/usr/bin/python3 -m sumojfrogxray.main** (step 5 in the following task).

To deploy the script, do the following:
1. If **pip** is not already installed, follow the instructions in the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to download and install **pip**.
2. Log in to a Linux machine compatible with either Python 3.7 or Python 2.7.
3. Do one of the following:
* For Python 2 - run the following command:
```bash
pip install sumologic-jfrog-xray
```
* For Python 3 - run the following command:
```bash
pip3 install sumologic-jfrog-xray
```
1. Create a configuration file **jfrogxraycollector.yaml** in the home directory as shown below, and fill in the parameter `<Variables>` where indicated.

1. Create a cron job to run the collector every 5 minutes, (use the crontab -e option), in one of the following ways:
* For Python 2 - add the following line in your crontab:
```sql
*/5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python -m sumojfrogxray.main > /dev/null 2>&1
```
* For Python 3 - add the following line in your crontab:
```sql
*/5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python3 -m sumojfrogxray.main > /dev/null 2>&1
```


**Optional - Configure collection for multiple projects**

If you have multiple projects from which you want to collect logs and send to Sumo Logic, perform the following task.

To configure collection for multiple projects, do the following:
1. [Configure the script on a Linux machine](#step-1-configure-the-script-on-a-linux-machine), then navigate to your configuration file.
2. Change the **DB_NAME** in the jfrogxraycollector.yaml, the `<DB NAME>` variable in the following example.

#### Step 2. Advanced configuration

Advanced configuration can be used with all JFrog Xray script-based collection configurations.

This section provides a list of variables for Jfrog Xray that you can define in the configuration file.

## Troubleshooting

This section shows you how to run the function manually and then verify that log messages are being sent from JFrog Xray.

To run the function manually, do the following:
1. Do one of the following:
   * For **python**, run this command:
   ```bash
   python -m sumojfrogxray.main
   ```
   * For **python3**, run this command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m sumojfrogxray.main
   ```
2. The script generates logs in **/tmp/sumoapiclient.log** by default. Check these logs to verify whether the script is getting triggered or not.
3. If you get an error such as unable to execute `'gcc': No such file or directory, error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`, go to your AWS EC2 instance and run the following commands:
```bash
sudo yum -y install gcc
sudo yum install python-devel
```


## Installing the JFrog Xray App
