The Sumo Logic App for Jira provides insight into Jira usage, request activity, issues, security, sprint events, and user events.   

The Jira App supports Jira Server. For Jira Cloud, please see documentation for the [Jira Cloud App](/docs/integrations/app-development/jira-cloud).


## Log Types

The Jira app uses the following log types:

* **Jira Access Logs**. Apache HTTP server log files, in `/var/log/apache2/*.log`.
* **Jira Security Logs**. Security-related information, such as logins, logouts, session creation/destruction, and security denials from `atlassian-jira-security.log`.
* **Jira Catalina Logs**. The application server log file, `logs/catalina.out`, in your JIRA Installation Directory.
* **Jira Webhooks**. Webhook events of types:
    * Issue
    * User
    * Sprint

For more information, see [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) in Jira help.

### Sample Query

```sql title="Users created"
_sourceCategory=Jira/events (user_created or user_deleted or user_updated)
| json  "webhookEvent", "user.emailAddress", "user.displayName", "user.name", "timestamp" as event_name, user_email, user_name, user, timestamp nodrop
| where event_name ="user_created"
| formatDate(fromMillis(timestamp), "MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss") as date_time
| count by date_time, user_email, user_name
| fields - _count
| sort by date_time desc
```

## Collecting Logs for the Jira App

This section has instructions for collecting logs from Jira for the Sumo App for Jira.

The Jira App supports Jira Server. For Jira Cloud, please see documentation for the [Jira Cloud App](/docs/integrations/app-development/jira-cloud).

You will configure an installed collector on your Jira host with three local file sources, for collecting Jira access, security, and catalina logs. You also configure a hosted collector with an HTTP source for receiving webhook events from Jira.


### Set up local file sources on an installed collector

1. Install a collector on the JIRA host. You can find the instructions for your operating system on [Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
2. Add a local file source to the collector for Jira access logs. Follow the steps on [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source), with these additional instructions:
    * **Filepath**. On Linux, access logs are typically found in `/var/log/apache2/*.log`.
    * **Source Category**. Set to:` Atlassian/Jira/Server/Access`
3. Add a local file source to the collector for Jira security logs. Follow the steps on [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source), with these additional instructions:
    * **Filepath**.  On Linux, security logs are typically found in `/home/jira/atlassian/application-data/jira/log/atlassian-jira-security.log`.
    * **Source Category**. Set to: `Atlassian/Jira/Server/Security`
4. Add a local file source to the collector for Jira Catalina logs. Follow the steps on [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source), with these additional instructions:
    * **Filepath**. On Linux, Catalina logs are typically found in `/home/jira/atlassian/application-data/jira/log/*.log`.
    * **Source Category**. Set to: `Atlassian/Jira/Server/Catalina`


### Configure hosted collector to receive Webhooks

In this step, you create a host collector to receive webhooks from Jira, and set up an HTTP source on it.

1. Configure a [hosted collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector), or select an existing hosted collector for the HTTP source.
2. Configure an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) on the hosted collector.
    * For **Source Category**, specify `Atlassian/Jira/Events`
    * Make a note of the HTTP address for the source. You will supply it when you configure a Jira webhook in the next step.


### Register webhook in Jira

Follow the instructions on [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) in Jira help to register a webhook for the following events:

* Issue related:
    * created (jira:issue_created)
    * updated (jira:issue_updated)
    * deleted (jira:issue_deleted)
    * worklog changed (jira:worklog_updated)
* User related:
    * created (user_created)
    * updated (user_updated)
    * deleted (user_deleted)
* Sprint related:
    * created (sprint_created)
    * deleted (sprint_deleted)
    * updated (sprint_updated)
    * started (sprint_started)
    * closed (sprint_closed)

When you configure the webhook, enter the URL for the HTTP source you created in [step 2](#Step_2:_Configure_hosted_collector_to_receive_webhooks) as the endpoint for the webhook.



## Installing the Jira App

Now that you have set up collection for Jira, install the Jira app to use the pre-configured dashboards for insights into your data.

The Jira App supports Jira Server. For Jira Cloud, please see documentation for the [Jira Cloud App](/docs/integrations/app-development/jira-cloud).

To install the app, do the following:

1. From the App Catalog, search for and select the app.
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library**.
   * **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
   * **Jira Server Log data source.** Set **Source Category** to `Atlassian/Jira/Server*`.
   * **Jira Webhook source.** Set **Source Category** to `Atlassian/Jira/Events`.
3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.


## Viewing Jira Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).

You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level.


### Overview

The **Jira - Overview** dashboard provides a high-level view of Jira activities, including the location of event authentications, login comparisons, Jira requests, errors and error trends, and data usage.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor Jira activity.
* Compare today's activity with yesterday's.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/jira-overview.png')} alt="Jira" />


### Access

The **Jira - Access** dashboard provides information about Jira user access, including request trends, average response times, issues by project, response codes, and errors.

Use this dashboard to:
* Track requests received by Jira.
* Identify spikes in request volume.
* Monitor current and recent data usage (bytes transferred) and HTTP response codes.
* Drill down by a specific protocol or response codes.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/jira-access.png')} alt="Jira" />


### Catalina

The **Jira - Catalina** dashboard provides information on the Jira internal web server. Panels display analytics for errors, failures, exceptions, request trends, and top ranked URLs.

Use this dashboard to:

* Find and debug unexpected errors in Jira.
* Monitor the number requests received over time.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/app-development/jira-catalina.png')} alt="Jira" />

### Issue Overview
