The Sumo Logic app for Jira provides insight into Jira usage, request activity, issues, security, sprint events, and user events. 

Jira logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for Jira

Following are the tags which will be created as part of the Jira App install if not already present. 

- `sumo.datasource`. Has fixed value of **jira**.

## Prerequisites

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Jira running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for Jira. Sumo Logic supports the collection of logs from Jira server in standalone environments.

Follow the instructions to set up log collection.

The Jira app uses the following log types:
- **Jira Access Logs**. HTTP server access log files, in `logs/access_logs`,  in your JIRA Installation Directory.
- **Jira Security Logs**. Security-related information, such as logins, logouts, session creation/destruction, and security denials from `atlassian-jira-security.log`.
- **Jira Catalina Logs**. The application catalina log file, `logs/catalina.out`, in your JIRA Installation Directory.
- **Jira Webhooks**. Webhook events of types:
    - Issue
    - User
    - Sprint

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

<LogsCollectionPrereqisites/>

For Windows systems, log files which are collected should be accessible by the SYSTEM group. Use the following set of PowerShell commands if the SYSTEM group does not have access.

```
$NewAcl = Get-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>"
# Set properties
$identity = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
$fileSystemRights = "ReadAndExecute"
$type = "Allow"
# Create new rule
$fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList = $identity, $fileSystemRights, $type
$fileSystemAccessRule = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule -ArgumentList $fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList
# Apply new rule
$NewAcl.SetAccessRule($fileSystemAccessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" -AclObject $NewAcl
```

## Configure hosted collector to receive Webhooks

In this step, you create a host collector to receive webhooks from Jira and set up an HTTP source on it.

1. Configure a [hosted collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector/), or select an existing hosted collector for the HTTP source.
2. Configure an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) on the hosted collector.
    - For Source Category, specify Atlassian/Jira/Events
    - Add `sumo.datasource` as File to this source and assign the value **jira** for it.<br/> <img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Jira-OpenTelemetry/Jira-Datasource.png' alt="Datasource" width="350"/>
    - Make a note of the HTTP address for the source. You will supply it when you configure a Jira webhook in the next step.

## Register webhook in Jira

Follow the instructions on [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) in Jira help to register a webhook for the following events:
- Issue related:
    - created (jira:issue_created)
    - updated (jira:issue_updated)
    - deleted (jira:issue_deleted)
    - worklog changed (jira:worklog_updated)
- User related:
    - created (user_created)
    - updated (user_updated)
    - deleted (user_deleted)
- Sprint related:
    - created (sprint_created)
    - deleted (sprint_deleted)
    - updated (sprint_updated)
    - started (sprint_started)
    - closed (sprint_closed)

When you configure the webhook, enter the URL for the [HTTP source you created](/docs/integrations/app-development/jira/#configure-hosted-collector-to-receive-webhooks) as the endpoint for the webhook.

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Jira-OpenTelemetry/Jira-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid black'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml file required for Jira Collection.

Path of the different log file configured to capture Jira logs is needed to be given here:
- Jira Access Logs. Apache HTTP server log files. Default path `/var/log/apache2/*.log`.
- Jira Security Logs. Security-related information. Default path `/home/jira/atlassian/application-data/jira/log/atlassian-jira-security.log`.
- Jira Catalina Logs. The application server log file. Default path `/home/jira/atlassian/application-data/jira/log/*.log`.

Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Jira-OpenTelemetry/Jira-YAML.png' style={{border:'1px solid black'}} alt="YAML" />

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Copy the yaml file to `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Jira instance that needs to be monitored.
2. Place Env file in the following directory:
  ```sh
  /etc/otelcol-sumo/env/
  ```
3. Restart the collector using:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart otelcol-sumo
  ```
