The Sumo Logic App for Jira Cloud provides insights into how your Jira projects and issues are being managed so as to enable you to be more effective and manage work across multiple teams. This guide provides instructions for installing and configuring the Jira Cloud App, as well as offering examples and descriptions of the app pre-configured dashboards.


## Log Types

The Jira Cloud App uses the following types of logs:

* Issue related events
* Project-related events
* User related events
* Jira configuration related events
* Jira Software related events

For more information, see [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/webhooks/) in Jira help


### Sample Log Messages

## Collecting Logs for the Jira Cloud App

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Jira Cloud App.

Configuring log collection consists of the following tasks:
* **Configuring a Hosted Collector in Sumo Logic to receive Jira Cloud Events:** A Hosted Collector is installed to receive the Webhooks from Jira. The Webhooks configuration helps to notify the app or web application when certain events occur in Jira. Using the Webhooks the remote applications do not have to monitor whether changes have occurred
* **Registering a Webhook in Jira Cloud:** Webhooks are registered in Jira for various events by Jira administration console or Jira REST API methods. These Webhooks can be used as an alert to the remote application when the issues are updated or sprints are started.

For more information, please see the [documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/webhooks/) for Webhooks in Jira Cloud.


### Step 1: Configure Hosted Collector to Receive Webhooks

In this step, you create a host collector to receive Webhooks from Jira and set up an HTTP source on it.
1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector), or select an existing hosted collector for the HTTP source.
2. Configure an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) on the hosted collector.
    * For **Source Category**, specify `jira_cloud/events`.
    * Make a note of the HTTP address for the source. You will supply it when you configure a Jira Webhook in the next step.


### Step 2: Register Webhook in Jira

Follow the instructions on [Webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiracloud/managing-webhooks-776636231.html) in Jira help to register a Webhook for the following events:


#### Issue Related Events

* Issue
    * created
    * updated
    * deleted
* Comment
    * created
    * updated
    * deleted
* Attachment
    * created
    * deleted
* Worklog
    * created
    * updated
    * deleted
* Entity property
    * created or updated

* Issue link
    * created
    * deleted


#### Project-related Events

* Version
    * released
    * unreleased
    * created
    * moved
    * updated
    * merged
    * deleted
* Project
    * created
    * updated
    * deleted


#### User-Related Events

* User
    * created
    * deleted
    * updated


#### Jira Configuration Related Events

* Features status change (enabled/disabled)
    * voting
    * watching
    * unassigned issues
    * subtasks
    * attachments
    * issue links
    * time tracking
    * time tracking provider


#### Jira Software Related Events

* Board
    * created
    * deleted
    * updated
    * configuration changed

#### Sprint Events

* Sprint
    * created
    * deleted
    * updated
    * started
    * closed

When you configure the Webhook, enter the URL for the HTTP source you created in [Step 2](#Step_2:__Register_Webhook_in_Jira) as the endpoint for the Webhook.




## Installing the Jira Cloud App

This section demonstrates how to install the Jira Cloud App.

To install the app, do the following:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library.](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library)
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`). 
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## Viewing Jira Cloud Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards-new/filter-template-variables.md).
