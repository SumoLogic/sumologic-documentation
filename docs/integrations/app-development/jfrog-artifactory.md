JFrog Artifactory is a universal artifact repository manager that integrates with CI/CD and DevOps tools to provide artifact tracking. The Sumo Logic apps for Artifactory 6 and Artifactory 7 provide insight into your JFrog Artifactory binary repository. Our preconfigured dashboards provide an overview of your system as well as Traffic, Requests and Access, Download Activity, Cache Deployment Activity, and Non-Cached Deployment Activity.

If you _do not_ have a Sumo Logic account and want to get up and running quickly, the [JFrog Artifactory Sumo Logic integration](#if-you-do-not-have-a-sumo-logic-account) is the most convenient way to get started. It allows you to access Sumo Logic directly from Artifactory.

If you have an existing Sumo Logic account, you can still use the integration, however, this will create a secondary Sumo Logic account. To use your existing account, install the [Sumo Logic app for Artifactory](#installing-the-artifactory-app) instead of the integration and access your Artifactory data from Sumo Logic, rather than your Artifactory instance.  

## Prerequisites

* If you're using Artifactory Online, you'll need use the [integration](#artifactory-online-sumo-logic-integration) (our [app](#installing-the-artifactory-app) is not compatible with Artifactory Online).
* If you're using Artifactory On-Premise, you can use our [app](#installing-the-artifactory-app) or the [integration](#artifactory-online-sumo-logic-integration).


## Artifactory 6

### Log types

The Sumo Logic app for Artifactory 6 collects data from the following logs:

* `artifactory.log`. The main Artifactory log file that contains data on Artifactory server activity.
* `access.log`. The security log containing important information about accepted and denied requests, configuration changes, and password reset requests. The originating IP address for each event is also recorded.
* `request.log`. Generic HTTP traffic information similar to the Apache HTTPd request log.
* `traffic.log`. A log that contains information about site traffic and file sizes.

For more details about Artifactory logs, refer to the [JFrog Logging documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+Log+Files) and [Artifactory Log Files](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF6X/Artifactory+Log+Files#ArtifactoryLogFiles-RequestLog).

Sumo Logic reads logs in the directory `/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs`:
* `artifactory.log`
* `access.log`
* `request.log`
* `traffic.*.log`

### Collecting logs

This section demonstrates how to collect logs from JFrog Artifactory 6 into Sumo Logic.

#### Step 1: Activate the traffic.log file

To activate the `traffic.log` file, add the following parameter to your `artifactory.system.properties` file, located under `$ARTIFACTORY/etc`:
```bash
artifactory.traffic.collectionActive=true
```

A restart is required for traffic collection to take effect.

#### Step 2: Configure a Collector

Configure an [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).

#### Step 3: Configure Sources

In this step, you configure four local file sources, one for each log source listed in the table below. When you create a file source for a log type:

* Use the value from the File Path column below as the **File Path** for the source.  
* The value you specify for the source's **Source Category** _must_ end with the suffix shown below in the Source Category column. For example, you could set the Source Category for the Artifactory Server log source to be `foo/artifactory/console`, but not `artifactory/console/foo`.

The following suffixes are required. For example, you could use `_sourceCategory=<Foo>/artifactory/console`, but the suffix `artifactory/console` must be used.

<table><small>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Log source</strong></td>
   <td><strong>File Path</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Source Category</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Artifactory Server</td>
   <td>/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/artifactory.log</td>
   <td>artifactory/console</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Access</td>
   <td>/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/access.log</td>
   <td>artifactory/access</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Request</td>
   <td>/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/request.log</td>
   <td>artifactory/request</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Traffic</td>
   <td>/var/opt/jfrog/artifactory/logs/traffic.*.log</td>
   <td>artifactory/traffic</td>
  </tr></small>
</table>

:::note
`_sourceCategory` names are case sensitive. When you run a search using `_sourceCategory`, make sure you use the same case as you did when configuring the source.
:::

For complete instructions, see [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).

1. Configure a Local File source.
2. Configure the Source fields:
    * **Name** (required). A name is required.
    * **Description** (Optional).
    * **Source Category**. (required).
3. Configure the Advanced section:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. True.
    * **Time Zone**. Logs are in UTC by default.
    * **Timestamp Format**. Auto Detect.
    * **Encoding Type**. UTF-8.
    * **Multi-line Parsing**. Detect Messages Spanning Multiple Lines, Infer Boundaries.
4. Click **Save**.


## Artifactory 7

This procedure documents how to collect logs from JFrog Artifactory 7 into Sumo Logic.


### Log types

For each JFrog service, you will find its active log files in the `$JFROG_HOME/<product>/var/log` directory. For consistency, each log file is prefixed by its service name and a dash, `<service-name>-service.log`. For example, artifactory-service.log and router-request.log.

* `artifactory-service.log`
* `artifactory-access.log`
* `artifactory-request.log`
* `artifactory-traffic.*.log`

For more information, see JFrog's [Artifactory Log Files](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Logging) and [Access Logs](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Access+Log) documentation.

### Collecting logs

#### Step 1: Activate the traffic.log file

1. To activate the **traffic.log** file, add the following parameter to your **artifactory.system.properties** file, located under **$ARTIFACTORY/etc**:
   ```bash
   $JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/artifactory/artifactory.system.properties
   ```
2. A restart is required for traffic collection to take effect.

#### Step 2: Configure a collector

Configure an [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).


#### Step 3: Configure sources

In this step, you configure four local file sources, one for each log source listed in the table below. When you create a file source for a log type:

* Use the value from the File Path column below as the **File Path** for the source.  
* The value you specify for the source's **Source Category** _must_ end with the suffix shown below in the Source Category column. For example, you could set the Source Category for the Artifactory Server log source to be `foo/artifactory/` console, but not `artifactory/console/foo`.

The following suffixes are required. For example, you could use `_sourceCategory=<Foo>/artifactory/console`, but the suffix **artifactory/console** must be used.

## Artifactory Online Sumo Logic integration

The JFrog Artifactory Sumo Logic integration provides the ability to access preconfigured Sumo Logic Dashboards directly from Artifactory that will allow you to analyze data from your Artifactory logs.

**If you do not have an existing Sumo Logic account**, enable the JFrog Artifactory Sumo Logic integration directly from Artifactory. When you enable the integration, a Sumo Logic Connector and Source get automatically configured, and the Sumo Logic App for Artifactory gets installed automatically. The JFrog Artifactory Sumo Logic integration provides a new Sumo Logic Free account with a daily data volume limit of 500MB per day, with 30 users and 14 days of data retention.

**If you have an existing Sumo Logic account**, you can configure Artifactory Online to send data (described below) to an existing Sumo Logic [HTTP Logs and Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) source.

### Collect Artifactory logs

The integration collects data from the following Artifactory logs:

* **artifactory.log**. The main Artifactory log file that contains data on Artifactory server activity.
* **access.log**. The security log containing important information about accepted and denied requests, configuration changes, and password reset requests. For each event, the originating IP address gets recorded.
* **request.log**. Generic HTTP traffic information similar to the Apache HTTPd request log.
* **traffic.*.log**. A log containing information about site traffic and file sizes.

For more details about Artifactory logs, refer to [JFrog's Artifactory Log Files](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+Log+Files).

## Field Extraction Rules

Here are Artifactory extraction rules that use different approaches.

```sql title="Traffic"
_sourceCategory=*artifactory*
| where _sourceCategory matches "*artifactory/traffic"
| parse regex "(?<year>\d{4})(?<month>\d{2})(?<day>\d{2})(?<hour>\d{2})(?<minute>\d{2})(?<second>\d{2})\|\d*\|(?<direction>[^|]*)\|\s*(?<ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}|[^|]*)\|(?<repo>[^:]*):(?<fullfilepath>[^|]*)\|(?<size>\d*)" nodrop
```

```sql title="Access Logs"
_sourceCategory=*artifactory*
| where _sourceCategory matches "*artifactory/access"
| parse "[*] *:* for */*" as what, repo, path, user, ip
```

```sql title="Request Logs"
_sourceCategory=*artifactory*
| where _sourceCategory matches "*artifactory/request"
| parse "*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*|*" as datetime, response_time, type, ip, user, method, path, protocol, status_code, size
```

## Installing the Artifactory app

Now that you have set up collection, install the Sumo Logic app for Artifactory to use the pre-configured searches and Dashboards that provide insight into your data.
