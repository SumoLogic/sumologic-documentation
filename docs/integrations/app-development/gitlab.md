The Sumo Logic App for GitLab provides you a complete overview of your GitLab’s builds, deployments, pipelines, issues, merge requests, and commits. The integration listens for GitLab events and uses the event data to populate the pre-configured Dashboards.


## Event Types

The Sumo Logic App for GitLab ingests GitLab events using a webhook. Sumo Logic ingests all events, but only uses the following events in the Dashboards:

* Job
* Deployment
* Pipeline
* Merge Request
* Issue
* Push

For information on GitLab events, refer to [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html). For troubleshooting, see the [GitLab Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.


### Sample Logs

For more information about log messages, see [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html).


### Sample queries

This section provides a sample query from the **Opened Merge Requests** panel on the **GitLab - Merge Requests** dashboard.

```sql
_sourceCategory="sumo/GitLab" and _collector="GitLab" %"x-GitLab-event"="Merge Request Hook"
|json "object_attributes.state" as merge_request_state
| where merge_request_state="opened"
|json "object_attributes.action" ,"object_attributes.title", "object_attributes.created_at","object_attributes.updated_at","user.name","repository.name","object_attributes.merge_when_pipeline_succeeds","object_attributes.url","object_attributes.source_branch","object_attributes.target_branch","project.name","object_attributes.id"   as action, title, created_time , updated_time,user,repo_name,branch_deleted, url,source_branch,target_branch,project,merge_request_id nodrop
| where user matches "*" and repo_name matches "*" and project matches "*" and merge_request_id matches "*"  and merge_request_state matches "*"
| where action in ("open","reopen")
| count by repo_name
| sort by _count
```


## Collecting Logs for the GitLab App

This guide provides instructions for collecting logs for the Sumo Logic App for GitLab.

Configuring log collection consists of the following tasks:

* **Configuring a Hosted Collector in Sumo Logic to receive GitLab Events:** A Hosted Collector is installed to receive the Webhooks from GitLab. The Webhooks configuration helps to notify the app or web application when certain events occur in GitLab. Using the Webhooks the remote applications do not have to monitor whether changes have occurred
* **Registering a Webhook in GitLab:** Webhooks are registered in GitLab for various events by the GitLab administration console.

For information on GitLab webhooks, refer to [GitLab documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html).


### Step 1: Configure Hosted Collector to Receive Webhooks

Create a host collector to receive Webhooks from GitLab and set up an HTTP source on it.

1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector), or select an existing hosted collector for the HTTP source.
2. Configure an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) on the hosted collector.
    * For **Source Category**, specify GitLab/events.
    * Click **+Add Field** and provide the following:
        * **Field Name.** `_convertHeadersToFields`
        * **Value.** `true`
    * Make note of the HTTP address for the source. You will supply it when you configure a GitLab Webhook in the next step.


### Step 2: Register Webhook in GitLab

In GitLab, configure a Webhook to connect to your Sumo Logic HTTP Source. You can configure the Webhook at the Project or [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#group-webhooks) level. Once configured, it will trigger each time one or more subscribed events occur in that Project or Group.

1. Sign in to your GitLab account.
2. Go to your Project or Group.
3. Click **Settings > Webhooks**.
4. Enter Webhook form data as follows:
    * **URL**. Enter the Sumo Logic HTTP Source Address you created in Step 1.
    * **Secret Token**. Leave blank.
    * **Trigger**. Tick all checkboxes.
5. **SSL Verification**. Check the box to enable.
6. Click **Add Webhook**.

You can register webhooks for a [Group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#group-webhooks) or a Project. [Group webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#group-webhooks) ensure all projects in the group receive the same webhook settings.

Refer to the [GitLab Webhooks documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#configure-a-webhook) to understand more.


### Step 3: Enable GitLab Event tagging at Sumo Logic

Sumo Logic needs to understand the event type for incoming events. To enable this, the [x-gitlab-event](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhook_events.html#push-events) event type needs to be enabled. To enable this, perform the following steps in the Sumo Logic console:

1. In Sumo Logic, click **Manage Data > Logs** > [Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md#add-field).
2. Add Field ‎**x-GitLab-event**‎.


## Installing the GitLab App


import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>


### Troubleshooting

If you are getting the following error in the app dashboards after installation:

```bash
Field x-gitlab-event not found, please check the spelling and try again.
```

Do the following to resolve:

1. Close all app dashboards.
2. In Sumo Logic, click **Manage Data > Logs** > [Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md#add-field) and delete the **x-gitlab-event field.**
3. Add it again using the Dropped Fields section:
    * At **Dropped Fields** dropdown, click on **x-gitlab-event**, then click **Create Field** to create the field.
    * Wait for new events to be pushed from GitLab. The app should work without any `Field x-gitlab-event not found` errors.
4. Re-open GitLab dashboards.


## Viewing GitLab Dashboards

### Overview

The **GitLab - Overview** dashboard provides users with a high-level view of events such as Issues, Merge Requests, Builds, Deployments, and pipelines.

Use this dashboard to:
* Get insight into the number of opened and closed Issues and Merge Requests.
* Get insight into the number of successful and failed Builds, Deployments, and Pipelines.
* Get details like average duration to close issue, the average duration of a build by project, and average duration of a pipeline by projects.
