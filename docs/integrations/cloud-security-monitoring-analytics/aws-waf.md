AWS WAF (web application firewall) data is a rich source of security findings, as it allows you to monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront and let you control overall access to your content. Each dashboard within this application takes a different lens on AWS WAF data, from traffic patterns to threat intelligence, allowing you to truly identify the needles in the haystack that drives critical security concerns within your AWS infrastructure.

## Collecting Logs for AWS WAF Security Analytics

To configure Collection for AWS WAF App, follow the instructions from [Collecting Logs for the AWS WAF App](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/waf#collecting-logs-for-the-aws-waf-app).

## Installing the AWS WAF Security Analytics App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS WAF, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS WAF to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
