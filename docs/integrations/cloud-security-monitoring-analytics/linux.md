The Cloud Security monitoring and Analytics app for Linux ingests any distribution of linux data to gain a better understanding of your production environments, and surface relevant insights by tuning out-of-the-box content to align with your security team’s focus. Consolidate analytics across various instances by wildcarding on data sources and gain full visibility into your Linux data for both monitoring and analytics use cases.

Follow the steps in this topic to install or uninstall a collector on Linux. See Installed Collectors for information on other OSs.


## System Requirements

* Linux, major distributions 64-bit, or any generic Unix capable of running Java 1.8
* Single core, 512MB RAM
* 8GB disk space
* Package installers require TLS 1.2 or higher.


## Collecting Data for the Linux Integration

### Download the Collector

Download the collector in either of the following ways:

* In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**. Click **Add Collector**, click **Installed Collector**, and then click the link for the collector to begin the download.<br/>
-or-
* Open a browser and enter the static URL for your pod. See Download a Collector from a Static URL for a list of URLs for your deployment pod. The download begins immediately.


### Install the Collector on Linux

Choose one of these methods to install the Collector:

<details>
<summary>Install Using the UI Installer</summary>

Run the installer on your server with root or Administrator privileges. If you are not logged in as root or Administrator, you might be prompted to reauthenticate to your system when you start the UI Installer.

1. Open the downloaded installer file.
2. If prompted, enter the root or Administrator user name and password for the system.
3. Open the wizard to show the Welcome page. Click **Next**.
4. Accept the license agreement and click **Next**.
5. Browse to select a location for the collector or accept the default and click **Next** to install the Collector files on your machine.
6. The Installer displays the summary of the default settings. If you want to change any of these, click Advanced UI Installer Settings and follow the instructions. Click **Next**.
7. Choose an authentication method.
   * Access Key: If you have a Sumo Logic access ID and key, click **Next**, enter the access ID and key, and click **Next**.
   * Installation Token: The [Setup Wizard](/docs/send-data/setup-wizard) has not yet been updated to provide an option for Installation Tokens. You can provide the Installation Token using the Setup Wizard Token option. Enter the **Token String** you want to use to register the Collector in the input box for a Setup Wizard one-time token.
   * Setup Wizard Token: If the Setup Wizard has provided you with a token for the UI Installer, click **Next**, enter the token, and click **Next**. The Setup Wizard Token is a one-time use token, available for one hour after it is generated, then it expires. This token authenticates the user. It is designed to be used for only one Collector. The token cannot be used with the API, and it cannot be disabled.
8. Click **Finish** to complete the setup.
9. In Sumo Logic select** Manage Data > Collection > Collection** and verify that you can see the Collector. Look for the name that is listed as Collector Name in the confirmation step of this procedure (the name can be customized under **Advanced Settings**). If a Collector with that name already exists, a suffix is appended to uniquely identify it. If you don’t see the collector, check the Error Codes list to help troubleshoot.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install Using the Command-Line Installer</summary>

1. Add execution permissions to the downloaded Collector file (.sh):
 ```bash
 chmod +x SumoCollector.sh
 ```
2. Run the script with the parameters that you want to configure. See Parameters for the Command Line Installer for a description of the parameters. By default, the Collector will be installed in either /opt/SumoCollector or /usr/local/SumoCollector.

**Examples**

```bash title="Using an Installation Token"
sudo ./SumoCollector.sh -q -Vsumo.token_and_url=<installationToken> -Vsources=<absolute_filepath>
```

```bash title="Using access ID and access key"
sudo ./SumoCollector.sh -q -Vsumo.accessid=<accessId> -Vsumo.accesskey=<accessKey> -Vsources=<absolute_filepath>
```

```bash title="Adding proxy settings"
sudo ./SumoCollector.sh -q -Vsumo.accessid=<accessId> -Vsumo.accesskey=<accessKey> -Vsources=<absolute_filepath> -Vproxy.host=<proxyHost> -Vproxy.port=<proxyPort>
```

```bash title="Including syncSources and a customized Collector name"
sudo ./SumoCollector.sh -q -Vsumo.accessid=<accessId> -Vsumo.accesskey=<accessKey> -VsyncSources=<absolute_filepath> -Vcollector.name=<name>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install Using the RPM or Debian Package</summary>

You can use the RPM or Debian package to install a Collector on a Linux 64-bit system.

1. Install the Collector using the downloaded installation package.
   * For the RPM package, use the command:
    ```bash
    sudo rpm -i SumoCollector-19.XXX-XX.x86_64.rpm
    ```
   * For the Debian package, use the command:
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i SumoCollector-19.XXX-XX.x86_64.deb
    ```

   The RPM and Debian packages install the collector in the /opt/SumoCollector directory.  By default, the Collector is installed as a system service, but not yet started.
2. Configure the Collector user.properties file in the /opt/SumoCollector/config/ directory. The Collector uses the settings defined in user.properties to register and start. See user.properties for a full list of all the supported parameters.
   * To use an access key, provide the accessid and accesskey parameters. For example:
    ```bash
    name = <collectorName>
    accessid = <accessId>
    accesskey = <accessKey>
    ```
   * To use an installation token, provide the authentication parameters token and url. To use these two parameters you'll need to manually base64 decode the **Token String**. Once decoded, you'll have a string with a token and a URL. For example, the following decoded **Token String**: `sumoxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxhttps://collectors.sumologic.com` would be used as:
    ```bash
    name = <collectorName>
    url=https://collectors.sumologic.com
    token=SUMOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```

:::note
* Starting with collector 19.170+, the installation directory is secured to users belonging to the `sumologic_collector` group.
* Modifying user.properties may require sudo privileges. For more information, see Enhanced File System Security for Installed Collectors.
:::

3. (Optional) Provide a JSON Source information. You can pass all Source settings in a UTF-8 encoded JSON file. If you're using a JSON file, you must provide the file before starting the Collector. See Using JSON to configure Sources. Alternatively, you can configure Sources at any time by using the Sumo web app. See Sources.
4. (Optional) Set the run a user for the Collector if you want the Collector to run as a user other than root. See run as for a Collector.
5. (Optional on Collector version 19.253-3+ in the Fed deployment) Enable FIPS 140-2 compliant Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to encrypt your data to Sumo Logic's Fed deployment in US1 only. FIPS mode is not supported for any other deployment. If you are unsure whether you are on the Fed deployment, check our deployments. To enable, locate and run the script `configureFipsMode.sh` contained in Collector's installation directory under `/script`:
 ```bash
 $ sh ./script/configureFipsMode.sh
 ```
6. Start the Collector using the following command.
 ```bash
 sudo service collector start
 ```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Install using the Binary Package</summary>

1. Install the version of JRE you want to use from the following location. (The collector requires Java 8 or higher). The binary installation process does not include JRE installation.
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html)
2. Check the version of Java is 8 or higher:
 ```bash
 java -version
 ```
3. Untar the downloaded binary file inside your desired destination directory to create a subdirectory named `sumocollector`:
 ```bash
 tar -xvf SumoCollector_unix_XXX.tar.gz
 ```
4. Copy the platform-specific wrapper file to the **sumocollector** directory:
 ```bash
 cp tanuki/wrapper-<platform>
 ```
5. Make the **wrapper**, **collector**, and **script** directory files executable:
 ```bash
 chmod ug+x wrapper-<platform>
 chmod ug+x collector
 chmod ug+x script/*
 ```
6. Configure the Collector  user.properties file in the /opt/SumoCollector/config/ directory. The Collector uses the settings defined in user.properties to register and start. See user.properties for a full list of all the supported parameters. To use an access key, provide the accessid and accesskey parameters. For example:
 ```bash
 name = <collectorName>
 accessid = <accessId>
 accesskey = <accessKey>
 wrapper.java.command = java
 ```
To use an installation token, provide the authentication parameters token and url. To use these two parameters you'll need to manually base64 decode the **Token String**. Once decoded you'll have a string with a token and a URL.
For example, the following decoded **Token String**:
`SUMOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXhttps://collectors.sumologic.com`
would be used as:
 ```bash
 name = <collectorName>
 url=https://collectors.sumologic.com
 token=SUMOXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 wrapper.java.command = java
 ```
7. Set access control for files under the **sumocollector** directory:
```bash
sudo script/secureFiles.sh
```
8. (Optional) Provide JSON Source information.
You can pass all Source settings in a UTF-8 encoded JSON file. If you're using a JSON file, you must provide the file before starting the Collector. See Using JSON to configure Sources.
Alternatively, you can configure sources at any time by using the Sumo web app. See Sources.
9. (Optional) Set the run as user for the Collector if you want the Collector to run as a user other than root. See run as for a Collector.
10. (Optional on Collector version 19.253-3+) Enable FIPS 140-2 compliant Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) to encrypt your data. Once enabled, the Collector version cannot be downgraded below version 19.253-3. To enable, locate and run the script **configureFipsMode.sh** contained in Collector's installation directory under **/script**:
 ```bash
 $ sh ./script/configureFipsMode.sh
 ```
11. Install the Collector as a service.
Use the following command to install the Collector as a service that is started when the machine starts.
 ```bash
 sudo ./collector install
 ```
12. Start the Collector service.
Use the following command to start the collector service.
 ```bash
 sudo ./collector start
 ```
13. To verify that the collector is installed, go to **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection** in the Sumo web app and verify that you can see the collector.

</details>

You can build a Collector into a Linux machine image such as an Amazon AMI or VMware image.

After installing Collectors, you can configure Sources from Sumo Logic or by providing the Source settings in a JSON file. If you're using a UTF-8 encoded JSON file, you must provide the file before starting the collector. The JSON file needs to be UTF-8 encoded.
