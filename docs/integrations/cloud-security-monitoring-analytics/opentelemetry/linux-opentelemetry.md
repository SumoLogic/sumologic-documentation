Linux - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics - OpenTelemetry is a unified log app that ingests distribution of Linux data to Sumo Logic via OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver). The app's preconfigured dashboards provide insight into user, service, systems, login, and privilege activity, providing a better understanding of your production environments and surface relevant insights by tuning out-of-the-box content to align with your security team's focus.

## Fields created in Sumo Logic for Linux - Security Analytics

The following tag will be created as part of Linux app installation, if not already present.

- `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **linux**.

## Prereqisites

This app is based on the following log files from the Ubuntu Linux machine.

- auth.log
- syslog
- daemon.log
- dpkg.log
- kern.log
- CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat
- audit/audit.log
- secure
- messages
- yum.log

:::note
If you've already configured collection of these log files (for example, during Linux or Linux - PCI app setup), then no additional log file collection is required. If any of the log files are missing, you can configure the missing file collection in the next step.
:::

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

<LogsCollectionPrereqisites/>

## Collection configuration and app installation

:::note
You can skip this section if you have already set up the logs collection through [Linux](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/opentelemetry/linux-opentelemetry/) or [Linux PCI](/docs/integrations/pci-compliance/opentelemetry/linux-opentelemetry) app installation. Additional collection is not required as the logs used by this app are already ingested into Sumo Logic.
:::

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/PCI-Compliance-For-Linux/OpenTelemetry/Linux-Collector.png' alt="Linux-Collector" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the YAML required for Linux collection. The app requires path for system log file based on the Linux version used.

#### Required Logs for Ubuntu

The following logs, located in the `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo Logic app for Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics for Linux with Ubuntu.

- auth.log
- syslog
- daemon.log
- dpkg.log
- kern.log

#### Required Logs for CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat

The following logs, located in the `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo Logic app for Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics for Linux with CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat.

- audit/audit.log
- secure
- Messages
- yum.log

Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the YAML file.

:::note
By default, the path for Linux log files required for all the distros are pre-populated in the UI. (Optional) Unwanted file paths can be removed from the list if the files are not available on your Linux distribution. The collection will work even if not all the files are present in your system.

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

<LogsIntro/>

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Copy the yaml file to `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Artifactory instance that needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the collector using:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart otelcol-sumo
  ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chef">

import ChefNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/chef-without-env.md';

<ChefNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ansible">

import AnsibleNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/ansible-without-env.md';

<AnsibleNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Puppet">

import PuppetNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/puppet-without-env.md';

<PuppetNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


import LogsOutro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-outro.md';

## Viewing Linux - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics dashboards

import FilterDashboards from '../../../reuse/filter-dashboards.md';

<FilterDashboards/>

### Overview

The **Linux - Security Analytics - Overview** dashboard provides an overview of security statistics relevant for Linux systems and presents information about successful and failed logins, root login successes and failures, user accounts created and deleted, sudo attempts, and total services.

Use this dashboard to:

- Monitor administrative actions (create, delete users) performed by end users.
- Ensure proper services are running on all systems.
- Detect attempts to change the system time.
- Verify the status of critical systems.
- Monitor excessive failed login attempts and detect total number of attempts to break into the system.
