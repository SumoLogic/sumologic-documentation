The Cloud Security Monitoring & Analytics for Windows App offers pre-built dashboards and queries to help you track your Windows system, user accounts, login activity, and Windows updates.

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Windows - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics App.

## Log Types

The Windows - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics App uses Windows Security Event and System Event logs. It does not work with third-party logs.

### Sample Log Messages

```json
{
	"TimeCreated":"2020-10-12T07:31:14+000039800Z",
	"EventID":"1102",
	"Task":104,
	"Correlation":"",
	"Keywords":"Audit Success",
	"Channel":"Security",
	"Opcode":"Info",
	"Security":"",
	"Provider":{
		"Guid":"{fc65ddd8-d6ef-4962-83d5-6e5cfe9ce148}",
		"Name":"Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog"
	},
	"EventRecordID":101802,
	"Execution":{
		"ThreadID":2896,
		"ProcessID":908
	},
	"Version":0,
	"Computer":"WIN-6D5CO5AB123",
	"Level":"Informational",
	"EventData":{

	},
	"UserData":{
		"LogFileCleared":{
			"xmlns":"http://sz2016rose.ddns.net/win/2004/08/windows/eventlog",
			"SubjectUserName":"Administrator",
			"SubjectDomainName":"WIN-6D5CO5AB123",
			"SubjectLogonId":"0x1971888",
			"SubjectUserSid":"S-1-5-21-2020-10-12T07:31:14-203418232-2020-10-12T07:31:14-500"
		}
	},
	"Message":"The audit log was cleared.\r\nSubject:\r\n\tSecurity ID:\tWIN-6D5CO5AB123\\Administrator\r\n\tAccount Name:\tAdministrator\r\n\tDomain Name:\tWIN-6D5CO5AB123\r\n\tLogon ID:\t0x1971888"
}
```

### Sample Query

The sample query is from the **Recent Policy Changes** panel from **Windows - Overview** dashboard.

```sql
_sourceCategory=Labs/windows-jsonformat ( "Audit Policy Change" or "System audit policy was changed" or *policy*change* or "Policy Change" or 4902 or 4904 or 4905 or 4906 or 4907 or 4912 or 4715 or 4719 or 4739)
| json "EventID", "Computer", "Message" as event_id, host, msg_summary nodrop
| parse regex field = msg_summary "(?<msg_summary>.*\.*)"
| where (event_id in ("4902", "4904", "4905", "4906", "4907", "4912", "4715", "4719", "4739") or msg_summary matches "System audit policy was changed*") and host matches "*"
| count by msg_summary | sort by _count, msg_summary asc
```

## Collecting Logs for Windows Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics

### Configure a Collector and a Source

To configure a collector and source, do the following:

1. Configure an [Installed Windows collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows) through the user interface or from the command line.
2. Configure either a local or remote Windows Event Log source. To configure a Windows Event Log source set the following:
    * **Event Format.** Select **Collect using JSON format.** Events are formatted into JSON that is designed to work with Sumo Logic features, making it easier for you to reference your data.
    * **Event Collection Level.** When JSON format is selected you have to select Complete Message from the dropdown.

**Complete Message** will ingest the entire event content along with metadata.

For more information on local or remote Windows Event Log Source configuration, refer to [Local Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-event-log-source) and [Remote Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-event-log-source).


## Installing the Windows Cloud Security App

This section provides instructions for installing the Cloud Security Monitoring & Analytics for Windows App, along with examples of each of the App dashboards. The Cloud Security Monitoring & Analytics for Windows App offers pre-built dashboards and queries to help you track your Windows system, user accounts, login activity, and Windows updates.

Now that you have set up collection, install the Cloud Security Monitoring & Analytics for Windows App to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.  

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Windows Security Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).

### Security Monitoring - Inventory

**Windows - Security Monitoring - Inventory**: Utilize this dashboard to quickly assess system inventory and recent system reboots/restarts in order to understand device activity within your environment.

**Use case:** System inventory and system boots are leading indicators of potential security threats to be aware of, and that may require further attention.

### Security Monitoring - Critical Events

**Windows - Security Monitoring - Critical Events**: When audit logs are tampered, services are stopped, and ingestion delays go above ten seconds, these are all good indicators that there are action items to be taken to resolve issues within your Windows machines.

**Use case:** Evaluating unexpected critical events within Windows infrastructure allows for teams to stay on top of any necessary remedial steps.
