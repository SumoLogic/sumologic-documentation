The Sumo Logic app for Host and Process Metrics allows you to monitor the performance and resource utilization of hosts and processes that your mission critical applications are dependent upon. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into CPU, memory, network, file descriptors, page faults, and TCP connectors. This app uses Telegraf, an open-source, plugin-based collector for the collection of both host and process metrics data.

This app uses Telegraf and associated input plugins to collect both host and process metrics. To use the installed collector to collect and analyze host metrics, please see the [Host Metrics app](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics).

This app has been validated on Linux(Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS) and  Windows (Microsoft Windows Server 2019) and higher using Telegraf 1.18.2. This app is not recommended in Kubernetes environments; instead please use the [Kubernetes app](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes).


## Collecting metrics for Host and Processes

We use the Telegraf agent for Host and Process metrics collection. Telegraf runs on the same system and uses the input plugins to obtain host and process metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic.

The following input plugins are used by Sumo Logic

For Linux:
* [net](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/plugins/inputs/net/README.md)
* [Diskio](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/release-1.15/plugins/inputs/diskio)

### Configuring metrics collection

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Host and Process metrics. Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection for a given machine:

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[ Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Suggestions for setting your source category:
   * For identifying a specific cluster or a group of hosts: `<clustername>/metrics`
   * For identifying a group of hosts within a given deployment: `<environment name>/<clustername>/metrics`. Make a note of the HTTP Source URL and source category.
3. **Install Telegraf**. Use the [following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf on each host machine.
   * For [Windows](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md#install-telegraf-on-windows)
   * For [Ubuntu](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md#install-telegraf-on-ubuntu-or-debian-with-apt-get)
4. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the input plugins (described earlier) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.
   * Create or modify telegraf.conf (in linux it’s located in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/` and on Windows, it’s located in `C:\Program Files\InfluxData\Telegraf\`). Copy and paste the inputs, outputs and processors section  from one of the below files.
      * for Linux - [linux_sample_telegraf.conf](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/host_process_metrics/host_process_metrics_linux_sample.conf)
      * for Windows: [windows_sample_telegraf.conf](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/host_process_metrics/host_process_metrics_windows_sample.conf)
   * Enter values for the following parameters (marked with `CHANGE_ME`) in the downloaded file:
      * In the output plugins section which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
        * URL - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
        * **Do not modify** the following values set by this Telegraf configuration as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
           * data_format = “carbon2” In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`, This indicates that metrics should be sent in the carbon2 format to Sumo Logic.
        * For other optional parameters refer to [the respective plugin](#input-plugins)documentation for configuring the input plugins for Telegraf.
        * For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#agent) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, host and process metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

See Telegraf’s [Metric filtering capabilities](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#metric-filtering) to exclude metrics that you do not need from being sent to Sumo Logic.


### Monitoring processes with certain pattern

**exe**. Selects the processes that have process names that match the string that you specify

**pattern**. Selects the processes that have command lines (including parameters and options used with the command) matching the specified string using regular expression matching rules.

#### For Linux

On Linux servers, the strings that you specify in an exe or pattern section are evaluated as regular expressions.

Example: For filtering executable name containing nginx (i.e., `pgrep <exe>`)

```sql
[[inputs.procstat]]
    pid_tag=false
    exe = "nginx"
```


Example: For filtering command lines containing config (i.e., `pgrep -f <pattern>`)

```sql
[[inputs.procstat]]
    pid_tag=false
        pattern = "config"
```

#### For Windows

On servers running Windows Server, these strings are evaluated as WMI queries. (Ex `pattern: "%apache%"`). For more information, see [LIKE Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/like-operator).

Example: For filtering executable name containing nginx.

```sql
[[inputs.procstat]]
    pid_finder = "native"
    pid_tag=false
    exe = "%nginx%"
```

Example: For filtering command lines containing config.

```sql
[[inputs.procstat]]
    pid_finder = "native"
    pid_tag=false
    pattern = "%config%"
```

Example: For defining multiple patterns for multiple processes you can use the plugin multiple times.

```sql
[[inputs.procstat]]
   pid_tag=false
   exe = "nginx"

[[inputs.procstat]]
   exe = "tomcat"
   pid_tag=false
```

### Troubleshooting

* To identify the operating system version and name.
   * For Windows machines, run the command in Powershell to get the OS Version.
     ```sql
     [System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version
       (Get-WmiObject -class Win32_OperatingSystem).Caption
     ```
   * For Linux, run below command in terminal.
     ```bash
     uname -a
         lsb_release -a
     ```
*  To enable debug logs, set `“debug = true”` flag in telegraf.conf and run the command, it will output error in stdout.
   ```bash
   telegraf --config telegraf.conf --test
   ```
* If the telegraf conf changes are not reflecting, make sure to restart Telegraf using the command
    * Windows: `./telegraf.exe --service restart`
    * Linux: `sudo service telegraf restart`
* If certain metrics are not coming you may have to run the telegraf agent as root. Check [the respective plugin](#input+plugins) documentation for more information.

## Sample queries

**CPU Utilization by Host** panel in **Host Metrics - CPU** Dashboard

```sql
host.name=*  cpu=cpu-total  metric=(host_cpu_usage_user OR host_cpu_usage_system OR host_cpu_usage_iowait OR host_cpu_usage_steal OR host_cpu_usage_softirq OR host_cpu_usage_irq OR host_cpu_usage_nice) | sum by host.name
```

**CPU Usage** panel in **Process Metrics Details** Dashboard

```sql
metric=procstat_cpu_usage host.name=*  process.executable.name=* | avg by host.name, process.executable.name | outlier
```

## Installing the Alerts

The next few sections provide instructions for installing the Sumo app and Alerts for hosts and processes. These instructions assume you have already set up a collection as described in Collecting Metrics for Host and Processes.

Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you monitor your hosts and processes. These alerts are built based on metrics and logs datasets and include preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations.

For details on the individual alerts, see [last section](#host-and-process-metrics-alerts).

* To install these alerts, you need to have the Manage Monitors role capability.
* Alerts can be installed by either importing them a JSON or a Terraform script.

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled - please see the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts/monitors/monitor-faq.md) for details.


### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/host_process_metrics/host_process_metrics.json) describing all the monitors.<br/>The JSON contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all hosts, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections. However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific hosts or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `$$hostmetrics_data_source` with `<your sourceCategory>`. SourceCategory examples:
   * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster of hosts, your custom filter could be: `'_sourceCategory=yourclustername/metrics'`.
   * For alerts applicable to all hosts that start with ec2hosts-prod, your custom filter could be: `'_sourceCategory=ec2hosts-prod*/metrics'`.
   * For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter could be: `'_sourceCategory=prod/yourclustername/metrics'`
2. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
3. Click Add.
4. Click Import to import monitors from the JSON above.

The monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts using this method, navigate to the Host and Process Metrics folder under Monitors to configure them. See [this](/docs/alerts/monitors) document to enable monitors, to configure each monitor, to send notifications to teams or connections please see the instructions detailed in [Alert Configuration](#Alert_Configuration) of this [document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. **Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID**. Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the Manage Monitors role capability in Sumo Logic using [these instructions](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#manage-your-access-keys-on-preferences-page). Please identify which deployment your Sumo Logic account is in, using [this link](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
1. [Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later.
1. **Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Host and Process alerts**. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/postgresql). You can either download it through the “git clone” command or as a zip file.
1. **Alert Configuration**. After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/host_process_metrics/`. Edit the `host_and_processes.auto.tfvars` file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id, and Deployment from Step 1.
   ```bash
   access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
   access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
   environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
   ```
   Update the variable `host_and_processes_data_source` with your source category. SourceCategory examples:
    * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster of hosts, your custom filter could be: `_sourceCategory=yourclustername/metrics`.
    * For alerts applicable to all hosts that start with ec2hosts-prod, your custom filter could be:`_sourceCategory=ec2hosts-prod*/metrics`.
    * For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter could be: `_sourceCategory=prod/yourclustername/metrics`.
1. All monitors are disabled by default on installation. If you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter `monitors_disabled` to false in this file.
1. By default, the monitors are configured in a monitor folder called “Host and “Process Metrics”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in this file.
1. **Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples**. If you would like the alerts to send email or connection notifications, configure these in the file `host_process_metrics_notifications.auto.tfvars`.
   * To configure notifications, modify the file `host_process_metrics_notifications.auto.tfvars` file and fill in the `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` sections. See the examples for PagerDuty and email notifications below. See this [document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections) for creating payloads with other connection types. Replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).
   ```sql title="Pagerduty Connection Example:"
   connection_notifications = [
       {
         connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
         connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
         payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       },
       {
         connection_type       = "Webhook",
         connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
         payload_override      = "",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       }
     ]
   ```

   ```sql title="Email Notifications Example"
   email_notifications = [
       {
         connection_type       = "Email",
         recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
         subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
         time_zone             = "PST",
         message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       }
     ]
   ```
1. Install the Alerts.
   1. Navigate to the package directory `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/host_process_metrics/` and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
   2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors which will be created/modified by Terraform.
   3. Run `terraform apply`.


#### Post Installation

If you haven’t enabled alerts or configured notifications through the Terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other people or services. This is detailed in Step 4 of [this document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).
