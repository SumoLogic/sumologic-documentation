The Sumo Logic app for Windows allows you to monitor the performance and resource utilization of hosts and processes that your mission-critical applications are dependent upon. In addition to that, our Windows app provides insight into your Windows system's operation and events so that you can better manage and maintain your environment.

The Windows app, which is based on the Windows event log format, consists of predefined searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage of Security Status, System Activity, Updates, User Activity, and applications. Our dashboards provide insight into CPU, memory, network, file descriptors, page faults, and TCP connectors.

* Windows event logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [Event Log receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/windowseventlogreceiver).
* Windows Host metrics are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [Host Metrics receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver).

## Fields Created in Sumo Logic for Windows

Following are the [fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of Windows app install if not already present. 

- **`sumo.datasource`**. Has a fixed value of **windows**.

## Log types

The Windows app assumes events are coming from Windows Event Log receiver in JSON format. It does not work with third party logs.

Standard Windows event channels include:

- Security
- System
- application

## Collection configuration and app installation
:::note
You can skip this section if you have already set up the logs collection through [Windows PCI](/docs/integrations/pci-compliance/opentelemetry/windows-json-opentelemetry), [Windows - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics](/docs/integrations/cloud-security-monitoring-analytics/opentelemetry/windows-opentelemetry), or [Active Directory](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/opentelemetry/active-directory-json-opentelemetry) app installation. Additional collection is not required as the logs used by this app are already ingested into Sumo Logic.

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Windows-OpenTelemetry/Windows-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml file required for Windows event logs and metrics Collection.

Any custom fields can be tagged along with the data in this step.

#### Enable process metric collection (Optional)

import ProcMetrics from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/process-metric-collection.md';

<ProcMetrics/>

Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/Windows-YAML.png')} alt="Windows-YAML" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

<LogsIntro/>

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Windows">

1. Copy the yaml file to `C:\ProgramData\Sumo Logic\OpenTelemetry Collector\config\conf.d` folder in the machine that needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the collector using:
  ```sh
  Restart-Service -Name OtelcolSumo
  ```
