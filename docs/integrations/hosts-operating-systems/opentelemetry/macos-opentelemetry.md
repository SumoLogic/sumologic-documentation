The Sumo Logic App for macOS allows you to monitor the performance and resource utilization of hosts and processes that your mission-critical applications are dependent upon.

The app consists of predefined searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis. Our dashboards provide insight into CPU load, memory, network, file descriptors, page faults, and TCP connectors. This app uses OpenTelemetry, an open-source collector for metrics.

We use the Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics collection.

The OpenTelemetry collector runs on the macOS machine, and uses the [Host Metrics Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) to obtain host and process metrics, and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic.

## Fields Created in Sumo Logic for macOS

Following are the [fields](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of the macOS app install, if not already present. 

- **`sumo.datasource`** - Has fixed value of **mac**.

## Collection configuration and app installation

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md}

### Step 1: Set up Collector

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md}

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Mac-OpenTelemetry/Mac-Collector.png' alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for macOS Collection.

1. (Optional) You can add a custom tag, if desired. (There are no parameters required for the macOS app to install.)
2. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Mac-OpenTelemetry/Mac-YAML.png' alt="YAML" />

### Step 3: Send metrics to Sumo

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md}

1. Copy the yaml file to `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the macOS instance which needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the otelcol-sumo process using the below command 
  ```sh
  otelcol-sumo --config /etc/otelcol-sumo/sumologic.yaml --config "glob:/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/*.yaml"
  ```

{@import ../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-outro.md}

## Sample Queries

Metrics query from the File System Utilization panel.

```sh
sumo.datasource=mac host.name=* device=* metric=system.filesystem.utilization | sum by host.name, device, type, mountpoint
```

## Sample OTel Metrics

```json
{
	"queryId":"A",
	"_source":"sumo-mac-dc8d7942-8038-46f0-af33-9a3a06a73f72",
	"state":"LAST_ACK",
	"_sourceName":"sumomacsyslog",
	"host":"sumo-mac",
	"os.type":"darwin",
	"sumo.datasource":"mac",

## Viewing Linux Dashboards

### Host Metrics - Overview

The **Host Metrics - Overview** dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of the key metrics like CPU load, memory, network, and TCP connections of all your macOS hosts. 

Use this dashboard to:

- Identify hosts with high CPU load, memory utilization, and identify anomalies over time.

### Host Metrics - CPU

The **Host Metrics - CPU** dashboard provides the metric over time for CPU load.

Use this dashboard to:

- Identify hosts and processes with high CPU utilization.

### Host Metrics - Disk

The **Host Metrics - Disk** dashboard provides detailed information about file system metrics.

Use this dashboard to view:

- File system utilization over time.
- Devices by file system usage.
- Disk used by host.

### Host Metrics - Memory

The **Host Metrics - Memory** dashboard provides detailed information on host memory usage, memory distribution, and used free and Inactive memory.

Use this dashboard to:

- Identify hosts with high memory utilization.
- Examine memory distribution (free, used) for a given host.
- Total free used and inactive memory.

### Host Metrics - Network

The **Host Metrics - Network** dashboard provides detailed information on host network errors, throughput, and packets sent and received.

Use this dashboard to:

- Determine top hosts with network errors and dropped packets.
- Monitor abnormal spikes in incoming/outgoing packets and bytes sent and received.
- Use dashboard filters to compare throughput across the interface of a host.

### Host Metrics - TCP

The **Host Metrics - TCP** dashboard provides detailed information about inbound, outbound, open, and established TCP connections.

Use this dashboard to:

- Identify abnormal spikes in inbound, outbound, open, or established connections.
