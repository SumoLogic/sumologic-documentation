The Sumo Logic app for Linux allows you to monitor the performance and resource utilization of hosts and processes that your mission-critical applications are dependent upon. In addition to that, it allows you to view information about events, logins, and the security status of your Linux system using Linux system logs.

The app consists of predefined searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis. Our dashboards provide insight into CPU, memory, network, file descriptors, page faults, and TCP connectors. This app uses OpenTelemetry, an open-source collector for the collection of both metrics and log data.

We use the Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector to collect Linux metrics and system logs. The OpenTelemetry collector runs on the Linux machine and uses the [Host Metric Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver) to obtain Host and process metrics, and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Linux logs are sent to Sumo Logic through a [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields Created in Sumo Logic for Linux

Following are the [fields](/docs/manage/fields) that will be created as part of Linux app install if not already present. 

### Across apps

- **`sumo.datasource`** - has a fixed value of **linux**.

## Collection configuration and app installation

:::note
You can skip this section if you have already set up the logs collection through [Linux PCI](/docs/integrations/pci-compliance/opentelemetry/linux-opentelemetry) or [Linux - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics](/docs/integrations/cloud-security-monitoring-analytics/opentelemetry/linux-opentelemetry) app installation. Additional collection is not required as the logs used by this app are already ingested into Sumo Logic.
:::

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Linux-OpenTelemetry/Linux-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid black'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml file required for Linux Collection. The app requires path for system log file, based on your Linux version used.

#### Required Logs for Ubuntu

The following logs, located in your Linux machine's `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo app for Linux with Ubuntu:

- `auth.log`
- `syslog`
- `daemon.log`
- `dpkg.log`
- `kern.log`

#### Required Logs for CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat

The following logs, located in your Linux machine's `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo app for Linux with CentOS, Amazon Linux, and most Red Hat forks:

- `audit/audit.log`
- `secure`
- `Messages`
- `yum.log`

:::note
By default, the path for Linux log files required for all the distros are pre-populated in the UI. Not all of the files might be available on your Linux distribution. Optionally, you can remove unwanted file paths from the list. OpenTelemetry collection will still work properly even if not all of the files are present on your system. If in doubt, you can leave the default file paths values.
:::

#### Enable process metric collection (Optional)

import ProcMetrics from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/process-metric-collection.md';

<ProcMetrics/>

Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/Linux-YAML.png')} alt="Linux-YAML" style={{border:'1px solid black'}} width="800"/>

### Step 3: Send logs and metrics to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

<LogsIntro/>

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Copy the yaml file to `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Artifactory instance that needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the collector using:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart otelcol-sumo
  ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chef">

import ChefNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/chef-without-env.md';

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ansible">

import AnsibleNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/ansible-without-env.md';
