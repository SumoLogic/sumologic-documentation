The Sumo app for Linux allows you to view information about events, logins, and the security status of your Linux system. The app consists of predefined searches and three dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis.

## Collecting Logs for Linux

This procedure describes how to collect logs from Linux into Sumo Logic.

Sumo apps gather data from the log messages collected from sources by collectors. The Sumo app for Linux requires specific Linux log types, which are set up during the collector and source configuration process.

### Required Logs for Ubuntu

The following logs, located in your Linux machine's `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo app for Linux with Ubuntu:
* auth.log
* syslog
* daemon.log
* dpkg.log
* kern.log


### Required Logs for CentOS, Amazon Linux, and Red Hat

The following logs, located in your Linux machine's `/var/log` folder, are required for using the Sumo app for Linux with  CentOS, Amazon Linux, and most Red Hat forks:
* audit/audit.log
* secure
* messages
* yum.log


### Configure a Collector

Configure an [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).


### Configure a Source

To configure a source for collecting Linux logs, you create a Local File Source. Following the instructions on [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source). When you define a Source Category for the source, we recommend something like: prod/os/linux. For more information about Source Categories, see see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).

### Sample Log Messages

```bash
Dec 16 20:26:23 ubuntu sshd[15533]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=116.31.116.50  user=root

2016-12-16 19:23:13 startup packages remove

2016-12-16 19:23:13 remove tomcat7:all 7.0.68-1ubuntu0.1 <none>
```

### Sample Queries

See [Suggested Searches for Linux OS](#Suggested_Searches_for_Linux_OS).


## Installing the Linux App

Now that you have set up collection for Linux, install the Sumo Logic App for Linux to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards to analyze your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Linux Dashboards

### Overview

**Dashboard description:** See an overview of Linux activity, including the distribution of system events across hosts, group assignment changes, a breakdown of successful and failed logins, sudo attempts, and the count of reporting hosts.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/Overview.png')} alt="Linux dashboards" />


#### Filtering the Overview dashboard

Click the funnel icon in the upper left of the dashboard to display filtering options. You can filter the dashboard by any combination of `command`, `dest_group`, `dest_hostname`, and `dest_user`.


### Event Sources

**Dashboard description:** See information about system events, including their distribution across hosts, event counts per host by hour, and even counts by host and service.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/EventSources.png')} alt="Linux dashboards" />

#### Filtering the Event Sources dashboard

Click the funnel icon in the upper left of the dashboard to display filtering options. You can filter the dashboard by any combination of `dest_hostname`, `host`, and `process_name`.


### Login Status

**Dashboard description: **See information about logins to Linux hosts; including logins by hour; failed logins per host; the top 30 successful and failed logins; and the top 30 successful and failed remote logins.  

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/LoginStatus.png')} alt="Linux dashboards" />

#### Filtering the Login Status dashboard

Click the funnel icon in the upper left of the dashboard to display filtering options. You can filter the dashboard by any combination of `action`, `dest_hostname`, `dest_user`, and `outcome`.


### Security Status

**Dashboard description: **See information about security on Linux hosts, including su, sudo attempts, new and existing user assignments, package operations, and system start events.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/SecurityStatus.png')} alt="Linux dashboards" />

#### Filtering the Security Status dashboard

Click the funnel icon in the upper left of the dashboard to display filtering options. You can filter the dashboard by any combination of `action`, `dest_hostname`, `dest_user`, and `outcome`.


## Suggested Searches for Linux OS

These suggested searches cover some of the most common scenarios for monitoring user activity and security activity on a Linux server. These searches work on RedHat, Debian, SuSe platforms, and their derivations (for example, CentOS, Ubuntu, OpenSuSe).

You can enter these queries into the Search box as a starting baseline, and then customize a query and time range for your system. Be sure to [save your search](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/save-search.md) queries if you plan to run them often.

It's assumed that common Linux OS logs are collected (for example: `/var/log/*`).

The `_sourceCategory` fields shown in these sample queries are based on the following Linux logs and their metadata:

* **Generic system log:** Typically named `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`
Meta field: `SourceCategory = OS/Linux/System`
* Authentication log: Typically named `/var/log/auth` or `/var/log/auth.log`
Meta field: `SourceCategory=OS/Linux/Security`

These logs might have also been collected by the Collector (if selected during its installation).


### User Activity

These searches are intended to help you understand how privileged and non-privileged users are authenticating to and using your Linux servers.


#### Successful User Login events

Returns all successful remote and local logins by a user. Suggested time range: -1 day.
