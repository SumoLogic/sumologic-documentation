This guide helps you set up Sumo Logic Collectors, install the PCI Compliance for application, and create dashboards from samples so you can begin monitoring your usage and determine if you are meeting Compliance benchmarks.


## Collect Logs for PCI Compliance for Linux

The PCI Compliance for Linux App works with your existing Linux logs to identify any compliance issues.

To collect Linux logs, you'll need:

* An [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors). Choose the one right for your host environment.
* A Linux [Source](/docs/send-data/Sources/installed-collectors), depending on your environment.
    * [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/Sources/installed-collectors/Local-File-Source)
    * [Remote File Source](/docs/send-data/Sources/installed-collectors/Remote-File-Source)
    * [Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/Sources/installed-collectors/Syslog-Source)


## Installing the PCI Compliance for Linux App

Now that you have set up collection, install the Sumo Logic App for PCI Compliance for Linux to use the preconfigured searches and [dashboards](#viewing-dashboards) that provide insight into your data.

To install the app:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library.](/docs/get-started/library/install-apps)
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`). 
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
