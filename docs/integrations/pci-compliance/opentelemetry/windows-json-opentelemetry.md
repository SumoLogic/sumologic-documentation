The PCI Compliance for Windows JSON - OpenTelemetry is a log app that sends Windows log data to Sumo Logic via OpenTelemetry [windows event log receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/windowseventlogreceiver#readme). The app's preconfigured dashboards help you to monitor system, account, and user activity to ensure that login activity and privileged users are within the expected ranges.

:::info
The PCI Compliance for Windows JSON app covers PCI requirements 02, 06, 08, and 10.

## Fields created in Sumo Logic for PCI Compliance Windows JSON App

Following tags will be created as part of PCI Compliance Windows JSON app installation, if not already present.

- `sumo.datasource`: has the fixed value of **windows**.
- `host.group`: user configured tag which signifies a group of hosts for the operating system.
- `deployment.environment`: user configured tag which identifies the environment where the windows system resides. For example: dev, prod or qa.

## Log Types

The Windows App assumes events are coming from Windows Event Log receiver in JSON format. It does not work with third party logs.

Standard Windows event channels include:

- Security
- System

## Collection configuration and app installation

:::note
You can skip this section if you have already set up the logs collection through [Windows](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/opentelemetry/windows-opentelemetry/). Additional collection is not required as the logs used by this app are already ingested into Sumo Logic.
:::

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

:::note
If you want to use an existing OpenTelemetry Collector, you can skip this step by selecting the **Use an existing Collector** option.
:::

To create a new Collector:
1. Select the **Add a new Collector** option.
2. Select the platform where you want to install the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector.

This will generate a command that you can execute in the machine environment you need to monitor. Once executed, it will install the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml file required for Windows event logs collection.

Any custom fields can be tagged along with the data in this step.

Once the details are filled in, click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

<LogsIntro/>

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Windows">

1. Copy the yaml file to `C:\ProgramData\Sumo Logic\OpenTelemetry Collector\config\conf.d` folder in the machine which needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the collector using:
  ```sh
  Restart-Service -Name OtelcolSumo
  ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chef">

import ChefNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/chef-without-env.md';

<ChefNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ansible">

import AnsibleNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/ansible-without-env.md';

<AnsibleNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Puppet">

import PuppetNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/puppet-without-env.md';

<PuppetNoEnv/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import LogsOutro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-outro.md';
