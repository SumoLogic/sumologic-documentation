## Collect Logs for PCI Compliance for Palo Alto Networks 10

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic app for PCI Compliance for Palo Alto Networks 10, as well as sample log messages and a query example from an app dashboard. This includes the following tasks:

1. Create a hosted collector with a Cloud Syslog source
2. Define the destination for the logs.
3. Configure syslog forwarding
4. Verify logs in Palo Alto Networks

### Step 1. Create a hosted collector and Cloud Syslog source

In this step you configure a hosted collector with a Cloud Syslog source that will act as Syslog server to receive logs and events from Palo Alto Networks devices.

To configure a hosted collector with a Cloud Syslog source, do the following:

1. Log in to Sumo Logic and [create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector.md).
2. Create a [Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source) on the hosted collector, specifying the following:
    1. Enter a Source Name.
    2. Provide a Source Category: **NW/PAN/V10**
3. Click **Save**.
4. Copy the Token, host URL and TCP TLS Port to a safe place. You will need this information in the tasks that follow.

### Step 2. Define the destination for the logs

In this step you create a server profile where you can define the log destination. This will be the host name, port and protocol (TLS) of the Sumo Logic Cloud Syslog source.

To create a server profile specifying  the log destination, do the following:

1.  Login to the Palo Alto Networks Web interface as an administrative user.
2. Select **Device tab > Server Profiles > Syslog**.
3. Click **Add** at the bottom of the screen and provide endpoint details and a profile name, such as Sumo_Logs_Profile01.
4. In the **Syslog Server Profile** window, select the **Servers** tab and click **Add**.
5. In the **Servers** window, specify the following information:
    1. **Name.** Sumo_CloudSyslog_EndPoint01
    2. **Syslog Server.** URL from [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source)
    3. **Transport**. SSL
    4. **Port**. Port from [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source)
    5. **Format**. IETF
    6. **Facility.** LOG_USER
6. In the **Syslog Server Profile** window, select the **Custom Log Format** tab, and use the following custom format for the [Traffic](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/traffic-log-fields.html) log type:
```
,$receive_time,$serial,$type,$subtype,,$time_generated,$src,$dst,$natsrc,$natdst,$rule,$srcuser,$dstuser,$app,$vsys,$from,$to,$inbound_if,$outbound_if,$logset,,$sessionid,$repeatcnt,$sport,$dport,$natsport,$natdport,$flags,$proto,$action,$bytes,$bytes_sent,$bytes_received,$packets,$start,$sec,$category,,$seqno,$actionflags,$srcloc,$dstloc,,$pkts_sent,$pkts_received,$session_end_reason,$dg_hier_level_1,$dg_hier_level_2,$dg_hier_level_3,$dg_hier_level_4,$vsys_name,$device_name,$action_source,$src_uuid,$dst_uuid,$tunnelid/$imsi,$monitortag/$imei,$parent_session_id,$parent_start_time,$tunnel,$assoc_id,$chunks,$chunks_sent,$chunks_received,$rule_uuid,$http2_connection <Token from [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source)>
```
7. Click OK.
8. Commit the changes.

### Step 3. Configure syslog forwarding

To configure syslog forwarding for each Traffic logs, follow the steps to [Configure Log Forwarding](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/8-1/pan-os-admin/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding) as described in the Palo Networks documentation.

### Step 4. Verify logs in Palo Alto Networks

In this step, you view logs using the Palo Alto Network Web interface to confirm the logs are generated on the firewall.

To verify the logs in Palo Alto Networks, do the following:

1. In the Palo Alto Networks UI, select **Monitor** > **Logs**.
2. Once the setup is done, log in to Sumo Logic.
3. To validate that the logs are flowing to Sumo Logic, run a query using the source category you configured during [Step 1](#Step_1._Create_a_hosted_collector_and_Cloud_Syslog_source), such as:
`_sourceCategory = NW/PAN/V10`

### Sample log messages

The PCI Compliance for Palo Alto Networks 10 App uses [Traffic](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/traffic-log-fields.html) logs.

### PCI Req 01 - Accepted and Rejected Traffic

**Dashboard description:** See analytics about accepted and rejected firewall traffic, including information about traffic direction; allowed, denied, and silently dropped traffic over time; and the top source and destination IPs for allowed and rejected traffic.

**Use case:** You can use this dashboard to monitor allowed and rejected traffic in accordance with PCI requirement 1. The dashboard helps you identify systems accepting or rejecting traffic, and identify inbound and outbound network connections trends.

### PCI Req 01 - Traffic Direction Monitoring

**Dashboard description:** View information about inbound and outbound traffic, including traffic to the cardholder data environment (CDE); details of inbound and outbound traffic; the top 10 hosts sending traffic; and the top 10 hosts receiving traffic.

**Use case:** You can use this dashboard to monitor connections made from external IPs to internal IPs. You can identify top internal IPs receiving traffic from external IPs or sending traffic to external IPs. Similarly, this dashboard helps you identify the amount of traffic generated by different IPs crossing your organization's network boundary.

### PCI Req 01, 02 - Data Access Monitoring

**Dashboard description:** See information about accepted network traffic by application; top TCP and UDP source and destination ports; multi-services detected on the same host; and information about possible port scan attacks, both allowed and rejected.

**Use case:** You can use this dashboard to monitor activities on ports, apps being used, and the protocols used to access apps. The panels help you identify possible port scan attacks, both horizontal and vertical. You can also identify if there are systems on which multiple services are executing.

### PCI Req 02, 04 - Insecure Data In Transit

**Dashboard description:** See analytics about insecure data in transit data, including data transmissions to or from the cardholder data environment (CDE) using an insecure protocol; breakdowns of which apps, hosts, and ports were involved with insecure traffic.   

**Use case:** You can use this dashboard to identify systems and hosts involved in insecure data transit. You can identify insecure connections and port protocols like ftp, telnet, http, rlogin, and so on. You can also identify successful and rejected network connections for insecure connections.
