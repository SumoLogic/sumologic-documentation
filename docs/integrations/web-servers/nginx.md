Nginx is a web server used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. The Sumo Logic app for Nginx helps you monitor activity in Nginx. The preconfigured dashboards provide information about site visitors, including the location of visitors, devices/operating systems, and browsers used, and information about server activity, including bots, observed, and error information.

This app is tested with the following Nginx versions:
* Kubernetes environments: Nginx version 1.21.4
* Non-Kubernetes environments: Nginx version 1.19.8

## Collecting logs for the Nginx app

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Nginx. The following tasks are required:

### Step 1: Configure fields in Sumo Logic

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:
* `component`
* `environment`
* `webserver_system`
* `webserver_farm`
* `pod`

Additionally, if you are using Nginx in the Kubernetes environment, the following additional fields will be created by default during the app installation process:
* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_webserver_system`
* `pod_labels_webserver_farm`

### Step 2: Configure Nginx Logs and Metrics Collection

Sumo Logic supports the collection of logs and metrics data from Nginx in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Please click on the appropriate links below based on the environment where your Nginx farms are hosted.

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Nginx in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/nginxk8s.png')} alt="Web servers" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Nginx. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment: i.e. Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the [Nginx input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx) to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes).

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Nginx metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about this[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). Follow the steps listed below to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment:

1. [Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf).
2. On your Nginx Pods, add the following annotations:
 ```sql
 annotations:
    telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9273"
    telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+

 [[inputs.nginx]]
   urls = ["http://IP_TO_BE_CHANGED/nginx_status"]
   response_timeout = "5s"

   [inputs.nginx.tags]
    environment="<env_TO_BE_CHANGED>"
    component="webserver"
    webserver_system="nginx"
    webserver_farm="<nginx_TO_BE_CHANGED>"--If you haven’t defined a farm in Nginx, then enter `default` for `webserver_farm`.
 ```

Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf Nginx Input plugin. Please refer[ to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the Nginx input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
    * In the input plugins section, that is `[[inputs.nginx]]`:
        * `urls` - An array of Nginx stub_status URI to gather stats. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Nginx servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx#nginx-input-plugin) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Nginx input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, `[inputs.nginx.tags]`
        * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Nginx farm identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `webserver_farm `- Enter a name to identify this Nginx farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.  

:::warning Do not modify these values

Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`. This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`. This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section, that is `[inputs.nginx.tags]`
        * `component: “webserver”`: This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `webserver_system: “nginx”`: This value identifies the webserver system.
:::

  For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

3. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Nginx logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **(Recommended Method) Add labels on your Nginx pods to capture logs from standard output.** Make sure that the logs from Nginx are sent to stdout. Follow the instructions below to capture Nginx logs from stdout on Kubernetes.
   1. Apply following labels to the Nginx pod.
    ```sql
    labels:
     environment="prod_CHANGEME"
     component="webserver"
     webserver_system="nginx"
     webserver_farm="<farm_CHANGEME>"
    ```
   2. Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGE_ME` above):
     * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Nginx farm identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example:- dev, prod, or QA. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `Webserver_farm` - Enter a name to identify this Nginx farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards. If you haven’t defined a farm in Nginx, then enter `default` for `webserver_farm`.

   :::warning Do not modify these values

   Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
   * `component “webserver”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
   * `webserver_system: “nginx”` - This value identifies the database system.
   :::

   For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

   3. The Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection will automatically capture the logs from stdout and will send the logs to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, [visit](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#collecting-metrics-and-logs-for-the-kubernetes-app) here.
   4. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
2. **(Optional) Collecting Nginx Logs from a Log File**. Follow the steps below to capture Nginx logs from a log file on Kubernetes.
   1. Determine the location of the Nginx log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the nginx.conf for your nginx farm along with the mounts on the Nginx pods.
   2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
   ```xml
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_nginx_log_file>/<Nginx_log_file_name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```sql
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```
   4. Make sure that the Nginx pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <nginx_pod_name>
    ```
   5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
   6. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
<br/>
**FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with `pod_labels`. To normalize these for our app to work, a Field Extraction Rule named **AppObservabilityNginxWebserverFER** is automatically created for Nginx Application Components.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

Sumo Logic uses the Telegraf operator for Nginx metric collection and the [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) for collecting Nginx logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Nginx collection in a non-Kubernetes environment.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/nginx-nonk8s.png')} alt="Web servers" />

Telegraf uses the[ Nginx input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx) to obtain Nginx metrics and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Nginx are collected by a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).

The process to set up collection for Nginx data is done through the following steps.

#### Configure Logs Collection

Nginx app supports the default access logs and error logs format.

1. **Configure logging in Nginx.** Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must configure the logging of errors and processed requests in NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. For instructions, refer to the following [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/)
2. **Configure an Installed Collector.** If you have not already done so, install and configure an installed collector for Windows by [following the documentation](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows).
3. **Configure a Collector** Use one of the following Sumo Logic Collector options:
    1. To collect logs directly from the Nginx machine, configure an [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
    2. If you're using a service like Fluentd, or you would like to upload your logs manually, [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
4. **Configure a local file source**. Choose a method:

<details>
<summary>For an Installed Collector</summary>

To collect logs directly from your Nginx machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.  

1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
   * **Name**. (Required)
   * **Description**. (Optional)
   * **File Path (Required)**. Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in /var/log/nginx/error.log. If you're using a customized path, check the **nginx.conf** file for this information. If you're using Passenger, you may have instructed Passenger to log to a specific log using the passenger_log_file option.
   * **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
   * **Source Category**. Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as Nginx/Access or Nginx/Error. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
   * **Fields.** Add the following fields, as shown in the screenshot below.
    ```bash
    component = webserver
    webserver_system = nginx
    webserver_farm = <Your_nginx_farm_Name> #Use Default if you do not have one.
    environment = <Your_Environment_Name> #i.e., Dev, QA, or Prod
    ```
3. Configure the Advanced section:
    * Enable Timestamp Parsing. Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
    * Time Zone. Automatically detect.
    * Timestamp Format. The timestamp format is automatically detected.
    * Encoding. Select UTF-8 (Default).
    * Enable Multiline Processing.
        * Error logs. Select Detect messages spanning multiple lines and Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically.
        * Access logs. These are single-line logs, uncheck Detect messages spanning multiple lines.
4. Click Save.

</details>

<details>
<summary>For a Hosted Collector</summary>

If you're using a service like Fluentd, or you would like to upload your logs manually, use a Hosted Collector and an HTTP Source.

1. Add an [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).
2. Configure the HTTP Source fields as follows:
    * **Name**. (Required)
    * **Description**. (Optional)
    * **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
    * **Source Category**. Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as Nginx/Access or Nginx/Error. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    * **Time Zone**. For Access logs, use the time zone from the log file. For Error logs, make sure to select the correct time zone.
    * **Timestamp Format**. The timestamp format is automatically detected.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing**.
        * **Error logs**: Select **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** and **Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically**.
        * **Access logs**: These are single-line logs, uncheck **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**.
4. Click **Save**.
5. When the URL associated with the HTTP Source is displayed, copy the URL so you can add it to the service you are using, such as Fluentd.

</details>

#### Configure Metrics Collection

#### Set up a Sumo Logic HTTP Source

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector for Metrics.** To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs & Metrics source**:
    1. On the created Hosted Collector on the Collection Management screen, select **Add Source**.
    2. Select **HTTP Logs & Metrics.**
        1. **Name.** (Required). Enter a name for the source.
        2. **Description.** (Optional).
    3. **Source Category** (Recommended). Be sure to follow the [Best Practices for Source Categories](/docs/send-data/best-practices). A recommended Source Category may be Prod/Webserver/Nginx/Metrics.
3. Select **Save**.
4. Take note of the URL provided once you click _Save_. You can retrieve it again by selecting the **Show URL** next to the source on the Collection Management screen.


#### Set up Telegraf

1. **Install Telegraf if you haven’t already.** Use the [following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
2. **Configure and start Telegraf.**
3. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [nginx input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.

Create or modify `telegraf.conf` and copy and paste the text below:  
```sql
[[inputs.nginx]]
  urls = ["http://IP_TO_BE_CHANGED/nginx_status"]
  response_timeout = "5s"

  [inputs.nginx.tags]
    environment="env_TO_BE_CHANGED"
    component="webserver"
    webserver_system="nginx"
    webserver_farm="<nginx_TO_BE_CHANGED>"

[[outputs.sumologic]]
  url = "<URL_from_HTTP_Logs_and_Metrics_Source>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```

Enter values for fields annotated with `<VALUE_TO_BE_CHANGED>` to the appropriate values. Do not include the brackets (`< >`) in your final configuration

* Input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.nginx]]`:
    * `urls` - An array of Nginx stub_status URI to gather stats. For more information on additional parameters to configure the Nginx input plugin for Telegraf see[ this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx#nginx-input-plugin).
* In the tags section, which is `[inputs.nginx.tags]`:
    * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Nginx farm identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example; dev, prod, or QA. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
    * `webserver_farm` - Enter a name to identify this Nginx farm. This farm name will be shown in our dashboards.
* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
    * **`URL`** - This is the HTTP source URL created previously. See this doc for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this Telegraf configuration.

If you haven’t defined a farm in Nginx, then enter `default` for `webserver_farm`.

There are additional values set by the Telegraf configuration. We recommend not to modify these values as they might cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.

* `data_format: “prometheus”`. In the output `[[outputs.sumologic]]` plugins section. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic.
* `Component - “webserver”` - In the input `[[inputs.nginx]]` plugins section. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `webserver_system - “nginx”` - In the input plugins sections. This value identifies the webserver system.

See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for all other parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

After you have finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from this[ doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Telegraf should start collecting the Nginx metrics and forward them to the Sumo Logic HTTP Source.

## Installing the Nginx app

This section demonstrates how to install the Nginx app.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the Nginx app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.  
   :::note
   Version selection is not available for all apps.
   :::
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    2. **Data Source.** Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom Nginx farm filter. Examples:
       1. For all Nginx farms, `webserver_farm=*`.
       2. For a specific farm, `webserver_farm=nginx.dev.01`.
       3. Farms within a specific environment, `webserver_farm=nginx.dev.01` and `environment=prod`. (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection).
3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

## Viewing Nginx Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables).

Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you quickly determine if the Nginx server is available and performing as expected. These alerts are built based on logs and metrics datasets and have preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations. They are as follows:

| Alert Type (Metrics/Logs) | Alert Name | Alert Description | Trigger Type (Critical / Warning) | Alert Condition | Recover Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Logs | Nginx - Access from Highly Malicious Sources | This alert fires when an Nginx server is accessed from highly malicious IP addresses. | Critical | > 0 | < = 0 |
| Logs | Nginx - High Client (HTTP 4xx) Error Rate | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (>5%) with a response status of 4xx. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Logs | Nginx - High Server (HTTP 5xx) Error Rate | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (>5%) with a response status of 5xx. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Logs | Nginx - Critical Error Messages | This alert fires when we detect critical error messages for a given Nginx server. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Metrics | Nginx - Dropped Connections | This alert fires when we detect dropped connections for a given Nginx server. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
