The Internet Information Services (IIS) 10 app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor your IIS web servers' availability, performance, health, and resource utilization. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide insight into application pools, ASP.NET applications, requests, latency, visitor locations, visitor access types, traffic patterns, errors, web server operations, and access from known malicious sources.

This app is tested with the following IIS versions:
* Internet Information Services (Version 10.0.17763.1)
* Internet Information Services (Version 8.5.9600.16384)

:::note
IIS app and integration are supported only on Windows.

## Collecting logs and metrics for the IIS app

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for IIS.

Sumo Logic supports the collection of logs and metrics data from the IIS server in standalone environments. The process to set up collection is done through the following steps:

1. [Configure Log Collection](#configure-log-collection)
    * Enable Logging on the IIS Server Side
    * Log Types
    * Set up Collector and Sources on the Sumo Logic side
        * Set up local file source for IIS Access Logs
        * Set up local file source for IIS Error Logs
        * Set up Source for IIS Performance (Perfmon) Logs
2. [Configure Metrics Collection](#configure-metrics-collection)
    * Configure HTTP Logs and Metrics Source
    * Configure a Hosted Collector
    * Install Telegraf
    * Configure Telegraf (telegraf.conf), and start it

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-flow.png')} alt="Collect Internet Information Services (IIS) Logs and Metrics for Standalone environments" />

Sumo Logic uses the Telegraf operator for IIS metric collection and the [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) for collecting IIS logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the IIS collection in a standalone environment. Telegraf uses the [Windows Performance Counters Input Plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) to obtain IIS metrics and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from the IIS Server are collected by a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).

### Configure log collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for IIS running on a standalone environment for the Sumo Logic app for IIS.

1. **Log Types**. This section covers the following default log formats for IIS 10 and IIS 8.5:
   * IIS Access Logs (W3C format)
   * HTTP Error Logs
   * Performance Logs

   Default log formats are used by IIS app. IIS allows you to choose which fields to log in IIS access logs. To understand the various fields and their significance, see [Microsoft | W3C Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/w3c-logging).

   IIS Log files are generated as local files. For a standard Windows Server, the default log location is as follows:
   ```bash
   %SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles
   #Example c:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\
   ```
   Within the folder, you will find subfolders for each site configured with IIS. The logs are stored in folders that follow a naming pattern like W3SVC1, W3SVC2, W3SVC3, etc. The number at the end of the folder name corresponds to your site ID. For example, W3SVC2 is for site ID 2.
   * **IIS Access Logs (W3C default format)**. Sumo Logic expects logs in W3C format with the following fields. IIS allows you to choose fields to log in to IIS access logs. To learn more about the various fields and their significance, see [Microsoft | W3C Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/w3c-logging).
     ```
     #Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
     ```
   * **HTTP Error Logs**. Sumo Logic expects Error logs in the following format. For information on how to configure HTTP Error Logs, and for explanations on the various HTTP Error Log fields and their significance, see [Microsoft | Error logging in HTTP APIs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/820729/error-logging-in-http-apis).
     ```
     #Fields: date time c-ip c-port s-ip s-port protocol_version verb cookedurl_query protocol_status siteId Reason_Phrase Queue_Name
     ```
   * **Performance Logs**. These logs are the output of Perfmon queries which will be configured at Installed Collector, "**Windows Performance**" Source.

### Enable logging on your IIS server

If logging is not already enabled on your IIS Server, perform the following steps to enable it:

1. Open IIS Manager.
1. Select the site or server in the **Connections** pane, then double-click **Logging**. Enhanced logging is only available for site-level logging. If you select the server in the Connections pane, then the Custom Fields section of the W3C Logging Fields dialog is disabled.
1. In the Format field under Log File, select **W3C** and then click Select Fields. IIS app works on default fields selection.
1. Select the following fields, if not already selected. Sumo Logic expects these fields in IIS logs for the IIS app to work by default:
    `date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken`

For more information about IIS log format and log configuration, see [Microsoft | Enhanced Logging for IIS 8.5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-85/enhanced-logging-for-iis85).

### Verify that log files are created

Perform the following tasks to ensure that log files are being created:

1. Open a command-line window and change directories to `C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles`. This is the same path you will enter when you configure the Source to collect these files.
1. Under the \W3SVC1 directory, you should see one or more files with a .log extension. If the file is present, you can collect it.

### Enable HTTP error logs on your Windows server

Perform the following task to enable HTTP Error Logs on your Windows Server that is hosting the IIS Server:

1. Configure HTTP Error Logging by following the [Microsoft | Configuring HTTP Server API Error Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/configuring-http-server-api-error-logging) documentation.
1. Format your HTTP Error Logs by following the [Microsoft | Format of the HTTP Server API Error Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/format-of-the-http-server-api-error-logs) documentation. HTTP Error Log files are generated as local files. The default HTTP Error log file location is:
   ```sh
   C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR
   ```

### Configure an installed collector

If you have not already done so, install and configure an installed collector for Windows by following the [Install a Collector on Windows](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows) documentation.

### Configure source for IIS Access logs

This section demonstrates how to configure a Local File Source for IIS Access Logs, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/web-servers/iis-10). You may configure a [Remote File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-file-source), but the configuration is more complex. Sumo Logic recommends using a Local File Source whenever possible. To configure a local file source for IIS Access Logs, do the following:

1. Configure a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Specify the Local File Source Fields as follows:
   1. **Name**. Required (for example, "IIS Access Logs")
   2. **Description**. (Optional)
   3. **File Path** (Required). `C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles\W3SVC*\*.log`
   4. **Collection start time**. Choose how far back you would like to begin collecting historical logs. For example, choose 7 days ago to begin collecting logs with the last modified date within the last seven days.
   5. **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the operating system by default, but you can enter a different hostname.
   6. **Source Category** (Required). For example, Webserver/IIS/Access.
   7. **Fields**. Set the following fields:
      * `component = webserver`
      * `webserver_system = iis`
      * `webserver_farm = <Your_IISserver_farm_Name>`. (Enter **Default** if you do not have one.)
      * `environment = <Your_Environment_Name>` (For example, Dev, QA, or Prod.)
3. Configure the Advanced section:
   * **Timestamp Parsing Settings**. Make sure the setting matches the timezone on the log files.
   * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
   * **Time Zone**. Select the option to **Use time zone from the log file. If none is present use:** and set the timezone to **UTC**.
   * **Timestamp Format**. Select the option to **Automatically detect the format**.
   * **Encoding**. UTF-8 is the default, but you can choose another encoding format from the menu if your IIS logs are encoded differently.
   * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Uncheck the box to **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**. Since IIS Access logs are single-line log files, disabling this option will ensure that your messages are collected correctly.
4. Click **Save**.

After a few minutes, your new Source should be propagated down to the Collector and will begin submitting your IIS Access log files to the Sumo Logic service.

### Configure source for HTTP error logs

This section demonstrates how to configure a Local File Source for HTTP Error Logs, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/web-servers/iis-10). To configure a local file source for HTTP Error Logs, do the following:

1. Configure a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Specify the Local File Source Fields as follows:
    1. **Name**. Required (for example, "HTTP Error Logs")
    2. **Description**. (Optional)
    3. **File Path** (Required). `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR\*.*`
    4. **Collection start time**. Choose how far back you would like to begin collecting historical logs. For example, choose 7 days ago to begin collecting logs with the last modified date within the last seven days.
    5. **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the operating system by default, but you can enter a different hostname.
    6. **Source Category** (Required). For example, Webserver/IIS/Error.
    7. **Fields**. Set the following fields:
       * `component = webserver`
       * `webserver_system = iis`
       * `webserver_farm = <Your_IISserver_farm_Name>`. (Enter **Default** if you do not have one.)
       * `environment = <Your_Environment_Name>` (For example, Dev, QA, or Prod)<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-http-logs.png')} alt="IIS-access-logs" width="500"/>
3. Configure the Advanced section settings:
    * **Timestamp Parsing Settings**. Make sure the setting matches the timezone on the log files.
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    * **Time Zone**. Select the option to **Use time zone from the log file. If none is present use:** and set the timezone to **UTC**.
    * **Timestamp Format**. Select the option to **Automatically detect the format**.
    * **Encoding**. UTF-8 is the default, but you can choose another encoding format from the menu if your IIS logs are encoded differently.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Uncheck the box to **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**. Since IIS Error logs are single-line log files, disabling this option will ensure that your messages are collected correctly.
4. Click **Save**.

After a few minutes, your new Source should be propagated down to the Collector and will begin submitting your IIS HTTP Error log files to the Sumo Logic service.

### Configure source for IIS Performance (Perfmon) logs

This section demonstrates how to configure a Windows Performance Source, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/web-servers/iis-10). Use the appropriate source for your environment:
* [Local Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-performance-monitor-log-source) (**recommended**)
* [Remote Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-performance-monitor-log-source)

To configure a Source for IIS Performance Logs, do the following:

1. Configure a [Local Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-performance-monitor-log-source).
2. Configure the Local Windows Performance Source Fields as follows:
    * **Name**. Required (for example, "IIS Performance")
    * **Source Category** (Required). For example, Webserver/IIS/PerfCounter.
    * **Frequency**. **Every Minute** (you may custom choose the frequency)
    * **Description**. (Optional)
    * **Fields**. Set the following fields:
       * `component = webserver`
       * `webserver_system = iis`
       * `webserver_farm = <Your_IISserver_farm_Name>`. (Enter **Default** if you do not have one.)
       * `environment = <Your_Environment_Name>` (for example, Dev, QA, or Prod)
3. Under Perfmon Queries, click **Add Query**.
4. Add the following two queries:
    * Query 1:
        1. For **Name**, enter **WebServices**.
        2. For **Query**, enter Select TotalMethodRequestsPerSec, GetRequestsPerSec, PostRequestsPerSec, CurrentConnections, CurrentAnonymousUsers, CurrentNonAnonymousUsers, CGIRequestsPerSec, ISAPIExtensionRequestsPerSec, BytesReceivedPerSec, BytesSentPerSec, FilesReceivedPerSec, FilesSentPerSec, ServiceUptime, BytesTotalPerSec from Win32_PerfFormattedData_W3SVC_WebService.
    * Query 2:
        1. For **Name**, enter **HTTPServiceRequestQueues**.
        2. For **Query**, enter Select ArrivalRate, CurrentQueueSize, CacheHitRate, RejectionRate, MaxQueueItemAge from Win32_PerfFormattedData_Counters_HTTPServiceRequestQueues.
5. Click **Save**.

### Configure metrics collection

### Set up a Sumo Logic HTTP source

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector for Metrics**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs & Metrics source**:
    1. On the created Hosted Collector on the Collection Management screen, select **Add Source**.
    2. Select **HTTP Logs & Metrics**.
        1. **Name**. (Required). Enter a name for the source.
        2. **Description**. (Optional).
        3. **Source Category** (Required). For example, `Prod/Webserver/IIS/Metrics`.
    3. Select **Save**.
    4. Take note of the URL provided once you click **Save**. You can retrieve it again by selecting the **Show URL** next to the source on the Collection Management screen.

### Set up Telegraf

1. **Install Telegraf if you haven’t already**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to install Telegraf.
2. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the[ Windows Performance Counters Input Plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.

  * Enter values for fields annotated with `<VALUE_TO_BE_CHANGED>` to the appropriate values. Do not include the brackets (`< >`) in your final configuration.
  * If you haven’t defined a farm in IIS Server, enter ‘**default**’ for `webserver_farm`.
  * In the Input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.win_perf_counters]]`:
    Configure the Windows Performance Counters Input Plugin for Telegraf see[ this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/win_perf_counters#windows-performance-counters-input-plugin).
  * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.win_perf_counters.tags]`:
     * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the IIS Server farm identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example; dev or QA. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `webserver_farm`. Enter a name to identify this IIS Server farm This farm name will be shown in our dashboards. Use “`default`” if none is present.
  * In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
     * `URL`. This is the HTTP source URL created previously. See this doc for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
  * If you haven’t defined a farm in the IIS Server, enter ‘**default**’ for `webserver_farm`.
  * There are additional values set by the Telegraf configuration. We strongly advise against changing these values as it might cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
     * `data_format: “prometheus”`. In the output `[[outputs.sumologic]]` plugins section. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic.
     * `component - “webserver”`. In the input `[[inputs.win_perf_counters]]` plugins section. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
     * `webserver_system - “iis”`. In the input plugins sections. This value identifies the webserver system.
  * See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for all other parameters that you can configure in the Telegraf agent globally.
3. After you have finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from this [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Telegraf should start collecting the IIS Server metrics and forward them to the Sumo Logic HTTP Source.

## Installing the IIS app

import AppInstall2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-sc-k8s.md';

<AppInstall2/>

The following fields will be created automatically as a part of the app installation process:
* `component`
* `environment`
* `webserver_system`
* `webserver_farm`
* `pod`

## Viewing IIS dashboards

import ViewDashboards from '../../reuse/apps/view-dashboards.md';

<ViewDashboards/>

### Overview

The **IIS - Overview** dashboard provides a high-level view of the performance and integrity of your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) infrastructure. Dashboard panels display visual graphs and detailed information on IIS versions, platforms, and log formats. Panels also show visitor geographic locations and top app requests. OS platforms, response status, response times, and client and server errors.

Use this dashboard to:
* Get a high-level overview of sites, requests, connect, cache, data received and sent, queue, application pool, client location, client platforms, errors, and threats identified.
* Drill Down to specific use cases by clicking on specific panels of interest.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-Overview.png')} alt="IIS-Overview" />

### HTTP Error

The **IIS - HTTP Error** dashboard provides detailed information on IIS error logging in HTTP. Dashboard panels show details on error events, top client and server IP addresses, top protocol versions, and protocol status. Panels also show information on top reason phrases and verbs associated with HTTP errors, as well as top request details by reason.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor errors logged by HTTP.SYS. The client request may be rejected by HTTP.SYS before it made it to an IIS worker process. In such cases, the error is logged in the HTTPERR logs.
* Identify the reason for failure. Check if the request violated the HTTP protocol, or if there was a WAS/the application pool failure.
* Correct the error identified to ensure a consistent and satisfactory user experience.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-HTTP-Error.png')} alt="IIS-HTTP-Error" />

### Performance Snapshot

The **IIS - Performance Snapshot** dashboard provides detailed information on your IIS infrastructure integrity and performance. Dashboard panels show details on Web Service uptime, active connections, requests, user activity, and total bytes transferred. Panels also provide HTTP Service Request Queues details, such as arrivals, queue size, cache hit rate, and rejection rate.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor incoming request traffic, along with queue size and rejection rate to identify any bottlenecks.
* Monitor cache hit rates to check how requests are being served. Typically static content has high cache hit rates.
* Monitor current active connections to track sudden rises in connections. A sudden rise results in increased resource requirements. A sudden rise may also indicate a security attack.
* Monitor the load on your site by looking into the rate of all the requests and rates based on specific types of HTTP methods, to anticipate resource needs and allocate them accordingly.
* Monitor Bytes/Files transferred, to check if there is a need to make page content more lightweight, or track the most typically transferred high data content. This can also be an indicator of a potential spike in traffic.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-Performance-Snapshot.png')} alt="IIS-Performance-Snapshot" />

### Performance Trends

The **IIS - Performance Trends** dashboard provides details on ISS infrastructure trends for requests, active connections, bytes received and sent, files received and sent, queue size, arrival rate, and cache hit rate.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor trends of various metrics to keep track of how requests are served over time and anticipate potential performance bottlenecks.
* Acquire current performance snapshots of IIS servers. You can drill down to the Performance Snapshot by clicking the Requests Per Sec (All methods) panel.
