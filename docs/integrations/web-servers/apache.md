The Apache app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health, and resource utilization of Apache web server farms. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis: visitor locations, visitor access types, traffic patterns, errors, web server operations, resource utilization, and access from known malicious sources.

## Log types and metrics
The Sumo Logic app for Apache assumes:
* The [NCSA extended/combined log file format ](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html) has been configured for Apache access logs and the default error log format for Apache Access logs and Apache Error logs. For a list of metrics that are collected and used by the app, see [Apache Metrics](#apache-metrics).

* The **Apache - Overview** dashboard is based on both Apache logs and metrics.
* Dashboards in the Metrics folder are based on Apache metrics alone.
* Dashboards and searches in the Logs folder are based on Apache access and error logs

## Collecting logs and metrics for Apache

Sumo Logic supports the collection of logs and metrics data from Apache in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Please click on the appropriate link below based on the environment where your Apache farms are hosted.

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"

    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture).The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Apache in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/Apache-flow.png')} alt="Apache" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Apache. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment, meaning, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors.

Telegraf uses the [Apache input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache) to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

:::note Prerequisites
Ensure that you are monitoring your Kubernetes clusters with the Telegraf operator. If you're not, see [these instructions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to do so.
:::

### Configure metrics collection

Follow the steps below to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment:

1. Add configuration to enable metrics on Apache pods:
```xml
configuration: |-
ServerName localhost:8080
  <IfModule status_module>
    ExtendedStatus On
    <Location /server-status>
      Sethandler server-status
      order deny,allow
      allow from all
    </Location>
  </IfModule>
```
2. Add annotations on your Apache pods:
```sql
annotations:
 telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/port: "9273"
  telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
    [[inputs.apache]]
    < urls = ["http://localhost:8080/server-status?auto"] >
      [inputs.apache.tags]
        environment = "<prod_CHANGE_ME>"
        component = "webserver"
        webserver_system = "apache"
        webserver_farm = "<app1apacheeks_CHANGE_ME>"
```
3. Enter in values for the parameters marked in brackets (`< >`) above.
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`: This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf Apache Input plugin. Please refer[ to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache) for more information on configuring the Apache input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
      * In the input plugins section:
         * `urls`: The URL to the Apache server
         * In the tags section  `[inputs.apache.tags]`
         * `environment`: This is the deployment environment where the Apache webserver farm identified by the value of `urls` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
         * `webserver_farm`: Enter a name to uniquely identify this Apache Webserver farm. This Apache webserver farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

   :::warning **Do not modify the following values**
   Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to function incorrectly.
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`: Instructs the Telegraf operator on what output to use.
   * `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`: Ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
   * `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`: Tells Prometheus what ports to scrape on.
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
      * In the tags section `[inputs.apache.tags]`
      * `component: “webserver”`: Used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
      * `webserver_system: “apache”`: Identifies the webserver system.
   :::     
   * For more information on other parameters and properties that you can configure in the Telegraf agent globally, see [Configuring_Telegraf](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf).
   * For more information on configuring the Apache input plugin for Telegraf, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache).
4. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the configuration and annotations defined in the previous step.
5. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic by running the following metrics query:
  ```sql
  webserver_farm=<your_apache_webserver_farmname> \
  component="webserver" and webserver_system="apache"
  ```

### Configure logs collection

This section explains the steps to collect Apache logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **Collect Apache logs written to standard output and standard error**. If your Apache helm chart/pod is writing the logs to standard output or standard error then follow the steps listed below to collect the logs:
   1. On your Apache pods, add the following pod labels:
   ```xml
   environment: "<prod_CHANGE_ME>"
   component: "webserver"
   webserver_system: "apache"
   webserver_farm: "<app1apacheeks_CHANGE_ME>"
   ```
   2. Enter in values for the parameters marked in brackets (`< >`) above.
      * `environment`: This is the deployment environment where the Apache webserver farm identified by the value of `urls` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
      * `webserver_farm`: Enter a name to identify this Apache webserver farm. This Apache webserver farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

   :::warning **Do not modify the following values**
   Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to function incorrectly
   * `component: “webserver”`: This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
   * `webserver_system: “apache”`: This value identifies the webserver system.
   :::
   * For all other parameters, please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
   3. Make sure that the Apache pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
   ```xml
   kubectl describe pod <apache_pod_name>
   ```
   The Sumo Logic Kubernetes Collection process will automatically capture the logs from `stdout`/`stderr` and will send the logs to Sumo Logic. For more information on deploying the Sumo Logic-Kubernetes-Collection, please see [this page](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#collecting-metrics-and-logs-for-the-kubernetes-app).
<br/>
**FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with `pod_labels`. To normalize these for our app to work, a Field Extraction Rule named **AppObservabilityApacheWebserverFER** is automatically created for Apache Web Server Application Components.

We use the Telegraf Operator for Apache metrics collection and the Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Apache logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Apache collection in a non-Kubernetes environment for each web server. Telegraf runs on the same host as Apache, and uses the [Apache input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache) to obtain Apache metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Apache logs are sent to a Sumo Logic Local File source of an installed collector.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/apache-non-k8s.png')} alt="apache-non-k8s" />

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Apache. Follow the instructions to set up metrics collection for each server belonging to a Apache server farm:

### Configure metrics collection from an Apache server

1. **Configure Metrics in Apache**. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest metrics, you must turn on [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html) for Apache. For this, edit the Apache conf file (httpd.conf).
   * Uncomment this line if not already done in the httpd.conf: `LoadModule status_module libexec/apache2/mod_status.so`
   * Add the following lines in the httpd.conf after that
    ```xml
    <IfModule status_module>
      ExtendedStatus On
     <Location /server-status>
        Sethandler server-status
        order deny,allow
        allow from localhost
      </Location>
    </IfModule>
    ```
   * You may need to update ServerName in the httpd.conf file. For example: `ServerName localhost:80`.
   * Save **httpd.conf** file
   * Verify configuration is working as expected by running the following command:
    ```bash
    apachectl configtest
    # Syntax OK
    ```        
   * Restart httpd
     ```bbsdh
     apachectl restart
     ```
    * To test, enter the following urls in the web-browser. You should see the standard Apache output.
       * [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
       * [http://localhost/server-status](http://localhost/server-status)
2. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[ Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
3. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following [these instructions.](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
4. **Install Telegraf**. Follow the steps in [this document](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
5. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Apache input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.
   1. Create or modify the telegraf.conf file and copy and paste the text below in the relevant sections:
      ```sql
      [[inputs.apache]]
        urls = ["http://localhost/server-status?auto"]
        response_timeout = "5s"
        [inputs.apache.tags]
          environment = "prod"
          component = "webserver"
          webserver_system = "apache"
          webserver_farm = "your_apache_webserver_farmname"

      [[outputs.sumologic]]
        url = "<URL Created in Step 3>"
        data_format = "prometheus"

      [agent]
        interval = "60s"
        flush_interval = "60s"
      ```
   2. Enter values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):
      * In the input plugins section:
         * `urls`: The URL to the Apache server. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Apache input plugin for Telegraf.
      * Configure metrics to collect by uncommenting the following lines. Please see [this document](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/apache#configuration) for more information
        * `response_timeout = "5s"`
      * In the tags section `[inputs.apache.tags]`
        * `webserver_farm`: Enter a name to uniquely identify this Apache web server farm. This web server farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
        * `environment`: This is the deployment environment where the Apache web server farm identified by the value of `urls` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
      * In the output plugins section:
        * `url`: This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
      * In the `[agent]` section, set `interval` and `flush_interval` to `“60s”` to collect metric every 60 seconds.

      :::warning **Do not modify the following values**
      Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to function incorrectly
      * `data_format = “prometheus”`, In the output plugins section, Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
      * `component = “webserver”`: In the input plugins section, This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
      * `webserver_system = “apache”`: In the input plugins section, This value identifies the webserver system.
      :::

   For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

   2. Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service via the instructions described in their [documentation](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Apache metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

### Configure logs collection from an Apache server
This section provides instructions for configuring a collection of logs from Apache running on a non-Kubernetes environment.

Apache logs (access logs and error logs) are stored in log files.

Sumo Logic supports collecting logs via a local log file. Local log files can be collected via [Sumo Logic Installed collectors,](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) which requires you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work.

1. **Configure Apache to log to a local file(s)**. Apache logs written to a log file can be collected via the [Local File Source of a](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) Sumo Logic Installed collector. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must configure the logging of access logs and error logs via the instructions described in their [documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html).

To configure the Apache log file(s), locate your local **httpd.conf** configuration file in the Apache directory. After determining the location of the conf file, modify the **httpd.conf** configuration file logging parameters if required.

For access logs, the following directive is to be noted:
* CustomLog: access log file path and format (standard common and combined)

For error logs, the following directives are to be noted:
* ErrorLog: error log file path
* LogLevel: to control the number of messages logged to the error_log
2. **Configure an Installed Collector**. To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page [Configure an Installed Collector.](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors)
3. **Configure a Local File Source for Apache access logs**. To add a Local File Source for the Apache access log do the following
   1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
   * **Name.** (Required)
   * **Description.** (Optional)
   * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your Apache access logs. The files are typically located in `/var/log/apache2/access_log`. If you're using a customized path, check the httpd.conf file for this information.
   * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
   * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Prod/Apache/Access**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
   * **Fields**. Set the following fields. For more information on fields please see [this document](/docs/manage/fields):
    * `component = webserver`
    * `webserver_system = apache`
    * `webserver_farm = <your_apache_webserver_farmname>`
    * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as dev, qa, or prod.
   * The values of `webserver_farm` and `environment` should be the same as they were configured in the Configure and start telegraf section.
   * **Configure the Advanced Options for Logs section:**
   * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
   * **Time Zone.** Select Use time zone from the log file, if none is detected use “Use Collector Default”
   * **Timestamp Format.** Select Automatically detect the format.
   * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
   * Apache Access logs are single-line logs, uncheck **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**.
   3. Click **Save**. At this point, Apache access logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.
4. **Configure a Local File Source for Apache error logs**. To add a Local File Source for the Apache error log do the following:
   1. Add a[ Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
    * **Name.** (Required)
    * **Description.** (Optional)
    * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error_log. The files are typically located in `/var/log/apache2/error_log`. If you're using a customized path, check the httpd.conf file for this information.
    * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
    * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Prod/Apache/Error**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
    * **Fields**. Set the following fields. For more information on fields please see [this document](/docs/manage/fields):
    ```sql
    component = webserver
    webserver_system = apache
    webserver_farm = <your_apache_webserver_farmname>
    environment = <Environment_Name>--such as dev, qa or prod
    ```
   * The values of `webserver_farm` and `environment` should be the same as they were configured in the Configure and start telegraf section.
   * **Configure the Advanced Options for Logs section:**
   * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
   * **Time Zone.** Select Use time zone from the log file, if none is detected use “Use Collector Default”
   * **Timestamp Format.** Select Automatically detect the format.
   * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
   * Apache Error logs are multiline-line logs, Select **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** and **Boundary Regex: Expression to match message boundary**.
   * If error messages starts like `[Mon May 17 14:12:14.462704 2021]` then use boundary regex as below  
    ```bash
    ^\[\S{3}\s\S{3}\s\d{1,2}\s[^\]]+\].*
    ```
   3. Click **Save**. At this point, Apache Error logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.
