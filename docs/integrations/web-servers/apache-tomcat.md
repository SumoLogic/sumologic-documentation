The Apache Tomcat app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health and resource utilization of your Apache Tomcat servers. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into visitor locations, traffic patterns, errors, resource utilization, garbage collection, web server operations and access from known malicious sources.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Apache Tomcat

Before installing the Sumo Logic app, Apache Tomcat must be set up and configured to log events.

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Apache Tomcat. Configuring log and metric collection for the Apache Tomcat app includes the following tasks.

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using Apache Tomcat in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_webserver_system`
* `pod_labels_webserver_farm`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using Apache Tomcat in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `component`
* `environment`
* `webserver_system`
* `webserver_farm`
* `pod`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Configure Collection for Apache Tomcat

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Apache Tomcat in a Kubernetes environment. Four services in the architecture shown below make up the metric collection pipeline:
Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/apachetomcat-k8s.png')} alt="apache-k8s" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Apache Tomcat. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment, for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Apache Tomcat and Jolokia2 input plugin to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection:

1. Configure Metrics Collection
    1. Setup Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf operator
    2. Add annotations on your Apache Tomcat pods
2. Configure Logs Collection
    1. Configure logging in Apache Tomcat.
    2. Add labels on your Apache Tomcat pods to capture logs from standard output.
    3. Collecting Apache Tomcat Logs from a Log file.

**Prerequisites**

It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/main/docs/v3-migration-doc.md).


#### Step 1: Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Apache Tomcat metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more on this[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). Follow the steps listed below to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment:

1. [**Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator**](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf). Please ensure that you are monitoring your Kubernetes clusters with the Telegraf operator **enabled**. If you are not, then please follow [these instructions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf) to do so.
2. **Install jolokia on your Tomcat Pod to use the Jolokia Telegraf Input Plugin**
* Download the latest version of the Jolokia war file from: [https://jolokia.org/download.html](https://jolokia.org/download.html).
* Rename the file from jolokia-war-X.X.X.war to jolokia.war
* Create a configMap **jolokia** from the binary file `kubectl create configmap jolokia --from-file=jolokia.jar`
* Create volume mount the jolokia.war file to `${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps`.
```yml
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: jolokia
      configMap:
        name: jolokia
  containers:
    - name: XYZ
      image: XYZ
      env:
      - name: TOMCAT_OPTS
        value: "-javaagent:/opt/jolokia/jolokia.jar=port=8778,host=0.0.0.0"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/opt/jolokia"
          name: jolokia
```

* Add jolokia as role in tomcat-users.xml

```xml
<tomcat-users>
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <user name="admin" password="admin" roles="admin-gui,admin-script,manager-gui,manager-status,manager-script,manager-jmx"/>
</tomcat-users>
```

**Verification Step**: You can ssh to Tomcat pod and run following commands to make sure Telegraf (and Jolokia) is scraping metrics from your Tomcat Pod:
```bash
curl localhost:9273/metrics
```
1. **Add annotations on your Apache Tomcat pods**. On your Apache Tomcat Pods, add the following annotations:

```sql
annotations:
  telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/port: "9273"
  telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+

    Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **please do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section, which is [inputs.Tomcat.tags]
        * `component: “webserver”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.

    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]`
        * `component: “webserver”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `webserver_system: “tomcat”` - This value identifies the web server system.

    For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

1. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
2. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.

#### Step 2: Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Apache Tomcat logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. (Recommended Method) Add labels on your Apache Tomcat pods to capture logs from standard output.

Follow the instructions below to capture Apache Tomcat logs from stdout on Kubernetes.

1. Apply following labels to the Apache Tomcat pods:
```sql
   environment: "prod_CHANGEME"
    component: "webserver"
    webserver_system: "tomcat"
        webserver_farm: "tomcat_prod__CHANGEME"
```

Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):

* `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Tomcat farm identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
* `Webserver_farm` - Enter a name to identify this Tomcat farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

    Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **please do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.

* `component: “webserver”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `webserver_system: “tomcat”` - This value identifies the webserver system.

    For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

1. The Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection will automatically capture the logs from stdout and will send the logs to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, [visit](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_the_Kubernetes_App) here.
2. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
1. **(Optional) Collecting Apache Tomcat Logs from a Log File**

Follow the  steps below to capture Apache Tomcat logs from a log file on Kubernetes.

1. Determine the location of the Apache Tomcat log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the Tomcat.conf for your Tomcat farm along with the mounts on the Tomcat pods.
2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.

```sql
annotations:
  tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_Tomcat_log_file>/<Tomcat_log_file_name>
```

Example:

```sql
annotations:
  tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/opt/tomcat/logs/tomcat.log
```

1. Make sure that the Tomcat pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
```xml
kubectl describe pod <Tomcat_pod_name>
```
2. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
3. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
4. **Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**

Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for WebServer Application Components. To do so:

1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear:
4. Enter the following options:
  * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Webserver**.
  * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
  * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
  * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression:
    ```sql
    pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=webserver pod_labels_webserver_farm=* pod_labels_webserver_system=*
    ```
  * **Parse Expression**.Enter the following parse expression:
    ```sql
    if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
    | pod_labels_component as component
    | pod_labels_webserver_system as webserver_system
        | pod_labels_webserver_farm as webserver_farm
    ```
5. Click **Save** to create the rule.

<TabItem value="non-k8s">

We use the Telegraf operator for Apache Tomcat metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Apache Tomcat logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Apache Tomcat collection in a non-Kubernetes environment.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/apache-nonk8s.png')} alt="apache-nonk8s" />

Telegraf runs on the same system as Apache Tomcat and uses the [Apache Tomcat](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/memcached#configuration) and [Jolokia2](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) input plugin to obtain Apache Tomcat metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Apache Tomcat on the other hand are sent to a Sumo Logic Local File source.

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Apache Tomcat. Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection:

1. Configure Metrics Collection
    1. Configure a Hosted Collector
    2. Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source
    3. Install Telegraf
    4. Download and setup Jolokia on each Apache Tomcat node
    5. Configure and start Telegraf
2. Configure Logs Collection
    6. Configure logging in Apache Tomcat
    7. Configure Sumo Logic Installed Collector

#### Step 1: Configure Metrics Collection

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#create-a-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
1. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following[ these instructions. ](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics)Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
1. **Install Telegraf**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
1. **Download and setup Jolokia on each Apache Tomcat node**.** As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Jolokia input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.
  * Download the latest version of the Jolokia JVM-Agent from [Jolokia](https://jolokia.org/download.html).
  * Rename downloaded Jar file to jolokia.jar.
  * Save the file jolokia.jar on your apache tomcat server in `${TOMCAT_HOME}/webapps`.
  * Configure Apache Tomcat to use Jolokia.
      1. Add following to tomcat-users.xml
      <role rolename="**role-CHANGEME**" /> 
      <user name="**username-CHANGEME**" password="**password-CHANGEME**" roles="**role-CHANGEME**" />
      2. Start or Restart Apache Tomcat Service
      3. Verify the Jolokia agent installation by curl-ing this URL: `http://<tomcat_address>:<tomcat_port>/jolokia/version`.
      ```bash
      curl -v -u **username-CHANGEME**:**password-CHANGEME** "`http://APACHE_TOMCAT_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:<TOMCAT_PORT>/jolokia/version`"
      ```

The result looks similar to this

```json

      "version":"7.0.76"
    }
  },
  "timestamp":1625232354,
  "status":200
}
```
1. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Apache Tomcat input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/tomcat) and [jolokia2 input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.

Create or modify telegraf.conf and copy and paste the text below:  

```sql
[[inputs.tomcat]]

Please enter values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):

* In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.tomcat]]`:
    * `servers` - The URL to the Tomcat server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Tomcat servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/tomcat) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Tomcat input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.tomcat.tags]`
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Tomcat farm identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `Webserver_farm` - Enter a name to identify this Tomcat farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]`:
    * `servers` - The URL to the Tomcat server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Tomcat servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/jolokia2) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Tomcat input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.jolokia2_agent.tags]`:
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Tomcat farm identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `webserver_farm`- Enter a name to identify this Tomcat farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
    * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this Telegraf configuration.

**Do not modify** the configuration, as it will cause the SumoLogic apps to not function correctly.

* `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
* `Component: “webserver”` - In the input plugins section, which are `[[inputs.tomcat]]` and `[[inputs.jolokia2_agent]]` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `webserver_system: “tomcat”` - In the input plugins sections.In other words, this value identifies the webserver system
*  For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Tomcat metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

#### Step 2 Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Apache Tomcat running on a non-kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for Apache Tomcat.

By default, Apache Tomcat logs are stored in a log file. Sumo Logic supports collecting logs via a local log file. Local log files can be collected via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors). An Installed collector will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for Installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements#Installed-Collector-Requirements).

Based on your infrastructure and networking setup choose one of these methods to collect Tomcat logs and follow the instructions below to set up log collection:

1. **Configure logging in Apache Tomcat**

    Varnish supports logging via the following methods: local text log files


    The Sumo Logic app for Apache Tomcat uses three types of logs

1. Tomcat Access logs \
Log format description: [https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html  \
](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html)Recommended pattern used is pattern="common"
2. Tomcat Catalina.out logs \
Log format description: [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/SimpleFormatter.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/SimpleFormatter.html)
3. Tomcat Garbage Collection (GC) logs \
Log format description: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4468546/explanation-of-tomcat-gc-log-statements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4468546/explanation-of-tomcat-gc-log-statements)
1. **Configure Tomcat to log to a Local file**. By default, Tomcat logs are stored in /usr/share/tomcat/logs/ The default directory for log files is listed in the /usr/share/tomcat/conf/logging.properties file. Logs from the Tomcat log file can be collected via a Sumo Logic [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) and a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) as explained in the next section.

1. **Configuring a Collector**. To collect logs directly from the Tomcat machine, configure an[ Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).

1. **Configuring a Source**. To add a Local File Source source for Apache Tomcat do the following** To collect logs directly from your Tomcat machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.

1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
  * **Name.** (Required)
  * **Description.** (Optional)
  * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in **/usr/share/tomcat/logs/***. If you're using a customized path, check the Tomcat.conf file for this information.
  * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
  * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Tomcat/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
  * **Fields.** Set the following fields:
    ```sh
    * component = websystem
    * webserver_system = tomcat
    * webserver_farm = <Your_Tomcat_Farm_Name>
    * environment = <Environment_Name> #such as Dev, QA or Prod.
    ```
1. Configure the **Advanced** section:
* **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
* **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your Tomcat Server’s time zone.
* **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected. **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
* **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
    * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
1. Click **Save**.

At this point, Tomcat logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

This section has instructions for installing Sumo Logic Monitors for Apache Tomcat, the app and descriptions of each of the app dashboards.

## Installing Apache Tomcat Monitors

Sumo Logic has provided pre-packaged alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you proactively determine if an Apache Tomcat webserver farm is available and performing as expected. These monitors are based on metric and log data and include pre-set thresholds that reflect industry best practices and recommendations. For more information about individual alerts, see [Apache Tomcat Alerts](/docs/integrations/web-servers/apache-tomcat#apache-tomcat-alerts).

To install these monitors, you must have the **Manage Monitors** role capability.

You can install monitors by importing a JSON file or using a Terraform script.

Use this dashboard to:mits to how many alerts can be enabled. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors#Rules) for details.

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/ApacheTomcat/ApacheTomcat.json) that describes the monitors.
2. The [JSON](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/ApacheTomcat/ApacheTomcat.json) contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters, and therefore will be applicable to all Apache Tomcat webserver farms, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.  

However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `webserver_farm=` with `<Your Custom Filter>`.

Custom filter examples:
1. For alerts applicable only to a specific webserver farm, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=dev-tomcat-01`
2. For alerts applicable to all webserver farms that start with tomcat-prod, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=tomcat-prod*`
3. For alerts applicable to a specific webserver farm, within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=dev-tomcat-01 AND environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.

1. Go to **Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Click **Import**.
4. On the **Import Content popup**, enter **Apache Tomcat** in the Name field, paste in the JSON into the popup, and click **Import**.
5. The monitors are created in a "Apache Tomcat" folder. The monitors are disabled by default. See the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) topic for information about enabling monitors and configuring notifications or connections.

### Method B: Using a Terraform script

Step 1: Generate a Sumo Logic access key and ID

Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the **Manage Monitors** role capability. For instructions see  [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key_on_Preferences_page).

Step 2: Download and install Terraform

Download [Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later, and install it.

Step 3: Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Apache Tomcat monitors

The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic github [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/ApacheTomcat). You can either download it using the git clone command or as a zip file.

Step 4: Alert Configuration  

After extracting the package , navigate to the  terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/ApacheTomcat/ directory.

Edit the ApacheTomcat.auto.tfvars file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key and Access ID from Step 1 and your Sumo Logic deployment. If you're not sure of your deployment, see [Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).

```sql
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```

The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the `apachetomcat_data_source` variable. For example:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>To configure alerts for:   </td>
   <td>Set <code>apachetomcat_data_source</code> to something like:   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A specific webserver farm   </td>
   <td><code>webserver_farm=tomcat.prod.01</code>   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>All clusters in an environment   </td>
   <td><code>environment=prod</code>   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Multiple webserver farms using a wildcard   </td>
   <td><code>webserver_farm=tomcat-prod*</code>   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>A specific webserver farms within a specific environment </td>
   <td><code>webserver_farm=tomcat-1</code> and <code>environment=prod</code>
<p>This assumes you have configured and applied Fields as described in Step 1: Configure Fields of the <em>Sumo Logic of the Collect Logs and Metrics for Apache Tomcat</em> topic.</p> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

All monitors are disabled by default on installation. To enable all of the monitors, set the monitors_disabled parameter to false.

By default, the monitors will be located in a "Apache Tomcat" folder on the **Monitors** page. To change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in the folder variable in the ApacheTomcat.auto.tfvars file.

If you want the alerts to send email or connection notifications, follow the instructions in the next section.

Step 5: Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples

Edit the ApacheTomcat_notifications.auto.tfvars file to populate the connection_notifications and email_notifications sections. Examples are provided below.

In the variable definition below, replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection ID of the Webhook connection. You can obtain the Webhook connection ID by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

For information about overriding the payload for different connection types, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).

```bash title="Pagerduty connection example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

```bash title="Email notifications example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

Step 6: Install Monitors

1. Navigate to the terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/ApacheTomcat/ directory and run terraform init. This will initialize Terraform and download the required components.
2. Run terraform plan to view the monitors that Terraform will create or modify.
3. Run terraform apply.

This section demonstrates how to install the Apache Tomcat app.

## Installing the Apache Tomcat app

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.

Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the[ Install the Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).

3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
2. **Data Source.**
* Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom filter for Apache Tomcat  webserver farm. Examples:
* For all Apache Tomcat webserver farms webserver_farm=*
* For a specific webserver farms: webserver_farm=tomcat.dev.01. 
* Clusters within a specific environment: `webserver_farm=tomcat-1 and environment=prod`
(This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)  
3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

## Viewing Apache Tomcat dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).
