## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Varnish

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic App for Varnish.

Configuring log and metric collection for the Varnish App includes the following tasks:

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic before configuring the collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which the app dashboards require. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'For Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'For Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using Varnish in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_cache_system`
* `pod_labels_cache_cluster`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using Varnish in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
* `component`
* `environment`
* `cache_system`
* `cache_cluster`
* `pod`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2: Configure Logs and Metrics Collection

Instructions below show how to configure Kubernetes and Non-Kubernetes environments.

The Sumo Logic App for Varnish has been tested for Varnish Version: 6.4.

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Varnish in a Kubernetes environment. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Prometheus, Fluentd, and FluentBit.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/varnish-k8s.png')} alt="Varnish" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Varnish. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment, for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Varnish input plugin to obtain metrics. (For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.) The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator. We also have Fluentbit that collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to FluentD, which in turn sends all the logs and metrics data to a Sumo Logic HTTP Source.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/blob/release-v2.0/deploy/docs/v2_migration_doc.md#how-to-upgrade).

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Varnish metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

1. [Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator.](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf)
2. On your Varnish Pods, add the following annotations:
  ```sql
  annotations:
    telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9273"
    telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
    [[inputs.varnish]]
     use_sudo = true
     binary = "/usr/bin/varnishstat"
     stats = ["*"]
     [inputs.varnish.tags]
      component="cache"
      environment="dev_CHANGME"
      cache_system="varnish"
      cache_cluster="varnish_on_k8s_CHANGEME"
  ```

Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs` - This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf varnish Input plugin. Please refer[ to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As telegraf will be run as a sidecar, the host should always be localhost.
    * In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.varnish]]`
        * `binary `-  The default location of the varnish stat binary. Please override as per your configuration.
        * `use_sudo `- If running as a restricted user, prepend sudo for additional access.
        * `stats `- Stats may also be set to ["*"], which will collect all stats. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `environment `- This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `cache_cluster `- Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **please do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus` - This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"` - This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"` - This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section, `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `component: “cache”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `cache_system: “varnish”` - This value identifies the web server system.

For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

3. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect Varnish logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **(Recommended Method) Add labels on your Varnish pods to capture logs from standard output**. Follow the instructions below to capture Varnish logs from stdout on Kubernetes.
   1. Apply following labels to the Varnish pods:
   ```bash
   environment: "prod_CHANGEME"
   component: "cache"
   cache_system: "varnish"
   cache_cluster: "varnish_on_k8s_CHANGEME"
   ```
   2. Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):
   * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
   * `cache_cluster` - Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this configuration that we request you **please do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
* `component: “cache”` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `cache_system: “varnish”` - This value identifies the cache system.

For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

2. **(Optional) Collecting Varnish Logs from a Log File. Follow the steps below to capture Varnish logs from a log file on Kubernetes**.
   1. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   2. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
    ```xml
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_Varnish_log_file>/<Varnish_log_file_name>
    ```
   Example:
    ```bash
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data: /var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log
    ```
   3. Make sure that the Varnish pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <Varnish_pod_name>
   ```
   4. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
   5. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
3. **Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments**. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for WebServer Application Components. To do so:
   1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
   3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear:
   4. Enter the following options:
     * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Cache**.
     * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
     * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
     * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression:
     ```sql
     pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=cache pod_labels_cache_cluster=* pod_labels_cache_cluster=
     ```
     * **Parse Expression**.Enter the following parse expression:
     ```sql
     if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
     | pod_labels_component as component
     | pod_labels_cache_system as cache_system
     | pod_labels_cache_cluster as cache_cluste
     ```
   5. Click **Save** to create the rule.

<TabItem value="non-k8s">

We use the Telegraf operator for Varnish metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Varnish logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Varnish collection in a non-Kubernetes environment.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/varnish-nonk8s.png')} alt="Varnish" />

Telegraf runs on the same system as Varnish, and uses the [Varnish input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) to obtain Varnish metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Varnish on the other hand are sent to a Sumo Logic Local File source.

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic App for Varnish.

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#create-a-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following[ these instructions. ](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics)Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. **Install Telegraf**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
4. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Varnish input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.  

Create or modify telegraf.conf and copy and paste the text below:  
```sql
 use_sudo = true
  binary = "/usr/bin/varnishstat"
  stats = ["*"]
  [inputs.varnish.tags]
   component="cache"
   environment="dev_CHANGME"
   cache_system="varnish"
   cache_cluster="varnish_on_premise_CHANGEME"

  url = "<URL Created in Step 3_CHANGEME>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```


Please enter values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):

* In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.varnish]]`
    * **`binary`** -  The default location of the varnish stat binary. Please override as per your configuration.
    * `use_sudo` - If running as a restricted user, prepend sudo for additional access.
    * **`stats`** - Stats may also be set to ["*"], which will collect all stats. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `environment` - This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example; dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * **`cache_cluster` **- Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`
    * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this Telegraf configuration that we request you **please do not modify** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
* `data_format=“prometheus”` - In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
* `Component=“cache”` - In the input plugins section, which is, `[[inputs.varnish]]` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `cache_system: “varnish”` - In the input plugins sections. In other words, this value identifies the cache system
* For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/telegraf.conf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Varnish metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Varnish running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for Varnish.

By default, Varnish logs are stored in a log file. Sumo Logic supports collecting logs via a local log file. Local log files can be collected via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors). An Installed collector will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#Sumo-Logic-Endpoints-and-Firewall-Security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for Installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements#Installed-Collector-Requirements).


1. **Configure logging in Varnish**. Varnish supports logging via the following methods: local text log files. For details please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/). For the dashboards to work properly, please set the below specified log format as explained [here](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1):
```bash
%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"
```
2. **Configure Varnish to log to a Local file**. By default, any installation of varnishd will not write any request logs to disk. Instead, Varnish has an in-memory log, and supplies tools to tap into this log and write to disk. To configure logging to a local file, follow the steps on [this](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#enable-varnishncsa-logging) page. By default, Varnish logs are stored in **/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log**. For customized options please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1). Logs from the Varnish log file can be collected via a Sumo Logic [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors) and a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) as explained in the next section.
3. **Configuring a Collector**. To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page[ Configure an Installed Collector.](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors)
4. **Configuring a Source**: To add a Local File Source source for Varnish do the following. To collect logs directly from your Varnish machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.  
   1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
     * **Name.** (Required)
     * **Description.** (Optional)
     * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in **/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log**.
     * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
     * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Varnish/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices.md).)
     * **Fields. **Set the following fields:
       * `component = cache`
       * `cache_system = varnish`
       * `cache_cluster = <Your_Varnish_Cluster_Name>`
       * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod.
   3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
     * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
     * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your Varnish Server’s time zone.
     * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
     * **Encoding. **Select** **UTF-8 (Default).
     * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
    * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
   4. Click **Save**.

At this point, Varnish logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

</Tabs>

## Installing Varnish Monitors

Sumo Logic has provided pre-packaged alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you proactively determine if a Varnish cluster is available and performing as expected. These monitors are based on metric and log data and include pre-set thresholds that reflect industry best practices and recommendations. For more information about individual alerts, see [Varnish Alerts](#Varnish-Alerts).

To install these monitors, you must have the **Manage Monitors** role capability.

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors#Rules) for details.

You can install monitors by importing a JSON file or using a Terraform script.

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/RabbitMQ/rabbitmq.json) that describes the monitors.
2. The [JSON](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/RabbitMQ/rabbitmq.json) contains the alerts based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters. Therefore, it will apply to all Varnish clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.   However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `cache_cluster=* `with `<Your Custom Filter>`. Custom filter examples:
   * For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be `cache_cluster=dev-varnish01`
   * For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with `varnish`-prod, your custom filter would be `cache_cluster=varnish-prod*`
   * For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment, your custom filter would be `cache_cluster=dev-varnish01` AND `environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.
3. Go to **Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors**.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Click **Import.**
6. On the** Import Content popup**, enter **Varnish** in the Name field, paste the JSON into the popup, and click **Import**.
7. The monitors are created in a "Varnish" folder. The monitors are disabled by default. See the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) topic for information about enabling monitors and configuring notifications or connections.


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate an access key and access ID for a user with the **Manage Monitors** role capability; for instructions, see  [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key_on_Preferences_page).
2. Download [Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later and install it.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for MySQL monitor. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages). You can either download it using the git clone command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration. After extracting the package , navigate to the terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/Varnish/ directory.

Edit the `varnish.auto.tfvars` file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key and Access ID from Step 1 and your Sumo Logic deployment. If you're not sure of your deployment, see [Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).

```sql
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```

The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters; if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the `varnish_data_source variable`. For example:
   * To configure alerts for a specific cluster, set `varnish_data_source` to something like: `cache_cluster=varnish.prod.01`
   * To configure alerts for All clusters in an environment, set `varnish_data_source` to something like: `environment=prod`
   * To configure alerts for multiple clusters using a wildcard, set `varnish_data_source` to something like: `cache_cluster=varnish-prod*`
   * To configure alerts for a specific cluster within a specific environment, set `varnish_data_source` to something like: `cache_cluster=varnish-1 and environment=prod`. This assumes you have configured and applied Fields as described in [Step 1: Configure Fields for Sumo Logic](#step-1-configure-fields-in-sumo-logic).

All monitors are disabled by default on installation. To enable all of the monitors, set the `monitors_disabled` parameter to false.

By default, the monitors will be located in a "Varnish" folder on the **Monitors** page. To change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in the folder variable in the `varnish.auto.tfvars` file.

5. If you want the alerts to send email or connection notifications, edit the `varnish_notifications.auto.tfvars` file to populate the `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` sections. Examples are provided below.

```bash title="Pagerduty connection example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

In the variable definition below, replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection ID of the Webhook connection. You can obtain the Webhook connection ID by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

For information about overriding the payload for different connection types, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/manage/connections-integrations/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections.md).

```bash title="Email notifications example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

6. Install Monitors:
   1. Navigate to the `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/varnish/` directory and run terraform init. This will initialize Terraform and download the required components.
   2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors that Terraform will create or modify.
   3. Run `terraform apply`.
7. This section demonstrates how to install the Varnish App.

## Viewing Varnish Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards-new/filter-template-variables.md).
