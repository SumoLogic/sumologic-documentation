## Collecting logs and metrics for Varnish

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Varnish.

Configuring log and metric collection for the Varnish app includes the following tasks:

### Configure logs and metrics collection

The Sumo Logic app for Varnish has been tested for Varnish Version: 6.4.

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Varnish in a Kubernetes environment. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/varnish-k8s.png')} alt="Varnish" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Varnish. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment, for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Varnish input plugin to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins. The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest Helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes).

### Configure metrics collection

This section explains the steps to collect Varnish metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

1. [Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf).
2. On your Varnish Pods, add the following annotations:
  ```sql
  annotations:
    telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9273"
    telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
    [[inputs.varnish]]
     use_sudo = true
     binary = "/usr/bin/varnishstat"
     stats = ["*"]
     [inputs.varnish.tags]
      component="cache"
      environment="dev_CHANGME"
      cache_system="varnish"
      cache_cluster="varnish_on_k8s_CHANGEME"
  ```

Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):

* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf Varnish input plugin. Please refer to this [doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As Telegraf will be run as a sidecar, the host should always be localhost.
    * In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.varnish]]`
        * `binary`. The default location of the Varnish stat binary. Please override as per your configuration.
        * `use_sudo`. If running as a restricted user, prepend sudo for additional access.
        * `stats`. Stats may also be set to `["*"]`, which will collect all stats. See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of servers resides. For example: dev, prod, or qa. While this value is optional, we highly recommend setting it.
        * `cache_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

**Do not modify** the following values set by this configuration, as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`. This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`. This tells Prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`
    * In the tags section, `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `component: “cache”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
        * `cache_system: “varnish”`. This value identifies the web server system.

For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

3. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.

### Configure logs collection

This section explains the steps to collect Varnish logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **(Recommended Method) Add labels on your Varnish pods to capture logs from standard output**. Follow the instructions below to capture Varnish logs from stdout on Kubernetes.
   1. Apply the following labels to the Varnish pods:
   ```bash
   environment: "prod_CHANGEME"
   component: "cache"
   cache_system: "varnish"
   cache_cluster: "varnish_on_k8s_CHANGEME"
   ```
   2. Enter the values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` in the snippet above):
   * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod, or qa. While this value is optional,l we highly recommend setting it.
   * `cache_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

**Do not modify** the following values set by this configuration, as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
* `component: “cache”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `cache_system: “varnish”`. This value identifies the cache system.

For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

2. (Optional) Collecting Varnish Logs from a Log File. Follow the steps below to capture Varnish logs from a log file on Kubernetes.
   1. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
   2. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
    ```xml
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_Varnish_log_file>/<Varnish_log_file_name>
    ```
   Example:
    ```bash
    annotations:
      tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data: /var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log
    ```
   3. Make sure that the Varnish pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod <Varnish_pod_name>
   ```
   4. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
   5. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.

<br/>**FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments.** Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, a Field Extraction Rule named **AppObservabilityVarnishFER** is automatically created for Varnish Application Components.
<br/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

We use the Telegraf operator for Varnish metric collection and the Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Varnish logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Varnish collection in a non-Kubernetes environment.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/varnish-nonk8s.png')} alt="Varnish" />

Telegraf runs on the same system as Varnish and uses the [Varnish input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) to obtain Varnish metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Varnish, on the other hand, are sent to a Sumo Logic Local File source.

### Configure metrics collection

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Varnish.

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. **Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following the instructions given in this [document](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. **Install Telegraf**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
4. **Configure and start Telegraf**. As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [Varnish input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.  

Create or modify telegraf.conf and copy and paste the text below:  
```sql
 use_sudo = true
  binary = "/usr/bin/varnishstat"
  stats = ["*"]
  [inputs.varnish.tags]
   component="cache"
   environment="dev_CHANGME"
   cache_system="varnish"
   cache_cluster="varnish_on_premise_CHANGEME"

  url = "<URL Created in Step 3_CHANGEME>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```

Please enter values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):

* In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.varnish]]`
    * **`binary`** -  The default location of the Varnish stat binary. Please override as per your configuration.
    * `use_sudo` - If running as a restricted user, prepend sudo for additional access.
    * **`stats`** - Stats may also be set to ["*"], which will collect all stats. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/varnish) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Varnish input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.varnish.tags]`
        * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Varnish cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example, dev, prod, or qa. While this value is optional, we highly recommend setting it.
        * `cache_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`
    * `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

**Do not modify** the following values set by this Telegraf configuration, as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
* `data_format=“prometheus”`. In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic
* `Component=“cache”`. In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.varnish]]` - This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `cache_system: “varnish”`. In the input plugins sections. In other words, this value identifies the cache system
* For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Varnish metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

### Configure logs collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for Varnish running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic app for Varnish.

By default, Varnish logs are stored in a log file. Sumo Logic supports collecting logs via a local log file. Local log files can be collected via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors). An installed collector will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements#installed-collector-requirements).

1. **Configure logging in Varnish**. Varnish supports logging via the following methods: local text log files. For details, please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/). For the dashboards to work properly, please set the below-specified log format as explained [here](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1):
```bash
%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"
```
2. **Configure Varnish to log to a Local file**. By default, any installation of varnishd will not write any request logs to disk. Instead, Varnish has an in-memory log and supplies tools to tap into this log and write to disk. To configure logging to a local file, follow the steps on [this](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#enable-varnishncsa-logging) page. By default, Varnish logs are stored in **/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log**. For customized options, please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1). Logs from the Varnish log file can be collected via a Sumo Logic [Installed collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) and a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source) as explained in the next section.
3. **Configuring a Collector**. To add an installed collector, perform the steps given in the [Configure an Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) document.
4. **Configuring a Source**: To add a Local File Source for Varnish, do the following. To collect logs directly from your Varnish machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.  
   1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
   2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
     * **Name.** (Required)
     * **Description.** (Optional)
     * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in **/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log**.
     * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
     * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Varnish/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices.md).)
     * **Fields.** Set the following fields:
       * `component = cache`
       * `cache_system = varnish`
       * `cache_cluster = <Your_Varnish_Cluster_Name>`
       * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA, or Prod.
   3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
     * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
     * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your Varnish Server’s time zone.
     * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
     * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
     * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
    * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
   4. Click **Save**.

At this point, Varnish logs should start flowing into Sumo Logic.
