Nginx is a web server used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache. The Sumo Logic App for Nginx helps you monitor activity in Nginx. The preconfigured dashboards provide information about site visitors, including the location of visitors, devices/operating systems, and browsers used, and information about server activity, including bots, observed, and error information.

The app has been tested with Nginx version: 1.19.8, 1.21.4, 1.23.1.

We use the OpenTelemetry collector for Nginx metric collection and for collecting Nginx logs.

The diagram below illustrates the components of the Nginx collection for each web server.

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Nginx-OpenTelemetry/Nginx-Schematic.png' alt="Schematic" />

OpenTelemetry collector runs on the same host as Nginx, and uses the [Nginx Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver) to obtain Nginx metrics, and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Nginx logs are sent to Sumo Logic through a [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Log Types and Metrics

The Sumo Logic App for Nginx assumes:

- Nginx app supports the default access logs and error logs format.
- For a list of metrics that are collected and used by the app, see [Nginx Metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/nginxreceiver/documentation.md).

## Fields Creation in Sumo Logic for Nginx

Following are the [Fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of Nginx App install if not already present.

- `webengine.cluster.name`. User configured.Enter a name to uniquely identify your Nginx web server cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
- `webengine.node.name`. Has value of host name.
- `webengine.system`. Has fixed value of nginx.
- `sumo.datasource`. Has fixed value of nginx.

## Prerequisites

* Configure your Nginx server to expose status endpoint for collecting metrics: The receiver used gets stats from an Nginx Web Server instance using the status endpoint. In order to receive server statistics, you must configure the server's nginx.conf file to [enable status support](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver#configuration).
* Configure and retrieve access and error log files: Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must configure the logging of errors and processed requests in NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. For instructions, refer to the following [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/logging/).

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up OpenTelemetry Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Nginx Collection.

Below are the inputs required:

- **Endpoint**. The URL of the status endpoint (default: `http://localhost:80/status`).
- **Access File log Path**. Enter the path to the Access log file for your nginx instance.
- **Error file log path**. Enter the path to the error log file for your nginx instance.
- **Fields**. `webengine.cluster.name` User configured. Enter a name to identify this nginx cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

## Viewing Nginx Dashboards

### Overview

The **Nginx - Overview** dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of the NGINX server access locations, error logs along with connection metrics.

Use this dashboard to:

- Gain insights into originated traffic location by region. This can help you allocate computer resources to different regions according to their needs.
- Gain insights into your Nginx health using Critical Errors and Status of Nginx Server.
- Get insights into Active and dropped connection.

### Error Logs

The **Nginx - Error Logs** Analysis dashboard provides a high-level view of log level breakdowns, comparisons, and trends. The panels also show the geographic locations of clients and clients with critical messages, new connections and outliers, client requests, request trends, and request outliers.

Use this dashboard to:

- Track requests from clients. A request is a message asking for a resource, such as a page or an image.
- Track and view client geographic locations generating errors.
- Track critical alerts and emergency error alerts.

### Trends

The **Nginx - Trends** dashboard provides a high-level view of the activity and health of Nginx servers on your network. Dashboard panels display visual graphs and detailed information on traffic volume and distribution, responses over time, as well as time comparisons for visitor locations and server hits.

Use this dashboard to:

- Understand the traffic distribution across servers, provide insights for resource planning by analyzing data volume and bytes served.
- Gain insights into originated traffic location by region. This can help you allocate compute resources to different regions according to their needs.

### Outlier Analysis

The **Nginx - Outlier Analysis** dashboard provides a high-level view of Nginx server outlier metrics for bytes served, number of visitors, and server errors. You can select the time interval over which outliers are aggregated, then hover the cursor over the graph to display detailed information for that point in time.

Use this dashboard to:

- Detect outliers in your infrastructure with Sumo Logic's machine learning algorithm.
- Identify outliers in incoming traffic and the number of errors encountered by your servers.

You can use schedule searches to send alerts to yourself whenever there is an outlier detected by Sumo Logic.

### Threat Intel

The **Nginx - Threat Intel** dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of threats to Nginx servers on your network. Dashboard panels display the threat count over a selected time period, geographic locations where threats occurred, source breakdown, actors responsible for threats, severity, and a correlation of IP addresses, method, and status code of threats.

Use this dashboard to:

- Gain insights and understand threats in incoming traffic and discover potential IOCs. Incoming traffic requests are analyzed using the [Sumo - Crowdstrikes](/docs/integrations/security-threat-detection/threat-intel-quick-analysis/#03_Threat-Intel-FAQ) threat feed.
