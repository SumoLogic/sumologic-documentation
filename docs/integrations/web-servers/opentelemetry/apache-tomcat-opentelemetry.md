The [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/index.html) app is a logs app that helps you get insight into visitor locations, traffic patterns, errors, resource utilization, garbage collection, web server operations, and access from known malicious sources.

Tomcat logs are sent to Sumo Logic through Opentelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields Created in Sumo Logic for Tomcat

The following are the [Fields](/docs/manage/fields) that will be created as part of the Tomcat App install, if not already present.

- `webengine.cluster.name`. User configured. Set a value of the cluster where your Tomcat instance resides. This will be tagged along with the data sent to Sumo.
- `webengine.system`. Has a fixed value of **tomcat**.
- `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **tomcat**.

### Prerequisites

The Sumo Logic app for Apache Tomcat uses three types of logs:

1. Tomcat Access logs. [Log format description](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html). Recommended pattern used is pattern="common".
2. Tomcat Catalina.out logs. [Log format description](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/SimpleFormatter.html)
3. Tomcat Garbage Collection (GC) logs. [Log format description](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4468546/explanation-of-tomcat-gc-log-statements)

By default, Tomcat logs are stored in `/usr/share/tomcat/logs/` The default directory for log files is listed in the `/usr/share/tomcat/conf/logging.properties` file.

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

<LogsCollectionPrereqisites/>

For Windows systems, log files which are collected should be accessible by the SYSTEM group. Use the following set of PowerShell commands if the SYSTEM group does not have access.

```
$NewAcl = Get-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>"
# Set properties
$identity = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
$fileSystemRights = "ReadAndExecute"
$type = "Allow"
# Create new rule
$fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList = $identity, $fileSystemRights, $type
$fileSystemAccessRule = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule -ArgumentList $fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList
# Apply new rule
$NewAcl.SetAccessRule($fileSystemAccessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" -AclObject $NewAcl
```

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Tomcat-OpenTelemetry/Apache-Tomcat-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Tomcat Collection.

The path of the log file configured to capture tomcat logs is needed to be given here.

The files are typically located in `/usr/share/tomcat/logs/*`. If you're using a customized path, check the Tomcat.conf file for this information.

You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

## Viewing Tomcat dashboards

### Overview

The **Apache Tomcat - Overview** Dashboard provides a high-level view of information on visitor geographic locations, responses over time, and number of error codes and top urls causing error.

Use this dashboard to:

- Analyze http request about status code.
- Gain insights into originated traffic location by region. This can help you allocate computer resources to different regions according to their needs.
- Gain insights into Client, Server Responses on Tomcat Server. This helps you identify errors in Tomcat Server.
