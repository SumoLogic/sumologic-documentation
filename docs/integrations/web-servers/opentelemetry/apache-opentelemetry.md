The [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html) app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health and resource utilization of Apache web server farms. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis: visitor locations, visitor access types, traffic patterns, errors, web server operations, resource utilization and access from known malicious sources.

The diagram below illustrates the components of the Apache collection for each web server. OpenTelemetry collector runs on the same host as Apache, and uses the [Apache Receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/apachereceiver) to obtain Apache metrics, and the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sumologicexporter) to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Apache logs are sent to Sumo Logic through a [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

The Sumo Logic app for Apache assumes:

- The [NCSA extended/combined log file format ](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html)has been configured for Apache access logs and the default error log format for Apache Access logs and Apache Error logs. For a list of metrics that are collected and used by the app, see [Apache Metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/apachereceiver/documentation.md).

## Fields Creation in Sumo Logic for Apache

Following are the [Fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of Apache App install if not already present.

- **`webengine.cluster.name`**. User configured.Enter a name to uniquely identify your Apache web server cluster. This web server cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
- **`webengine.system`**. Has fixed value of **apache**
- **`sumo.datasource`**. Has fixed value of **apache**
- **`webengine.node.name`**. Has the value of host name of the machine which is being monitored

## Prerequisites

### For metrics collection

The receiver used gets stats from an Apache Web Server instance using the `server-status?auto` endpoint. This receiver supports Apache Web Server version 2.4+.

**Receive server statistics** by configuring the server's `httpd.conf` file to [enable status support](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html).

### For logs collection

* **Configure the Apache log files**:
   * Configure the logging of access logs and error logs via the instructions described in their [documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html).
   * Locate your local `httpd.conf` configuration file in the Apache directory. After determining the location of the conf file, modify the `httpd.conf` configuration file logging parameters if required.
      * For access logs, the following directive is to be noted:
         - **CustomLog**. access log file path and format (standard common and combined)
      * For error logs, following directives are to be noted:
         - **ErrorLog**. Error log file path.
         - **LogLevel**. To control the number of messages logged to the `error_log`.

Ensure that the otelcol has adequate permissions to access all log file paths. Execute the following command for the same:

```
sudo setfacl -R -m d:u:otelcol-sumo:r-x,u:otelcol-sumo:r-x,g:otelcol-sumo:r-x <PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>
```

import LogsCollectionPrereqisites from '../../../reuse/apps/logs-collection-prereqisites.md';

<LogsCollectionPrereqisites/>

For Windows systems, log files which are collected should be accessible by the SYSTEM group. Use the following set of PowerShell commands if the SYSTEM group does not have access.

```
$NewAcl = Get-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>"
# Set properties
$identity = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
$fileSystemRights = "ReadAndExecute"
$type = "Allow"
# Create new rule
$fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList = $identity, $fileSystemRights, $type
$fileSystemAccessRule = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule -ArgumentList $fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList
# Apply new rule
$NewAcl.SetAccessRule($fileSystemAccessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" -AclObject $NewAcl
```

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

<SetupColl/>

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Apache-OpenTelemetry/Apache-Collector.png' style={{border:'1px solid black'}} alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Apache Collection.

Below are the inputs required:

- **Endpoint**. The URL of the httpd status endpoint (default: `http://localhost:8080/server-status?auto`).
- **Access File log Path**. Enter the path to the Access log file for your mysql instance.
- **Error file log path**. Enter the path to the error log file for your mysql instance.
- **Fields**. `webengine.cluster.name`.

You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.
