The Sumo Logic App for [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/intro/) provides dashboards that help you analyze logs generated by Varnish servers. This app allows you to identify traffic sources, improve application and website workflows, and understand how customers use your product.

Varnish logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for Varnish

- `webengine.cluster.name`. User configured. Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
- `webengine.system`. Has a fixed value of **varnish**.
- `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **varnish**.

## Prerequisites

* Configure logging in Varnish. Varnish supports logging via local text log files. For details please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/). For the dashboards to work properly, set the Varnish log format as explained [here](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1):
  ```bash
  %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"
  ```
* Configure Varnish to log to a local file. By default, any installation of varnishd will not write any request logs to disk. Instead, Varnish has an in-memory log, and supplies tools to tap into this log and write to disk. To configure logging to a local file, follow the steps on [this](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#enable-varnishncsa-logging) page. By default, Varnish logs are stored in /var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log. For customized options please visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1).

## Collection Configuration and App installation

{@import ../../../reuse/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md}

### Step 1: Set up Collector

{@import ../../../reuse/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md}

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Varnish-OpenTelemetry/Varnish-Collector.png' alt="Collector" />

### Step 2: Configure integration

OpenTelemetry works with a [configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) yaml file which has all the details with respect to the data which needs to be collected. For example, it specifies the location of a log file that is read and sent to the Sumo Logic platform.

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Varnish Collection. You'll need to provide the path of the log file configured to capture Varnish logs.

The files are located in `/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log` by default. For more details, refer the the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section of this page. You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo

{@import ../../../reuse/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md}

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Linux"
  values={[
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'Linux'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'macOS'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Linux">

1. Copy the yaml at `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Varnish instance which needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the otelcol-sumo process using the below command 
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart otelcol-sumo
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macOS">

1. Copy the yaml at `/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/` folder in the Varnish instance which needs to be monitored.
2. Restart the otelcol-sumo process using the below command 
  ```sh
  otelcol-sumo --config /etc/otelcol-sumo/sumologic.yaml --conf "glob:/etc/otelcol-sumo/conf.d/*.yaml"
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Sample Log Messages in Non-Kubernetes environments

```sql
175.120.107.250 - - [24/Jan/2023:14:37:44 +0530] "POST /_media/resource_thumb_video_my_v2_homepage.jpg HTTP/1.1" 404 99737883 "http://yahoo.com/5.0 (iPad; CPU OS 6_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/536.26 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Mobile/10A5355d Safari/8536.25"
```

### Sample Query

This sample query is from the **Varnish Overview - Traffic Volume** dashboard > **MB Served Over Time** panel.

```sql title="Query String"
