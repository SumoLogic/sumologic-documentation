The Sumo Logic app for [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/intro/) provides dashboards that help you analyze logs generated by Varnish servers. This app allows you to identify traffic sources, improve application and website workflows, and understand how customers use your product.

Varnish logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for Varnish

- `webengine.cluster.name`. User configured. Enter a name to identify this Varnish cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
- `webengine.system`. Has a fixed value of **varnish**.
- `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **varnish**.

## Prerequisites

* Configure logging in Varnish. Varnish supports logging via local text log files. For details visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/). For the dashboards to work properly, set the Varnish log format as explained [here](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1):
  ```bash
  %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"
  ```
* Configure Varnish to log to a local file. By default, any installation of varnishd will not write any request logs to disk. Instead, Varnish has an in-memory log, and supplies tools to tap into this log and write to disk. To configure logging to a local file, follow the steps [here](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#enable-varnishncsa-logging). By default, Varnish logs are stored in `/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log`. For customized options, visit this [page](https://docs.varnish-software.com/tutorials/enabling-logging-with-varnishncsa/#step-3-customise-options-1).

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

### Step 1: Set up Collector

import SetupColl from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/set-up-collector.md';

### Step 2: Configure integration

OpenTelemetry works with a [configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) yaml file which has all the details with respect to the data which needs to be collected. For example, it specifies the location of a log file that is read and sent to the Sumo Logic platform.

In this step, you will configure the yaml required for Varnish Collection. You'll need to provide the path of the log file configured to capture Varnish logs.

The files are located in `/var/log/varnish/varnishncsa.log` by default. For more details, refer the the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section of this page. You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.
