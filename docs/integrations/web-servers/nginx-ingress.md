The Nginx Ingress app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health, and resource utilization of your Nginx Ingress web servers. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide insight into connections, requests, ingress controller metrics, visitor locations, visitor access types, traffic patterns, errors, web server operations, and access from known malicious sources.

This app is tested with the following Nginx Ingress versions:
* For Kubernetes environments: Nginx version 1.21.3

## Log and Metrics Types

The Sumo Logic app for Nginx Ingress assumes the NCSA extended/combined log file format for Access logs and the default Nginx error log file format for error logs.

All [Dashboards](#viewing-nginx-ingress-dashboards) (except the Error logs Analysis dashboard) assume the Access log format. The Error logs Analysis Dashboard assumes both Access and Error log formats, so as to correlate information between the two.

For more details on Nginx logs, see [Module ngx_http_log_module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html).

The Sumo Logic app for Nginx Ingress assumes Prometheus format Metrics for Requests, Connections, and Ingress controller.

For more details on Nginx Ingress Metrics, see [Prometheus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/logging-and-monitoring/prometheus/).


## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Nginx Ingress

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Nginx Ingress.

In a Kubernetes environment, we use our Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about this [here](/docs/observability/kubernetes/collection-setup).

Configuring log and metric collection for the Nginx Ingress app includes the following tasks:

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring the collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields).

If you're using Nginx Ingress in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:

* `pod_labels_component`
* `pod_labels_environment`
* `pod_labels_webserver_system`
* `pod_labels_webserver_farm`


### Step 2: Configure Nginx Ingress Logs and Metrics Collection

Sumo Logic supports the collection of logs and metrics data from Nginx Ingress in Kubernetes environments.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version if not please upgrade using the instructions [here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes).
:::

1. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest metrics, you must enable the Prometheus metrics in the Nginx Ingress controller and annotate the Nginx Ingress pods, so Prometheus can find the Nginx Ingress metrics. For instructions on Nginx Open Source, refer to [this documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/logging-and-monitoring/prometheus/).
2. Ensure you have deployed the [Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection), to send the logs and metrics to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, [visit here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes/install-helm-chart). Once deployed, logs will automatically be picked up and sent by default. Prometheus will scrape the Nginx Ingress pods, based on the annotations set in Step 1, for the metrics. Logs and Metrics will automatically be sent to the respective [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) instances, which consistently tag your logs and metrics, then forward them to your Sumo Logic org.
3. Apply following labels to the Nginx Ingress pod.
  ```sql
  environment="prod_CHANGEME"
  component="webserver"
    webserver_system="nginx_ingress"
    webserver_farm="<farm_CHANGEME>"
  ```
  Enter in values for the following parameters (marked in bold and **`CHANGE_ME`** above):
     * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the Nginx Ingress farm identified by the value of servers resides. For example:- dev, prod, or QA. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
     * `webserver_farm` - Enter a name to identify this Nginx Ingress farm. This farm name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards. If you haven’t defined a farm in Nginx Ingress, then enter ‘default’ for `webserver_farm`.

  **Do not modify** the following values set by this configuration as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
     * `component: “webserver”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
     * `webserver_system: “nginx_ingress”`. This value identifies the database system.
4. **Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments.** Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with `pod_labels`. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for Proxy Application Components. To do so:
   1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   2. Click the **+ Add** button on the top right of the table.
   3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear. Enter the following options:
     * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Webserver**.
     * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time.**
     * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data.**
     * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression.
      ```sql
        pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=webserver pod_labels_webserver_farm=* pod_labels_webserver_system=*
      ```
     * **Parse Expression**. Enter the following parse expression.
      ```sql
      if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
      | pod_labels_component as component
      | pod_labels_webserver_system as webserver_system
      | pod_labels_webserver_farm as webserver_farm
      ```

## Installing Nginx Ingress Monitors

After [setting up collection](/docs/integrations/web-servers/nginx-legacy), you can proceed to installing the Nginx Ingress monitors, app, and view examples of each of dashboard.
* To install these alerts, you need to have the Manage Monitors role capability.
* Alerts can be installed by either importing a JSON file or a Terraform script.

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled - for details, see the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts/monitors/monitor-faq.md).


### Method A: Import a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/nginx-ingress/nginxingress.json) that describes the monitors.
2. The JSON file contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all Nginx Ingress farms, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections. However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific farms or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `webserver_system=nginx_ingress` with `<Your Custom Filter>`. Custom filter examples:
   * For alerts applicable only to a specific farm, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=nginx-ingress.01`
   * For alerts applicable to all farms that start with `nginx-ingress`, your custom filter would be: `webserver_system=nginx-ingress*`
   * For alerts applicable to a specific farm within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=nginx-ingress-1` AND `environment=dev` (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)
3. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Click Import and then copy-paste the above JSON to import monitors.

The monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts using this method, navigate to the Nginx folder under **Monitors** to configure them. See [this](/docs/alerts/monitors) document to enable monitors to send notifications to teams or connections. See the instructions detailed in Step 4 of this [document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate a Sumo Logic access key and access ID for a user that has the Manage Monitors role capability in Sumo Logic using these[ instructions](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#manage-your-access-keys-on-preferences-page). Identify which deployment your Sumo Logic account is in, using this [link](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
2. [Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Nginx Ingress alerts: The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/Nginx%20Ingress). You can either download it through the “git clone” command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration: After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/Nginx Ingress.
   1. Edit the **nginx_ingress.auto.tfvars** file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id and Deployment from Step 1.
    ```sql
    access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
    access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
    environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
    ```
   The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific farms or environments, update the variable `nginx_ingress_data_source`. Custom filter examples:
      * A specific farm `webserver_farm=nginx.ingress.01`.
      * All farms in an environment `environment=dev`.
      * For alerts applicable to all farms that start with nginx ingress, your custom filter would be: `webserver_farm=nginx-ingress*`
      * For alerts applicable to a specific farm within a production environment, your custom filter would be: `webserver_system=nginx_ingress-1` and `environment=dev` (This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection)

All monitors are disabled by default on installation, if you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter **monitors_disabled** to **false** in this file.

By default, the monitors are configured in a monitor **folder** called “**Nginx Ingress**”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in “folder” key at nginx_ingress.auto.tfvars file.

5. If you would like the alerts to send email or connection notifications, modify the file nginx_ingress_notifications.auto.tfvars and populate `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` as per below examples.

```bash title="Pagerduty Connection Example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

Replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

For overriding payload for different connection types, refer to this [document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).

```bash title="Email Notifications Example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
      ]
```

6. **Install the Alerts**.
    1. Navigate to the package directory `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/**Nginx Ingress**/` and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
    2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors which will be created/modified by Terraform.
    3. Run `terraform apply`.
7. **Post Installation** If you haven’t enabled alerts and/or configured notifications through the Terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other users or services. This is detailed in Step 4 of [this document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).

These alerts are built based on logs and metrics datasets and have preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations. They are as follows:

| Alert Type (Metrics/Logs) | Alert Name | Alert Description | Trigger Type (Critical / Warning) | Alert Condition | Recover Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Logs | Nginx Ingress - Access from Highly Malicious Sources | This alert fires when an Nginx Ingress server is accessed from highly malicious IP addresses. | Critical | > 0 | < = 0 |
| Logs | Nginx Ingress - High Client (HTTP 4xx) Error Rate | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (>5%) with a response status of 4xx. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Logs | Nginx Ingress - High Server (HTTP 5xx) Error Rate | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (>5%) with a response status of 5xx. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Logs | Nginx Ingress - Critical Error Messages | This alert fires when we detect critical error messages for a given Nginx Ingress server. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
| Metrics | Nginx Ingress - Dropped Connections | This alert fires when we detect dropped connections for a given Nginx Ingress server. | Critical | > 0 | 0 |
