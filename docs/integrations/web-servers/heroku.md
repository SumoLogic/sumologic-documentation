Heroku is a platform that allows you to build cloud-based apps. The Sumo Logic app for Heroku is a logs-only app that allows you to monitor your Heroku environment. Our preconfigured dashboards present information to monitor Heroku infrastructure, applications, metrics, and error scenarios to ensure observability into Heroku and its components.

We offer an [add-on for Heroku](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/sumologic) that fully integrates Sumo Logic log analytics for Heroku users.

## Log types

* Heroku’s [Logplex logging service](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging) makes it easy to collect logs from its applications and forward them to Sumo Logic. We use an [HTTPS log drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains) to send [Syslog-formatted](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424#section-6) messages to an HTTPS endpoint via a POST request.
* The Heroku Labs [log-runtime-metrics](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-runtime-metrics) feature adds experimental support for enabling visibility into load and memory usage for running dynos.

## Sample log messages

* A Logplex POST body resembles the following.
  ```
  83 <40>1 2012-11-30T06:45:29+00:00 host app web.3 - State changed from starting to up
  119 <40>1 2012-11-30T06:45:26+00:00 host app web.3 - Starting process with command `bundle exec rackup config.ru -p 24405
  ```
* Runtime metric logs have the following format.
  ```
  335 <134>1 2023-08-24T10:28:47.153192+00:00 host heroku web.1 - source=web.1 dyno=heroku.322071457.63c5abfd-838b-4e2d-bce1-ce46de280675 sample#memory_total=180.43MB sample#memory_rss=180.05MB sample#memory_cache=0.38MB sample#memory_swap=0.00MB sample#memory_pgpgin=84329pages sample#memory_pgpgout=38140pages sample#memory_quota=512.00MB
  205 <134>1 2023-08-24T12:31:50.112+00:00 host heroku web.1 - source=web.1 dyno=heroku.319324155.67cc34d0-0440-4106-97b6-d9486f7d9009 sample#load_avg_1m=0.00 sample#load_avg_5m=0.00 sample#load_avg_15m=0.01
  ```

## Sample queries

#### Log queries

```sql title="Successful App Build Trend"
_sourceCategory="Heroku" "Build Succeeded"
| where _sourceName matches "{{log_drain}}"
| _sourceName as log_drain
| timeslice 5m

| transpose row _timeslice column log_drain
```

#### Metric log queries

```sql title="Memory Utilization (MB)"
_sourceCategory="Heroku"
| parse regex "dyno=(?<dyno>.*?(?= )).*memory_total=(?<memory_total>.*?(?=MB )).*memory_rss=(?<memory_rss>.*?(?=MB )).*memory_cache=(?<memory_cache>.*?(?=MB )).*memory_swap=(?<memory_swap>.*?(?=MB ))"
| where dyno matches "{{dyno}}" and _sourceName matches "{{log_drain}}"
| timeslice 5m
| avg(memory_total) as memory_total, avg(memory_rss) as resident_memory, avg(memory_cache) as disk_cache_memory, avg(memory_swap) as swap_memory by _timeslice
```

## Collecting logs for Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps in eight programming languages namely Node.js, Ruby, Python, Java, PHP, Go, Scala, and Clojure.

There are two ways to send Heroku logs to Sumo Logic.
* **[HTTPS Log Drain](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-drains#https-drains)**. A HTTPS Log Drain can be attached to a Heroku application via the CLI. It can be used to send logs to a [http logs source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) for any type of [Sumo Logic account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/) as per your requirement. The Sumo Logic Add-on internally wraps this method.
* **[Sumo Logic Add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/sumologic)**. The Sumo Logic add-on can be attached to a Heroku application via the CLI or the UI. It automatically creates a Sumo Logic free trial account that contains a [HTTPS logs source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) on a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).

:::note
We recommended attaching a Heroku add-on just after creating an app or running the `heroku create` command to help observe Heroku logs for all events that may follow for the app.
:::

### Collecting logs via HTTPS Log Drain

A HTTPS Log Drain can be attached to a Heroku application via the CLI.

1. Collect the **URL** of a [HTTPs logs source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics/) on a [hosted collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector/) in any [Sumo Logic account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/).
2. [Install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli) the Heroku CLI.
3. Add an HTTPS drain for an app named **myapp**:
    ```sh
    heroku drains:add <URL> -a myapp
    ```

You will now be able to see Heroku logs flowing into that HTTP source in Sumo Logic. You can also attach the same URL to multiple apps for a single log drain.

:::note
You can also run `heroku drains` or `heroku drains --json` command in your app directory to find the name of an existing Sumo Logic http source log_drain url of an app, which can be attached to a new app.
:::

### Collecting Logs via Sumo Logic add-on

The Sumo Logic add-on for Heroku helps you to monitor Heroku apps and harness the power of machine data with effortless log management that delivers business and operational insights within minutes.

#### Provisioning the Sumo Logic add-on via CLI

Provisioning the Sumo Logic add-on via the CLI allows us to monitor a single app as well as multiple apps using the same add-on. It creates a Sumo Logic free trial account for analyzing the Heroku logs. You would first need to [install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli) the Heroku CLI. The following sections show how to configure the add-on for Heroku apps.

##### Monitor a single app

For a single app, run the following command in your app directory.

```sh
heroku addons:create sumologic
-----> Adding sumologic to sharp-mountain-4005... done, v18 (free)
```

##### Monitor multiple apps

To monitor multiple applications, you can share the same Sumo Logic add-on with multiple applications.

1. Provision the add-on for your first application by running the following command in your app directory.
    ```sh
    heroku addons:create sumologic
    -----> Creating sumologic-test-horizontal-9854... done, (free)
    -----> Adding sumologic-test-horizontal-9854... done
    ```
2. Attach the add-on to your additional applications using the name of the add-on returned by the create command. Then run the following command in your app directory.
    ```sh
    heroku addons:attach sumologic-test-horizontal-9854
    -----> Attaching sumologic-test-horizontal-9854... done
    ```
    :::note
    You can also run `heroku drains` or `heroku drains --json` command in your app directory to find the name of an existing Sumo Logic add-on of an app which can be attached to a new app.
    :::
3. Run the following command in your app directory to access Sumo Logic.
    ```sh
    heroku addons:open sumologic
    Opening sumologic for sharp-mountain-4005
    ```

This opens up a Sumo Logic free trial account. Fill up the Sumo Logic onboarding form with the relevant details and click on **Get Started** to use Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic add-on for Heroku sets the value of `_sourceCategory` for your Heroku log data to **heroku**. It is recommended to use a single add-on for multiple applications.

#### Provisioning the Sumo Logic add-on via the UI

Provisioning the Sumo Logic add-on via the UI allows us to monitor a single app. The steps to do so are as follows:

1. Sign in to your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) to view information about your apps.
2. Click on an app to view an in-depth page about the app, which also shows all the **Installed add-ons** in the **Overview** tab.
3. Click on the **Configure Add-ons** and then search for **Sumo Logic**.
4. Click on the **Sumo Logic** add-on to open up a add-on order form.
5. Choose the **Plan name** and click on the **Submit Order Form** button.

You will now be able to see the **Sumo Logic** add-on in the **Installed add-ons** section of your app's **Overview** tab. Clicking on that add-on redirects you to open up a Sumo Logic free trial account, with a limited feature set, a daily data volume limit of 500MB per day, and 7 days of data retention. Fill up the Sumo Logic onboarding form with the relevant details and click on **Get Started** to use Sumo Logic. The Sumo Logic add-on for Heroku sets the value of **`_sourceCategory`** for your Heroku log data to **heroku**. Your application logs are automatically forwarded to this account. To monitor multiple applications, you can share the same Sumo Logic add-on with multiple applications.

There are two places you can access the Sumo Logic add-on for Heroku: from the Heroku application panel and the Sumo Logic UI, where you'll see a new Heroku navigation bar above the Sumo Logic main navigation bar. Otherwise, there are no other changes to Sumo Logic.

#### Limitations

Heroku users can use all Sumo Logic features associated with their account type, with a few exceptions.

All Heroku add-on user accounts are created as Sumo Logic administrators, but no user information or roles can be added or edited in Sumo. You can only log into Sumo Logic from the Heroku application panel. For this reason, you cannot change your password once your account is created, and as required by Heroku, you cannot log out of Sumo Logic once you have installed the add-on.

In addition, the following features are not supported:

* Allowlisting IP addresses
* Password Policies
* SAML

#### Heroku Support

All Sumo Logic add-on for Heroku support questions should be submitted to a [Heroku Support Channel](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/support-channels).  
 

## Collecting Metric Logs for Heroku

The Heroku Labs log-runtime-metrics feature adds experimental support for enabling visibility into load and memory usage for running dynos. Per-dyno stats on memory use, swap use, and load average are inserted into the app’s log stream where they can be seen via `heroku logs --tail`, used for graphs or alerting via an add-on which consumes app logs, or sent to a log drain. There is no cost incurred by enabling this feature.

Follow these steps to collect metric logs for an app.
1. Attach a log drain to the app. You can either attach a Sumo Logic add-on or a HTTPS log drain as explained in the [Collecting Logs for Heroku](#collecting-logs-for-heroku) section.
2. Enable the log-runtime-metrics.
    ```sh
    heroku labs:enable log-runtime-metrics --app example-app
    Enabling log-runtime-metrics for example-app... done
    heroku restart
    ```

The metric logs will start flowing into the Sumo Logic endpoint attached to your app. The load and memory usage metrics are surfaced as system logs in the Logplex log stream. Metrics are emitted for each running dyno, at an approximate frequency of once every 20 seconds.

Run the following command to disable this feature.
```sh
heroku labs:disable log-runtime-metrics --app example-app
Disabling log-runtime-metrics for example-app... done
heroku restart
```

## (Optional) Set up field extraction rules for applications

This step is optional, but recommended, as it makes easier for you to query your Heroku application logs in Sumo Logic. When Sumo Logic ingests Heroku application logs, it attaches the `_sourceName` metadata field to the the data. The `_sourceName` Sumo Logic assigns varies by application—its value is the unique identifier for the Logplex drain assigned to the application.

For ease of understanding the log data, you can use a **Field Extraction Rule (FER)** to rename `_sourceName` from the drain UUID to the application name. For general information about FERs, refer to the [Create a Field Extraction Rule](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/).

1. Determine the drain identifier by running the `heroku drains` command for your app. The identifier will look something like:
   ```
   d.98ee476d-d2d8-46bf-afc2-740f6f7e5b2a
   ```
2. Define an FER in Sumo Logic.
    1. In the Sumo Logic web app, go to **Manage Data > Settings > Field Extraction Rules**.
    2. Click the **+** in the upper left corner of the page to display the **Create Field Extraction Rule** popup.
        * **Rule Name**. Enter a name for the FER.
        * **Scope**. Enter `_sourceCategory=heroku` when the collection is setup via the Sumo Add-on.
        * **Parse Expression**. For each Heroku application reporting data to Sumo, enter a statement that renames the `_sourceName` from the drain ID to the application name. For example:

        ```sql
        if (_sourceName="Drain_ID", "Application_Name", _sourceName) as _sourceName
        ```

        The FER below changes the value of `_sourceName` for two applications. The first line changes `_sourceName` from “d.98ee476d-d2d8-46bf-afc2-740f6f7e5b2a” to “CustApp”. The second line changes `_sourceName` from “d.00870f28-53f9-4680-b2ab-2287ec9d8637” to “VendorApp”:
        ```sql
        if (_sourceName="d.98ee476d-d2d8-46bf-afc2-740f6f7e5b2a", "CustApp", _sourceName) as _sourceName
        | if (_sourceName="d.00870f28-53f9-4680-b2ab-2287ec9d8637", "VendorApp", _sourceName) as _sourceName
        ```
3. Click **Add** to save the rule.

These custom app `_sourceNames` will appear as values in the dashboard filter variable `log_drain` for the Heroku app dashboards.

## Installing the Heroku app

import AppInstall2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-v2.md';

<AppInstall2/>

:::note
While using the **Sumo Add-on**, the value `_sourceCategory=heroku` should be used while installing the app.

- **Resident Memory (memory_rss)**. The portion of the dyno’s memory (megabytes) held in RAM.
- **Disk Cache Memory (memory_cache)**. The portion of the dyno’s memory (megabytes) used as disk cache.
- **Swap Memory (memory_swap)**. The portion of a dyno’s memory, in megabytes, stored on disk. It’s normal for an app to use a few megabytes of swap per dyno. Higher levels of swap usage though may indicate too much memory usage when compared to the dyno size. This can lead to slow response times and should be avoided.
- **Total Memory (memory_total)**. The total memory (megabytes) being used by the dyno, equal to the sum of resident, cache, and swap memory.
- **Memory Quota (memory_quota)**. The resident memory (memory_rss) value (megabytes) at which an R14 is triggered.
- **Pages Written to Disk (memory_pgpgout)**. The cumulative total of the pages written to disk. Sudden high variations on this number can indicate short duration spikes in swap usage. The other memory related metrics are point in time snapshots and can miss short spikes.
- **Pages Read from Disk (memory_pgpgin)**. The cumulative total of the pages read from disk. As with the previous metric, watch out for sudden variations.

### CPU Load Metrics
