The Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus supports logs as well as Metrics for Nginx Plus, which is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy, and HTTP cache.

The Nginx Plus app is an unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, health and resource utilization of your Nginx Plus web servers. Preconfigured dashboards and searches provide insight into server status, location zones, server zones, upstreams, resolvers, visitor locations, visitor access types, traffic patterns, errors, web server operations and access from known malicious sources.

## Log and Metrics Types

The Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus assumes the NCSA extended/combined log file format for Access logs and the default Nginx error log file format for error logs.

All Dashboards (except the Error logs Analysis dashboard) assume the Access log format. The Error logs Analysis Dashboard assumes both Access and Error log formats, so as to correlate information between the two. For more details on Nginx/NginxPlus logs, see [Module ngx_http_log_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html).

The Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus assumes Prometheus format Metrics for Requests and Connections. For Nginx Plus Server metrics, API Module from Nginx Configuration is used. For more details on Nginx Plus Metrics, see [Module ngx_http_api_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html).

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for Nginx Plus

This section provides instructions for configuring log and metric collection for the Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus. Sumo Logic supports a collection of logs and metrics data from Nginx Plus in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Click on the appropriate links below based on the environment where your Nginx Plus servers are hosted.

### For Kubernetes environments

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about it [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from Nginx Plus in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/nginxk8s.png')} alt="Web servers" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from Nginx Plus. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment: i.e. Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the Nginx Plus input plugin to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

#### Collect Logs for Nginx Plus in Kubernetes environment

Nginx Plus app supports the default access logs and error logs format.

1. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must configure the logging of errors and processed requests in NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. For instructions, refer to the [Ngnix Plus Configuring Logging documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/logging-and-monitoring/).
2. Use the Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, to send the logs to Sumologic. For more information, [visit](/docs/observability/kubernetes/collection-setup).
3. Identifying the logs metadata: For example, to get **Logs** data from the pod, you can use the following source `_sourceCategory = "kubernetes/default/nginx"` where `kubernetes` is Cluster name, `default` is Namespace, `nginx` is application.
4. To get log data from Nginx Pods - all nginx logs must be redirected to standard output “**stdout**” and standard error “**stderr**”.


#### Collect Metrics for Nginx Plus in Kubernetes environment  

Nginx Plus app supports the metrics for Nginx Plus.

The following steps assume you are collecting Nginx Plus metrics from a Kubernetes environment. In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more about this[ here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture).

1. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest metrics, you must enable the API module to expose metrics in NGINX Plus.
    * For instructions on Nginx Plus, refer to the following documentation [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/live-activity-monitoring/](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/monitoring/live-activity-monitoring/).
    * Make a note of the URL where the API is exposed. It will match the format like [https://localhost:8080/api](https://localhost:8080/api).
2. [Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator.](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf)
3. On your Nginx Plus Pods, add the following annotations to configure Telegraf.
   ```sql
   annotations:
        telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
        [[inputs.nginx_plus_api]]
           urls = ["http://localhost:8080/api"]
           response_timeout = "5s"
           api_version = 6
        telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/port: "9273"
   ```
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf Nginx Plus Input plugin. Please refer [to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx_plus_api) for more information on configuring the Nginx input plugin for Telegraf. Note since telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`. This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`. This tells Prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

### For Non-Kubernetes environments

We use the Telegraf operator for Nginx Plus metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting Nginx Plus logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the Nginx Plus collection in a non-Kubernetes environment.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/nginxplus-nonk8s.png')} alt="nginxplus-nonk8s" />

Telegraf runs on the same system as Nginx Plus, and uses the [Nginx Plus input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx_plus_api) to obtain Nginx Plus metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from Nginx on the other hand are sent to either a Sumo Logic Local File source.

#### Collect Logs for Nginx Plus in Non-Kubernetes environment

Nginx Plus app supports the default access logs and error logs format.

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus. Follow the instructions below to set up the Log collection.

1. **Configure logging in Nginx**. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest logs, you must configure the logging of errors and processed requests in NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. For instructions, refer to the following documentation: [https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/logging-and-monitoring/](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/logging-and-monitoring/)
2. **Configure a Collector**. Use one of the following Sumo Logic Collector options:
   * To collect logs directly from the Nginx Plus machine, configure an [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
   * If you're using a service like Fluentd, or you would like to upload your logs manually, [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector.md).
3. **Configure a Source**. Choose a method:

<details>
<summary>For an Installed Collector</summary>

To collect logs directly from your Nginx Plus machine, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source.

1. Add a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
    * **Name.** (Required)
    * **Description.** (Optional)
    * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in `/var/log/nginx/*.log`. If you're using a customized path, check the nginx.conf file for this information. If you're using Passenger, you may have instructed Passenger to log to a specific log using the passenger_log_file option.
    * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
    * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Nginx/Access** or **Nginx/Error**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
    * **Time Zone.** Automatically detect.
    * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
    * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
    * **Enable Multiline Processing.**
        * **Error logs.** Select **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** and **Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically**.
        * **Access logs.** These are single-line logs, uncheck **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**.
4. Click **Save**.

</details>

<details>
<summary>For a Hosted Collector</summary>

If you're using a service like Fluentd, or you would like to upload your logs manually, use a Hosted Collector and an HTTP Source.

1. Add an[ HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).
2. Configure the HTTP Source fields as follows:
    * **Name.** (Required)
    * **Description.** (Optional)
    * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different hostname.
    * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Nginx/Access** or **Nginx/Error**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    * **Time Zone.** For Access logs, use the time zone from the log file. For Error logs, make sure to select the correct time zone.
    * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing.**
        * **Error** **logs**: Select **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** and **Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically**.
        * **Access** **logs**: These are single-line logs, uncheck **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**.
4. Click **Save**.
5. When the URL associated with the HTTP Source is displayed, copy the URL so you can add it to the service you are using, such as Fluentd.

</details>

#### Collect Metrics for Nginx Plus in Non-Kubernetes environment

Nginx Plus app supports the metrics for Nginx Plus.

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for Nginx Plus. Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection.

1. **Configure Metrics in Nginx Plus**. Before you can configure Sumo Logic to ingest metrics, you must enable API module to expose metrics in NGINX Plus.
   * The live activity monitoring data is generated by the [NGINX Plus API](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html). Visit [live activity monitoring](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/live-activity-monitoring/) to configure the API module.
   * Make a note of the URL where the API is exposed. It will match the format like[ http://localhost/api](https://127.0.0.1:8080/nginx_status).
2. **Configure a Hosted Collector**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#create-a-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
3. **Configure a Metrics Source**. Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the HTTP Source URL.
4. **Install Telegraf**. Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md#install-telegraf-in-a-non-kubernetes-environment) to install Telegraf.
5. **Configure and start Telegraf**. Create a file called telegraf.conf and add the appropriate configuration. The following is a basic example:
```sql
[agent]
  interval = "60s"
-- Read Nginx Plus full API information (ngx_http_api_module)
[[inputs.nginx_plus_api]]
-- An array of Nginx Plus API URLs to gather stats.
 urls = ["http://localhost/api"]
-- HTTP response timeout (default: 5s)
 response_timeout = "5s"
-- Nginx Plus API version, default: 3
 api_version = 6
[[outputs.sumologic]]
  url = "<URL Created in Step 3>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```

* `interval` - This is the frequency to send data to Sumo Logic, in this example, we will send the metrics every 60 seconds. Please refer to [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
* `urls` - The url to the Nginx Plus server with the API enabled. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple Nginx Plus servers. Please refer [to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/nginx_plus_api) for more information on configuring the Nginx API input plugin for Telegraf.
* `url` - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 3. Please refer[ to this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
* `data_format` - The format to use when sending data to Sumo Logic. Please refer[ to this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.
6. Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can run the following command to start telegraf.
  ```bash
  telegraf --config /path/to/telegraf.conf
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Field Extraction Rules

Field Extraction Rules (FERs) tell Sumo Logic which fields to parse out automatically. For instructions, on creating them, see [Create a Field Extraction Rule](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

Nginx assumes the NCSA extended/combined log file format for Access logs and the default Nginx error log file format for error logs.

Both the parse expressions can be used for logs collected from Nginx Plus Server running on Local or container-based systems.

For **FER for Access Logs**, use the following Parse Expression:

```
| json field=_raw "log" as nginx_log_message nodrop
| if (isEmpty(nginx_log_message), _raw, nginx_log_message) as nginx_log_message
| parse regex field=nginx_log_message "(?<Client_Ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
| parse regex field=nginx_log_message "(?<Method>[A-Z]+)\s(?<URL>\S+)\sHTTP/[\d\.]+\
"\s(?<Status_Code>\d+)\s(?<Size>[\d-]+)\s\"(?<Referrer>.*?)\"\s\"(?<User_Agent>.+?)\".*"
```

For **FER for Error Logs**, use the following Parse Expression:

```sql
| json field=_raw "log" as nginx_log_message nodrop
| if (isEmpty(nginx_log_message), _raw, nginx_log_message) as nginx_log_message
| parse regex field=nginx_log_message "\s\[(?<Log_Level>\S+)\]\s\d+#\d+:\s(?:\*\d+\s|)(?<Message>[A-Za-z][^,]+)(?:,|$)"
| parse field=nginx_log_message "client: *, server: *, request: \"* * HTTP/1.1\", host:
\"*\"" as Client_Ip, Server, Method, URL, Host nodrop
```

## Installing Nginx Plus Monitors

To install these alerts, you need to have the [Manage Monitors](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities) role capability.

Alerts can be installed by either importing them via a JSON or via a Terraform script.

### Method A: Importing a JSON file

1. Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/nginx-plus/nginxplus.json) describing all the monitors.
2. Replace **$$logs_data_source** and **$$metric_data_source** with logs and metrics data sources respectively. For example, `_sourceCategory=Labs/Nginx/Plus/Logs`.
3. Go to Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Click **Import** to import monitors from the JSON above.

:::note
The monitors are disabled by default. Once you have installed the alerts via this method, navigate to the **Nginx Plus** folder under **Monitors** to configure them. Refer to [this document](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor) to enable monitors, to configure each monitor, to send notifications to teams or connections.
:::


### Method B: Using a Terraform script

1. Generate a Sumo Logic [access key](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#create-an-access-keyon-preferences-page) and access ID for a user that has the [Manage Monitors](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities) role capability in Sumo Logic using these instructions. Please identify your Sumo Logic [deployment](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
2. [Download and install Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for Nginx Plus alerts. The alerts package is available in the Sumo Logic GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages/nginx-plus). You can either download it via the “git clone” command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration: After the package has been extracted, navigate to the package directory `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/nginx-plus/`. Edit the **nginxplus.auto.tfvars** file as per the below instructions:
   * Add your Sumo Logic Access Key, Access Id, and Deployment from Step 1.
     ```sql
     access_id  = "<YOUR SUMO ACCESS ID>"
     access_key = "<YOUR SUMO ACCESS KEY>"
     environment = "<DEPLOYMENT>"
     ```
   * Add the data source values.
     * **Metric_data_source** - Sumo Logic data source for nginx plus metrics.
     * **Logs_data_source** - Sumo Logic data source for logs.
   * All monitors are disabled by default on installation. If you would like to enable all the monitors, set the parameter `monitors_disabled` to `false`.
   * All monitors are configured in a monitor folder called “**Nginx Plus**”, if you would like to change the name of the folder, update the parameter **folder**.
5. Email and Connection Notification Configuration Examples: Modify the file **nginxplus.auto.tfvars** and populate `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` as per the below examples.
   ```bash title="Pagerduty Connection Example"
   connection_notifications = [
       {
         connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
         connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
         payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       },
       {
         connection_type       = "Webhook",
         connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
         payload_override      = "",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       }
     ]
   ```
   * Replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection id of the webhook connection. The webhook connection id can be retrieved via calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections). For overriding payload for different connection types, refer to this [document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).
   ```bash title="Email Notifications Example"
   email_notifications = [
       {
         connection_type       = "Email",
         recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
         subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
         time_zone             = "PST",
         message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
         run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
6. Install the Alerts:
   1. Navigate to the package directory **terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/nginx-plus/** and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and will download the required components.
   2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors resources which will be created/modified by Terraform.
   3. Run `terraform apply`.
7. Post Installation steps: If you haven’t enabled alerts and/or configured notifications via the terraform procedure outlined above, we highly recommend enabling alerts of interest and configuring each enabled alert to send notifications to other people or services. This is detailed in [Step 4](/docs/alerts/monitors#add-a-monitor).

There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled. See the [Alerts FAQ](/docs/alerts).
