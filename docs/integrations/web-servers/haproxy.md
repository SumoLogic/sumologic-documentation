HAProxy is open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications that spreads requests across multiple servers.

The Sumo Logic app for HAProxy is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, and health of your HAProxy cluster. Preconfigured dashboards provide insights into active servers, visitor locations, sessions, errors, response time, and throughput.

## HAProxy log types  

The app supports Logs and Metrics from the open source version of HAProxy. The app is tested on the 2.3.9 version of HAProxy.

The HAProxy logs are generated in files as configured in the configuration file /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg ([learn more](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-logging/)).

The Sumo Logic app for HAProxy supports metrics generated by the [HAProxy plugin for Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/haproxy). The app assumes prometheus format Metrics.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for HAProxy

This section provides instructions for configuring logs and metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for HAProxy.

Configuring log and metric collection for the HAProxy app includes the following tasks:

### Step 1: Configure Fields in Sumo Logic

Create the following Fields in Sumo Logic prior to configuring collection. This ensures that your logs and metrics are tagged with relevant metadata, which is required by the app dashboards. For information on setting up fields, see [Sumo Logic Fields](/docs/manage/fields).

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

If you're using HAProxy in a Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
  * `pod_labels_component`
  * `pod_labels_environment`
  * `pod_labels_proxy_system`
  * `pod_labels_proxy_cluster`

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-k8s">

If you're using HAProxy in a non-Kubernetes environment, create the fields:
  * `component`
  * `environment`
  * `proxy_system`
  * `proxy_cluster`
  * `pod`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Step 2: Configure Collection for HAProxy

Sumo Logic supports collection of logs and metrics data from HAProxy in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments.

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In **Kubernetes environments**, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection ([learn more](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture)). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from HAProxy in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/haproxy-k8s.png')} alt="haproxy k8s flow" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from HAProxy. Note that we’re running Telegraf in each pod we want to collect metrics from as a sidecar deployment for example, Telegraf runs in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the HAProxy input plugin to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector), which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.

:::note Prerequisites
It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes).

#### Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect HAProxy metrics from a Kubernetes environment. In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. You can learn more on this [here](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). Follow the steps listed below to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

1. On your HAProxy Pods, add the following annotations:
```sql
annotations:
    telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "9273"
    telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
[[inputs.haproxy]]
  servers = ["http://127.0.0.1:1024/stats"]
  [inputs.haproxy.tags]
    environment="dev_CHANGEME"
    component="proxy"
    proxy_system="haproxy"
    proxy_cluster="haproxy_on_k8s_CHANGEME"
```
2. Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):
   * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf HAProxy Input plugin. See[ this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the HAProxy input plugin for Telegraf. As telegraf will be run as a sidecar, the host should always be localhost.
   * In the input plugins section:
      * `servers`. The URL to the HAProxy server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple HAProxy servers. See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/haproxy) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the HAProxy input plugin for Telegraf.
      * In the tags section `[inputs.haproxy.tags]`
        * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the HAProxy cluster identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `proxy_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this HAProxy cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

    :::warning Do not modify the other values
    Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to function incorrectly
     * `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`. Instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use.
     * `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. Ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
     * `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`  - Tells prometheus what ports to scrape on.
     * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. In the tags section, for example: `[inputs.haproxy.tags]`
     * `component: “proxy”`.  Used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
     * `proxy_system: “haproxy”` - Identifies the proxy system.
    :::

   For all other parameters, please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
3. Kubernetes collection will start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect HAProxy logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. Add labels on your HAProxy pods to capture logs from standard output (`stdout`) on Kubernetes:
  ```sql
  labels:
    environment: "prod"
    component: "proxy"
    proxy_system: "haproxy"    
        proxy_cluster: "haproxy_prod_cluster01"
  ```
2. Enter in values for the following parameters:
   * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the HAProxy cluster identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
   * `proxy_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this HAProxy cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

   :::warning Do not modify the other values
   Do not modify the other values
   Modifying these values will cause the Sumo Logic apps to function incorrectly
    * `component: “proxy”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
    * `proxy_system: “haproxy”`. This value identifies the proxy system.
   :::

   For all other parameters see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#Configuring-Telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.
3. Collecting HAProxy Logs from a Log File (Optional). Follow the steps below to capture HAProxy logs from a log file on Kubernetes.
  1. Determine the location of the HAProxy log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the HAProxy.conf for your HAProxy cluster along with the mounts on the HAProxy pods.
  2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
  3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
   ```xml
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_Haproxy_log_file>/<Haproxy_log_file_name>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/var/log//haproxy.log
   ```
  4. Make sure that the HAProxy pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
   ```xml
   kubectl describe pod <haproxy_pod_name>
   ```
  5. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
3. Add an FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with `pod_labels`. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for Proxy Application Components. To do so:
   1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**.
   2. Click the + Add button on the top right of the table.
   3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear.
   4. Enter the following options:
    * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Proxy**.
    * **Applied At.** Choose **Ingest Time**
    * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
    * **Scope**: Enter the following keyword search expression:  
    ```sql
    pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=proxy pod_labels_proxy_system=* pod_labels_proxy_cluster=*
    ```
    * **Parse Expression**. Enter the following parse expression:
    ```sql
    | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
    | pod_labels_component as component
    | pod_labels_proxy_system as proxy_system
    | pod_labels_proxy_cluster as proxy_cluster
    ```
   5. Click **Save** to create the rule.

<TabItem value="non-k8s">

We use the Telegraf operator for HAProxy metric collection and Sumo Logic Installed Collector for collecting HAProxy logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the HAProxy collection in a **non-Kubernetes** environment. Telegraf runs on the same system as HAProxy, and uses the [HAProxy input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/haproxy) to obtain HAProxy metrics, and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from HAProxy on the other hand are sent to either a Sumo Logic Local File source or Syslog source.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/HAProxy-nonk8s.png')} alt="Backend dashboard" />

This section provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for the Sumo Logic app for HAProxy.

#### Configure Metrics Collection

1. Configure a Hosted Collector: To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the[Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#create-a-hosted-collector) section of the Sumo Logic documentation.
2. Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source: Create a new HTTP Logs and Metrics Source in the hosted collector created above by following[ these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the **HTTP Source URL**.
3. Install Telegraf using [these steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md).
4. Configure and start Telegraf: As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the [HAProxy input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/haproxy) to get data from Telegraf and the [Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/outputs/sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.  

Create or modify telegraf.conf, and copy and paste the text below:
```sql
[[inputs.Haproxy]]
  username = "username_CHANGEME"
  password = "password_CHANGEME"
  servers = ["http://127.0.0.1:8888/stats"]
  [inputs.haproxy.tags]
    environment="dev_CHANGME"
    component="proxy"
    proxy_system="haproxy"
    proxy_cluster="haproxy_on_premise_CHANGEME"
[[outputs.sumologic]]
  url = "<URL Created in Step 3>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```

Please enter values for the following parameters (marked `CHANGEME` above):

* In the input plugins section, that is `[[inputs.haproxy]]`:
    * `servers` - The URL to the HAProxy server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple HAProxy servers. Please see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/haproxy) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the HAProxy input plugin for Telegraf.
    * In the tags section, `[inputs.haproxy.tags]`:
        * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the HAProxy server identified by the value of `servers` resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
        * `proxy_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this HAProxy cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
    * **`url`** - This is the HTTP source URL created in step 2. Please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/configure-telegraf-output-plugin.md) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

    **Do not modify** the following values set by this Telegraf configuration as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.

* `data_format - “prometheus”` In the output plugins section, that is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic.
* `proxy_system: “haproxy”` - In the input plugins section: `[[inputs.Haproxy]]` - This value identifies the proxy system.
* `component: “proxy”`.  In the input plugins section: This value identifies application components.

For all other parameters, see [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

Once you have finalized your telegraf.conf file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from the [doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, HAProxy metrics should start flowing into Sumo Logic.

#### Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for HAProxy running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic app for HAProxy.

By default, HAProxy logs are forwarded to Syslog. Configuration in the file **/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg** can be modified to send logs to files.

Sumo Logic supports collecting logs both via Syslog and a local log file. Utilizing Sumo Logic [Cloud Syslog](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source) will require TCP TLS Port 6514 to be open in your network. Local log files can be collected via [Installed collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) which will require you to allow outbound traffic to [Sumo Logic endpoints](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for collection to work. For detailed requirements for Installed collectors, see this [page](/docs/get-started/system-requirements#Installed-Collector-Requirements).

Based on your infrastructure and networking setup, choose one of these methods to collect HAProxy logs and follow the instructions below to set up log collection:

1. Configure logging in HAProxy
2. Configure local log file or syslog collection
3. Configure a Collector
4. Configure a Source
5. Configure logging in HAProxy: Haproxy supports logging via following methods: syslog, local text log files and stdout. Haproxy logs have six levels of verbosity. To select a level, set loglevel to one of:
   * **emerg** - Errors such as running out of operating system file descriptors.
   * **alert** - Some rare cases where something unexpected has happened, such as being unable to cache a response
   * **info** - TCP connection and http request details and errors
   * **err** - Errors such as being unable to parse a map file, being unable to parse the HAProxy configuration file, and when an operation on a stick table fails
   * **warning** - Certain important, but non-critical, errors such as failing to set a request header or failing to connect to a DNS nameserver
   * **notice** - Changes to a server’s state, such as being UP or DOWN or when a server is disabled. Other events at startup, such as starting proxies and loading modules are also included. Health check logging, if enabled, also uses this level)
   * **debug** (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)

    All logging settings are located in [Haproxy.conf](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-logging/).

    For the dashboards to work properly, must set log format:
   ```bash
   %ci:%cp\ [%tr]\ %ft\ %b/%s\ %TR/%Tw/%Tc/%Tr/%Ta\ %ST\ %B\ %CC\ %CS\ %tsc\ %ac/%fc/%bc/%sc/%rc\ %sq/%bq\ %hr\ %hs\ %{+Q}r
   ```
6. Configure Haproxy log to a Local file or syslog:

    **Configuring HAProxy logs to stream via syslog (Recommended)**

    You can enable HAProxy logs to syslog by adding the following line in the **global** section of `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` file.


```bash
global
   log 127.0.0.1:514  local0
defaults
       log global
```

    The **log** directive instructs HAProxy to send logs to the Syslog server listening at 127.0.0.1:514.


    The **log global** directive basically says, use the log line that was set in the **global** section. Putting a **log global** directive into the **defaults** section is equivalent to putting it into all of the subsequent proxy sections.


Keep the **port(514)** handy as we will use it in next steps.

**Configuring HAProxy logs to go to log files**

Follow the steps below to enable HAProxy logs to go to log files:

1. You can enable HAProxy logs to syslog by adding the following line in the **global** section of **/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg** file. This means that HAProxy will send its messages to rsyslog on 127.0.0.1.
   ```bash
   global
      log 127.0.0.1  local2
   defaults
              log global
   ```
1. By default, rsyslog doesn’t listen to any address. Uncomment or add following lines in **/etc/rsyslog.conf.** This will make rsyslog listen on UDP port 514 for all IP addresses.
   ```bash
   $ModLoad imudp
           $UDPServerRun 514
   ```
1. Now create a **/etc/rsyslog.d/haproxy.conf** file containing below lines.
   ```bash
   local2.*    /var/log/haproxy.log
   ```
   You can of course be more specific and create separate log files according to the level of messages:
   ```bash
   local2.=info     /var/log/haproxy-info.log
   local2.=notice     /var/log/haproxy-notice.log
   ```
1. Restart HAProxy and rsyslog server to enforce configuration changes.
1. Verify that the files are created in **/var/log** location.
1. Configuring a Collector: To add an Installed collector, perform the steps as defined on the page [Configure an Installed Collector.](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors)
1. Configuring a Source:
   * **To add a Syslog Source source for HAProxy, do the following**
      1. Add a [Syslog source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/syslog-source) in the installed collector configured in the previous step.
      2. Configure the Syslog Source fields as follows:
          * **Name.** (Required)
          * **Description.** (Optional)
          * **Protocol.** UDP
          * **Port.** 514 (as entered while configuring logging in Step b.)
          * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Haproxy/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
          * **Fields.** Set the following fields:
              * `component = proxy`
              * `proxy_system = haproxy`
              * `proxy_cluster = <Your_Haproxy_Cluster_Name>`
              * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod.
      3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
          * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
          * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your HAProxy Server’s time zone.
          * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
          * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
      4. Click **Save**.
   * **To add a Local File Source for HAProxy do the following.**
      1. Add a[ Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
      2. Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
          * **Name.** (Required)
          * **Description.** (Optional)
          * **File Path (Required).** Enter the path to your error.log or access.log. The files are typically located in /var/log/haproxy*.log. If you're using a customized path, check the haproxy.conf file for this information.
          * **Source Host.** Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name.
          * **Source Category.** Enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source, such as **Haproxy/Logs**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see[ Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
          * **Fields.** Set the following fields:
              * `component = proxy`
              * `proxy_system = haproxy`
              * `proxy_cluster = <Your_Haproxy_Cluster_Name>`
              * `environment = <Environment_Name>`, such as Dev, QA or Prod.
1. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
    * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from log file and instead use**, and then select your HAProxy Server’s time zone.
    * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
    * **Encoding.** Select UTF-8 (Default).
    * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
        * Infer Boundaries - Detect message boundaries automatically
    * Click **Save.**

Verify logs are flowing into Sumo Logic by running the following logs query:
```sql
component="proxy" proxy_cluster="<Your-HAProxy-Server>" proxy_system="haproxy"
```

## Installing the HAProxy Monitors

Sumo Logic has provided pre-packaged alerts available through [Sumo Logic monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) to help you proactively determine if a HAProxy cluster is available and performing as expected. These monitors are based on metric and log data and include pre-set thresholds that reflect industry best practices and recommendations. For more information about individual alerts, see [HAProxy Alerts](#haproxy-alerts).

To install these monitors, you must have the **Manage Monitors** role capability. You can install by importing a JSON file or using a Terraform script.

:::note
There are limits to how many alerts can be enabled. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors#rules) for details.
:::

### Method A: Import a JSON file

Download the [JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/haproxy/haproxy.json) that describes the monitors. The [JSON](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/blob/main/monitor_packages/haproxy/haproxy.json) contains the alerts that are based on Sumo Logic searches that do not have any scope filters and therefore will be applicable to all HAProxy clusters, the data for which has been collected via the instructions in the previous sections.  

However, if you would like to restrict these alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the JSON file by replacing the text `proxy_cluster=*` with `<Your Custom Filter>`. Custom filter examples:
* For alerts applicable only to a specific cluster, your custom filter would be: `proxy_cluster=dev-haproxy01`
* For alerts applicable to all clusters that start with `haproxy-prod`: `proxy_cluster=haproxy-prod*`
* For alerts applicable to a specific cluster within a production environment: `proxy_cluster=dev-haproxy01` AND `environment=prod`. This assumes you have set the optional environment tag while configuring collection.

1. Go to **Manage Data > Alerts > Monitors**.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Click Import.
4. On the **Import Content popup**, enter **HAProxy** in the Name field, paste in the JSON into the the popup, and click **Import**.
5. The monitors are created in a "HAProxy" folder. The monitors are disabled by default. See the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) topic for information about enabling monitors and configuring notifications or connections.

### Method 2: Use a Terraform script

1. Generate an access key and access ID for a user that has the **Manage Monitors** role capability. For instructions see [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key_on_Preferences_page).
2. Download [Terraform 0.13](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) or later, and install it.
3. Download the Sumo Logic Terraform package for HAProxy monitors. The alerts package is available in the [Sumo Logic GitHub repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/tree/main/monitor_packages). You can either download it using the git clone command or as a zip file.
4. Alert Configuration. After extracting the package, navigate to the terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/haproxy/ directory. Edit the haproxy.auto.tfvars file and add the Sumo Logic Access Key and Access ID from Step 1 and your Sumo Logic deployment. If you're not sure of your deployment, see [Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).
```sql
access_id   = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS ID>"
access_key  = "<SUMOLOGIC ACCESS KEY>"
environment = "<SUMOLOGIC DEPLOYMENT>"
```

The Terraform script installs the alerts without any scope filters, if you would like to restrict the alerts to specific clusters or environments, update the `haproxy_data_source` variable. For example:
* To configure alerts for A specific cluster, set `haproxy_data_source` to something like `proxy_cluster=haproxy.prod.01`
* To configure alerts for All clusters in an environment, set `haproxy_data_source` to something like `environment=prod`
* To configure alerts for Multiple clusters using a wildcard, set `haproxy_data_source` to something like `proxy_cluster=haproxy-prod*`
* To configure alerts for A specific cluster within a specific environment, set `haproxy_data_source` to something like `proxy_cluster=haproxy-1` and `environment=prod`. This assumes you have configured and applied Fields as described in [Step 1: Configure Fields of the Sumo Logic of the Collect Logs and Metrics for HAProxy](#step-1-configure-fields-in-sumo-logic).

All monitors are disabled by default on installation. To enable all of the monitors, set the `monitors_disabled` parameter to false.

By default, the monitors will be located in a "HAProxy" folder on the **Monitors** page. To change the name of the folder, update the monitor folder name in the folder variable in the `haproxy.auto.tfvars` file.

5. If you want the alerts to send email or connection notifications, edit the `haproxy_notifications.auto.tfvars` file to populate the `connection_notifications` and `email_notifications` sections. Examples are provided below.

In the variable definition below, replace `<CONNECTION_ID>` with the connection ID of the Webhook connection. You can obtain the Webhook connection ID by calling the [Monitors API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listConnections).

```bash title="Pagerduty connection example"
connection_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "PagerDuty",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "{\"service_key\": \"your_pagerduty_api_integration_key\",\"event_type\": \"trigger\",\"description\": \"Alert: Triggered {{TriggerType}} for Monitor {{Name}}\",\"client\": \"Sumo Logic\",\"client_url\": \"{{QueryUrl}}\"}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    },
    {
      connection_type       = "Webhook",
      connection_id         = "<CONNECTION_ID>",
      payload_override      = "",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

For information about overriding the payload for different connection types, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).

```bash title="Email notifications example"
email_notifications = [
    {
      connection_type       = "Email",
      recipients            = ["abc@example.com"],
      subject               = "Monitor Alert: {{TriggerType}} on {{Name}}",
      time_zone             = "PST",
      message_body          = "Triggered {{TriggerType}} Alert on {{Name}}: {{QueryURL}}",
      run_for_trigger_types = ["Critical", "ResolvedCritical"]
    }
  ]
```

6. Installing Monitors:
   1. Navigate to the `terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor/monitor_packages/haproxy/` directory and run `terraform init`. This will initialize Terraform and download the required components.
   2. Run `terraform plan` to view the monitors that Terraform will create or modify.
   3. Run `terraform apply`.
