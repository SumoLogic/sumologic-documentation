This page demonstrates how to install the Google Workspace App and enable documents shared outside your organization. This page also provides descriptions, use cases, and examples for each of the Google Workspace App dashboards.


## Installing the Google Workspace App

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

To install the app, do the following:

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the **Google Workspace** app.
2. Click **Add to Library** and complete the following fields:
   * **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.â€¨
   * Select either of the following options for the **Google Workspace App Audit Log source:**
      * **Source Category,** and select the Source Category from the list.
      * **Enter a Custom Data Filter,** and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (_sourceCategory=google_app*).
   * If you have not already, and do not intend to collect Google Workspace Alert Center logs, leave the Source Category in the Google Workspace App Alert Center Log source as blank. Otherwise, select one of the following options for the **Google** **Workspace App Alert Center Log source:**
     * **Source Category,** and select the Source Category from the list.
     * **Enter a Custom Data Filter,** and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=workspace_alerts`).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/google-workspace-app.png')} alt="Google Workspace app" />
3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or another folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization. See [Welcome to the New Library](/docs/get-started/library) for information on working with the library in the new UI.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

### Enable the Documents Shared Outside of Organization panel

Add your domain in the query in the highlighted section shown below. Click **Update Dashboard** to save the query. Now, you can see your data in the panel.
