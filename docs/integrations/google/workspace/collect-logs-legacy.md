:::note legacy
For the newer method of collecting logs from Google Workspace Alert Center, configure a [Google Alert Workspace Alert Center Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/google-workspace-alertcenter.md).
:::

This section explains how to collect logs from Google Workspace Alert Center and ingest them into Sumo Logic for use with the Google Workspace App predefined dashboards and searches.

[Google Workspace Alert Center](#configure-collection-for-google-workspace-alert-center): Provides full visibility into alerts from Google Workspace apps, allowing you to investigate and correlate alerts and monitor potential threats. You can configure the list alerts to be collected. The alerts are forwarded to Sumo Logic’s HTTP endpoint in JSON format.

## Alert types

All the alerts are in JSON format. Most of the alerts have few common fields like alertId, customerId, createTime, source, type and data. The differences are in the data section of the JSON where the alert type specific details are recorded. For more information about different alert types refer this Google Workspace [Alert document](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/reference/alert-types).


## Sample log messages

This section provides a sample Google Workspace Alert Center log message.

```json
{
 "alertId": "2b49ec18-2f92-4d58-acca-45994b740848",
 "createTime": "TIMESTAMP",
 "customerId": "03gm7p8e",
 "data": {
   "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.apps.alertcenter.type.DomainWideTakeoutInitiated",
   "takeoutRequestId": "unique9gfd87ss",
   "email": "john@alertcenter1.bigr.name"
 },
 "deleteTime": "TIMESTAMP",
 "endTime": "TIMESTAMP",
 "metadata": {
   "alertId": "2b49ec18-2f92-4d58-acca-45994b740848",
   "customerId": "03gm7p8e",
   "status": "NOT_STARTED",
   "updateTime": "TIMESTAMP"
 },
 "source": "Domain wide takeout",
 "startTime": "TIMESTAMP",
 "type": "Customer takeout initiated"
}
```


## Sample queries

The query sample provided in this section is from the **Google Workspace Activity by Users with Compromised Credentials** panel of the **Google Workspace - Alert Center - Investigations** Dashboard.

```sql
_sourceCategory=googleworkspace_google_apps
| json "actor", "events", "id" nodrop
| json field=actor "email"
| json field=id "applicationName"
| where [subquery:_sourceCategory=googleworkspace_alerts "Leaked password"
 | json "alertId","customerId","source","type","data", "data.email" as alert_id, customer_id, source, type, data, email
 | where type="Leaked password"
 | count by email
 | compose email
]
| parse regex field=events "\"name\":\"(?<event_name>[^\"]+)\",\"type\":\"(?<event_type>[^\"]+)\"" multi
| formatDate(_messageTime,"MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss:SSS") as event_time
| count by event_time, event_name, event_type, email, applicationName
| fields -_count
| sort by event_time
```


## Collection overview

Sumo Logic provides a serverless solution which pulls logs from Google Workspace with API calls. You can configure the list alerts to be collected, but by default all alerts are collected. The alerts  are then forwarded to Sumo Logic’s HTTP endpoint in JSON format. By default the collection starts from the current date and time, but this setting is also configurable as detailed in the [Advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) section.

## Add a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source

This section demonstrates how to add a hosted Sumo Logic collector and HTTP Logs and Metrics source, to collect alerts for Google Workspace Alert Center.

1. Identify the Sumo Logic Hosted Collector you want to use, or create a new Hosted Collector as described in the following task.When you configure the HTTP Source, make sure to save the HTTP Source Address URL. You will need this to configure in configuration file.
1. Create a new Sumo Logic Hosted Collector by performing the steps in [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
1. Add an  HTTP Logs and Metrics Source.
1. In the Advanced Options for Logs, under Timestamp Format, click **Specify a format** and enter the following information in the respective fields:
   * **Format:** `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'`
   * **Timestamp locator:** `\"createTime\":(.*),`
1. Click **Test** and paste in a test log line when prompted to do so.
1. If the test is successful, click **Save**.
1. Make a note of the URL of the new source.


## Configure collection for Google Workspace Alert Center

In this section, we explore various mechanisms to collect findings from Google Workspace Alert Center and send them to Sumo Logic, where they are shown in dashboards as part of the Google Workspace App. You can configure your Google Workspace Alert Center collector in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or by deploying script-based collection on a Linux machine.

### Using GCP Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring Google Workspace Alert Center collection in your GCP environment. The Google Workspace Alert Center collector function fetches the findings from Google Workspace and sends them to Sumo Logic.

To configure Google Workspace Alert Center collection in your GCP environment, do the following:
1. Go to the [Cloud Shell Editor](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/).
2. Run the following command:
  ```bash
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-gsuitealertcenter/master/sumo_gsuite_alerts_collector_deploy.sh
  ```
3. Edit the `sumo_gsuite_alerts_collector_deploy.sh` bash script to configure following variables:
   * `region`: The Region where the Google function will be deployed. For example: "us-central1"
   * `project_id`: The project id of the project where the collector and all its resources will be deployed
   * `delegated_email`: The valid email address of one of your org's G Suite super admin users.
   * `Sumo_endpoint`: The Sumo Logic HTTP endpoint created in Step 1
4. Run the following script:
  ```bash
  sh sumo_gsuite_alerts_collector_deploy.sh
  ```
5. In the command prompt, enter `N` for the following question: `Allow unauthenticated invocations of new function`.
6. Copy the **Client ID** displayed at the end of the script output. You will use the Client Name field when you [configure Google Workspace Alert Center to allow client API access](#configure-google-workspace-alert-center-to-allow-client-api-acce) in the following task.
7. Go to the Cloud Datastore page of the project, with the Project ID you configured in the previous steps of this procedure, and create a database instance with the **Cloud Firestore in Datastore Mode** option. For more information, refer to the [Google Cloud Datastore documentation](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/quickstart).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/GSuite_AlertCenter_DatastoreMode.png')} alt="google workspace" />

:::note
The script you used in this procedure configured the environment variables in the config file. You can update the variables by following the instructions Google's [Updating environment variables documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var).

#### Configure Google Workspace Alert Center to allow client API access

This section explains how to configure Google Workspace Alert Center to allow API access.

Follow the step 2 and step 3 under “Set up the Alert Center API” [docs](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/guides/prerequisites) to enable alert center API and grant domain-wide access to the application.

To configure GCP Collection for Google Workspace Alert Center, use the **Client ID** for the service account copied in Step 6 [here](#google-cloud-platform-gcp-collection).

If you're using the [Configure Script-Based Collection for Google Workspace Alert Center](#configure-script-based-collection-for-google-workspace-alert-center) use the **Client ID** present in the JSON generated after adding the key in the service account.

To configure Google Workspace Alert Center:
1. Go to your G Suite domain's Admin console (see instructions on [signing in to your Admin console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182076)), go to **Security > Access and data control > API Controls**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/gw.png')} alt="google workspace" width="200"/>
1. In the newly opened window, click **Manage Domain-wide Delegation** at the bottom.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/GSuite_Step3.png')} alt="google workspace" />
1. Click **Add new** button on the top.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/GSuite_Step4.png')} alt="google workspace" />
1. Enter the **Client ID** for the service account copied in Step 2, then in the **OAuth Scopes** field enter the following: [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.alerts](https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.alerts). <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/GSuite_Step5.png')} alt="google workspace" width="400"/>
1. Click **Authorise**.


#### Adding new Alert types

In the future, if Google adds a new alert type do the following to add new alert types:

1. Go to the **gsuitealertcenterfunc** google cloud function console.
2. Click **Edit** at the top and then click **Next**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/Alert_Type_Step2.png')} alt="google workspace" />
3. In the editor, edit the **gsuitealertcenter.yaml** file and add the new alert types in `ALERT_TYPES` parameter from the “Alert type” column present in Google Workspace [Alert types documentation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/reference/alert-types). <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/Alert_Type_Step3.png')} alt="google workspace" />
4. Click **Deploy**.

1. Click **View** button under **Logs** column corresponding to the Cloud Scheduler job starting with sumogsuite as show below.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/Cloud_Scheduler_2.png')} alt="google workspace" />
1. In the newly opened window, you should be able to see logs with no errors seen under **Severity**. If there is an error, you can see more details by clicking on the **Error** section under **Severity**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/Cloud_Scheduler_3.png')} alt="google workspace" />


### Using Script-Based Collection

This section provides instructions for deploying script-based collection for Google Workspace Alert Center. This script collects logs for the Sumo Logic Google Workspace Alert Center App.

The _sumologic-_gsuite_alertcenter_ script is compatible with python 3.7 and python 2.7. This has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Debian 4.9.130.

#### Prerequisites

* This task assumes you have successfully added a **Hosted Collector** and **HTTP source**, as described in [Configure Collection for Google Workspace Alert Center](#Configure_Collection_for_Google_Workspace_Alert_Center).
* The following tasks assume you are logged in to the user account with which you will install the collector. If you are not, use the following command to switch to that account:
```bash
sudo su <user_name>
```

#### Configure the script on a Linux machine

This task shows you how to install the script on a Linux machine.

For python 3, use `pip3 install sumologic-gsuitealertcenter` (step 3) and `/usr/bin/python3 -m sumogsuitealertscollector.main` (step 6) in operating systems where default python is not python3.

To deploy the script, do the following:
1. Set up the Alert Center API as described in the following [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/alertcenter/guides/prerequisites). Assign the Cloud Datastore Owner role while creating a service account. Copy the Client ID present in the JSON generated after adding the key in the service account (it will be used further in step 3 while granting domain wide access). <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/clipboard_ef0b96eaf630b4eaafbb4ff59af9c507b.png')} alt="google workspace" />
While creating the key in the service account, make a note of the location of the Service Account JSON file that has been downloaded to your computer. You will need this path later.
2. If **pip** is not already installed, follow the instructions in the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to download and install **pip**.
3. Log in to a Linux machine (compatible with either Python 3.7 or Python 2.7) and install the script using the following command. For python 3, use **pip3 install** in the following command.
```bash
pip install sumologic-gsuitealertcenter
```
4. Create a configuration file named **gsuitealertcenter.yaml** in home directory by copying the following snippet.
```yaml
SumoLogic:
  SUMO_ENDPOINT: <SUMO LOGIC HTTP URL>

GsuiteAlertCenter:
  DELEGATED_EMAIL: "<email address of your org's Google Workspace super admin>"
  CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH: "<path to json Service Account JSON file>"

Collection:
  ENVIRONMENT: onprem
```
5. Add the **`SUMO_ENDPOINT`** and **`CREDENTIALS_FILEPATH`** (from step 1 above), and **`DELEGATED_EMAIL`** parameters, then save the file. For the **`DELEGATED_EMAIL`** parameter: if you do not have an email address of one of your super admins, you can use a service account email address instead if you [delegate domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) to that account.
6. Create a cron job for running the collector every 5 minutes by using `crontab -e` and adding the following line. If you're using python3, for operating systems where the default python is not python3, use `/usr/bin/python3 -m sumogsuitealertscollector.main` in the following command.
```bash
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python -m sumogsuitealertscollector.main > /dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Advanced Configuration

This section provides a list of environment variables for Google Workspace Alert Center that you can define in the configuration file, as shown in this example. See the following table for explanations for each of the environment variables.

For information on how to set these environment variables, refer to this [Google Cloud document](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var).

#### Troubleshooting

This section shows you how to run the function manually and then verify that log messages are being sent from Alert Center. To run the function manually, do the following:
1. Enter one of the following commands:
   * For **python**, use this command:
   ```bash
   python -m sumogsuitealertscollector.main
   ```
   * For **python3**, use this command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m sumogsuitealertscollector.main
   ```
1. The script generates logs in **/tmp/sumoapiclient.log** by default. Check these logs to verify whether it’s getting triggered or not.
1. If you installed the collector as `root` user and then run it as a normal user, you will see an error message similar to the following because the config is not present in the home directory of the user running the collector. Switch to `root` the user and run the script again.
```js
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/main.py", line 190, in main
   ns = GSuiteAlertsCollector()
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/main.py", line 29, in __init__
   self.config = Config().get_config(self.CONFIG_FILENAME, self.root_dir, cfgpath)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/common/config.py", line 22, in get_config
   self.validate_config(self.config)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/common/config.py", line 34, in validate_config
   raise Exception("Invalid config")
Exception: Invalid config
```
You can also avoid this error by running the script with config file path as first argument.
1. To verify if there are new messages generated by Alert Center, go to Google **Home > Security > Alert Center** and then do the following:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/google/GSuite_Alert_Center_Troubleshooting.png')} alt="google workspace" />
1. Check for an error message similar to the following. If you see this, verify that the **DELEGATED_EMAIL** in your configuration belongs to a valid Google Workspace super admin user (or a service account that's been [delegated domain-wide authority](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation)).
   ```js
   Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/main.py", line 191, in main
   ns.run()

   returned "Request contains an invalid argument.">
   ```
1. If you installed the collector as `root` user and then run it as a normal user, you will see an error message similar to the following because the config is not present in the home directory of user running the collector. Switch to `root` user and run the script again.
   ```js
   Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/main.py", line 190, in main
   ns = GSuiteAlertsCollector()
    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/main.py", line 29, in __init__
   self.config = Config().get_config(self.CONFIG_FILENAME, self.root_dir, cfgpath)
    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/common/config.py", line 22, in get_config
   self.validate_config(self.config)
    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumogsuitealertscollector/common/config.py", line 34, in validate_config
   raise Exception("Invalid config")
   Exception: Invalid config
   ```

You can also avoid this error by running the script with config file path as first argument.
