Dataproc Metastore is a fully managed, highly available, autohealing, serverless, and Apache Hive metastore (HMS) that runs on Google Cloud. For more details, refer to the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/overview)

## Log types

* [Platform Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
* [Audit Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/appflow-cloudtrail-logs.html)

## Setup

You can collect the logs for Sumo Logic's Google Cloud Dataproc Metastore integration by following the below steps.

### Configure logs collection

* Collect **Audit Logs** using the [Google Cloud Platform source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/google-cloud-platform-source). These Audit Logs can be accessed based on the [permissions and roles](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/audit-logging#audit_log_permissions). To enable logging for Google Dataproc Metastore, refer to [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/audit-logging#enabling_audit_logging). For more detail on Dataproc Metastore operations being audited, refer to [audited operations](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/audit-logging#audited_operations). While creating the sync in GCP, as part of the **Choose logs to include in sink** section, you can use the following query:
   ```sql
   (resource.type=audited_resource AND resource.labels.service=metastore.googleapis.com)
   ```
* Collect **Platform Logs** using the [Google Cloud Platform source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/google-cloud-platform-source). Platform logs include service logs and [Metadata federation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc-metastore/docs/hms-federation). While creating the sync in GCP, as part of the **Choose logs to include in sink** section, you can use the following query:
   ```sql
   resource.type=metastore.googleapis.com/Service OR metastore.googleapis.com/Federation
   ```
