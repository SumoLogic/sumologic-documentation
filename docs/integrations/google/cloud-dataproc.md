Dataproc is a managed Spark and Hadoop service that lets you take advantage of open source data tools for batch processing, querying, streaming, and machine learning. For more details, refer to the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/how-to)

## Log and metric types

* [Google Cloud Metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp)
* [Platform Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
* [Audit Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/appflow-cloudtrail-logs.html)

## Setup

You can collect the logs and metrics for Sumo Logic's Google Cloud Dataproc integration by following the below steps.

### Configure logs collection

* Collect **Audit Logs** using the [Google Cloud Platform source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/google-cloud-platform-source). These Audit Logs can be accessed based on the [permissions and roles](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/audit-logging#audit_log_permissions). To enable logging for Google Dataproc, refer to [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/audit-logging#enabling_audit_logging). For more detail on Dataproc operations being audited, refer to [audited operations](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/audit-logging#audited_operations). While creating the sync in GCP, as part of the **Choose logs to include in sink** section, you can use the following query:
   ```sql
   (resource.type=audited_resource resource.labels.service=dataproc.googleapis.com)
   ```

* Collect **Platform Logs** using the [Google Cloud Platform source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/google-cloud-platform-source). Dataproc platform logs include job logs and cluster logs. [Here](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/logging#permissions) are the permissions required to access job and cluster logs. While creating the sync in GCP, as part of the **Choose logs to include in sink** section, you can use the following query:
   ```sql
   (resource.type=(cloud_dataproc_cluster OR cloud_dataproc_job))
   ```

### Configure metrics collection

* Collect **GCP Metrics** using the [GCP Metric](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/gcp-metrics-source/) source. Under the **Services** dropdown, select **Cloud Dataproc**. For Google Dataproc metrics and dimensions, refer to [Google Dataproc metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-dataproc).
