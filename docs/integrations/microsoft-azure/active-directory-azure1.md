Azure Active Directory is a cloud-based directory and identity management service that provides directory services, application access management, and identity protection.

The Sumo Logic App for Azure helps you monitor activity in the Azure Active Directory. The dashboards provide insight into role management, user management, group management, successful and failed sign-in events, directory management, and application management data that helps you understand your users' experience.

* Azure Monitor collects logs for Azure Active Directory and streams the data to an Azure Event Hub.
* Event Hub streams the logs collected by Azure Monitor to an Azure function.
* The Azure function is a small piece of code that is triggered by Event Hub to send Azure Active Directory logs to the Sumo HTTP Source. The function also logs to one Storage Account and logs failover data to another.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription must be associated (attached) to AAD. For more information, see this [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).
* To export Azure Activity logs to reports, be sure you have met the [Azure Active Directory requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-activity-logs-azure-monitor).

## Log Types

The app uses the following log types:
* Audit and Sign-in logs

Only global administrators, security administrators, security readers, and report readers can view sign-ins and enable collection for Sign-in Events.

## Collecting Logs for Azure Active Directory

This section has instructions for setting up the ingestion pipeline from Azure Active Directory to Sumo Logic.

The sections below are either for FedRamp Sumo Logic deployments or if you have been advised by the Sumo Logic support team to not use the Cloud to Cloud Integration based on your Azure environments.

### Configure an HTTP Source

In this step, you configure an HTTP Source to receive logs from the Azure function.
1. Select a Hosted Collector where you want to configure the HTTP Source. If desired, create a new Hosted Collector, as described on [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an HTTP source, as described on [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).

### Configure Azure Resources using ARM template

In this step, you use a Sumo-provided Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create an Event Hub, an Azure function and two Storage Accounts. The Azure function is triggered by Event Hub. Two storage accounts are used to store log messages from the Azure function and failover data from Event Hub.

1. Download the [azuredeploy_logs.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/appdev-cloudformation-templates/azuredeploy_logs.json) ARM template.
2. Go to **Template deployment** in the Azure Portal.
3. Click **Create**.
4. On the **Custom deployment** blade, click **Build your own template in the editor**.
5. Copy the contents of `azuredeploy_logs.json`, and paste it into the editor window.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Now you are back on the **Custom deployment** blade.
    1. Create a new Resource Group (recommended) or select an existing one.
    2. Choose Location.
    3. In the **Sumo Endpoint URL** field, enter the URL of the HTTP Source you configured in [Step 1](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-logs-azure-monitor#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
    4. Agree to the terms and conditions.
    5. Click **Purchase**.
8. Verify the deployment was successful by looking at **Notifications** at the top right corner of Azure Portal.
9. **(Optional)** In the same window, you can click **Go to resource group** to verify all resources have been created successfully. You will see something like this:
10. Go to **Storage accounts** and search for “sumofailmsg”. Click on `sumofailmsg_<random-string>`.
11. Under **Blob Service**, click **Containers**, then click **+ Container**, enter the Name **azureaudit-failover**, and select **Private** for the **Public Access Level**. Click **OK**.

### Troubleshooting the log collection

If logs are not flowing into Sumo Logic, see [Troubleshooting Log Collection](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-logs-azure-monitor#troubleshooting-log-collection).

## Installing the Azure Active Directory App

Now that you have set up collection for the Azure Active Directory, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
