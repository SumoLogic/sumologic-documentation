[Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. This integration helps in monitoring the health, tracking executions, and estimating the cost of your function apps.

## Log and metric types

The Sumo Logic app for Azure Functions app uses the following log and metrics types:

* **Function Application Logs**. Log generated by the Function App. It includes the logs emitted by the Functions host and logs emitted by customer code. Use these logs to monitor application health, performance, and behavior. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/functionapplogs).
* **App Service Authentication Logs**. App Service Authentication Logs are generated for common *Warning* and *Error* logs from the App Service authentication requests. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/appserviceauthenticationlogs).

To learn more about configuring monitoring for Azure functions, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/configure-monitoring).

* **Activity logs**. Provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in Azure. To learn more, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

* **Azure Functions specific metrics**. These are metrics specific to Functions like execution count and execution units. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/monitor-functions-reference#azure-functions-specific-metrics).
* **General App Service metrics**. Metrics which App Service platform implements. These metrics are available in the `Microsoft.Web/sites` namespace. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-monitor#understand-metrics).

### Sample queries

```sql title="Error by function app"
tenant_name=* subscription_id=* location=* resource_group=* provider_name=microsoft.web resource_type=sites  resource_name=* (metric=Http4xx or metric=Http5xx) statistic=total
```

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Functions you want to monitor. Diagnostic Settings are not supported for function apps running on version 1.x. You can forward logs to the same Event Hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/FunctionApp/Logs`, `Azure/FunctionApp/Metrics`.

### Configure metrics collection

To set up the Azure Metrics source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

:::note
Sumo Logic Metrics source is currently in Beta, to participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive.

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
2. To create the **Diagnostic setting** in the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the steps below for each Azure Functions that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `AllMetrics`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Functions-Configure-Diagnostic-Metrics.png')} alt="Azure Functions app Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
3. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Functions app Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity logs (optional)

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). If you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription, do not perform this step.

:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions, make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.

##### Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud

For Security events, make sure you enable [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-enable-app-service-plan#enable-the-defender-for-app-service-plan). In Defender Plans Settings page toggle the App Service status under Cloud Workload Protection section.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Microsoft-Cloud-Defender-Plans-AppService.png')} alt="Cloud Defender Plans" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

##### Enabling health check metric

For getting the health check metric, make sure you enable **Health check** under the **Monitoring** dropdown.

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
- `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances the service is Subscriptions).
