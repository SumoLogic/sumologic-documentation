[Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. This integration helps in monitoring the health, tracking executions, and estimating cost of your function apps.

## Log and metric types

The Sumo Logic app for Azure Functions app uses the following log and metrics types:

* **Function Application Logs**. Log generated by the Function App. It includes the logs emitted by the Functions host and logs emitted by customer code. Use these logs to monitor application health, performance, and behavior. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/functionapplogs).
* **App Service Authentication Logs**. App Service Authentication Logs are generated for common *Warning* and *Error* logs from the App Service authentication requests. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/appserviceauthenticationlogs).

To learn more about configuring monitoring for azure functions, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/configure-monitoring).

* **Activity logs**, provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in the Azure. To learn more, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

* **Azure Functions specific metrics**. These are metrics specific to Functions like execution count and execution units.
For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/monitor-functions-reference#azure-functions-specific-metrics).
* **General App Service metrics**. Metrics which App Service platform implements. These metrics are available in the `Microsoft.Web/sites` namespace. For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-monitor#understand-metrics).

### Sample queries

```sql title="Error by function app"
tenant_name=* subscription_id=* location=* resource_group=* provider_name=microsoft.web resource_type=sites  resource_name=* (metric=Http4xx or metric=Http5xx) statistic=total
```

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Functions you want to monitor. Diagnostic Settings are not supported for function apps running on version 1.x. You can forward logs to the same Event Hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/FunctionApp/Logs`, `Azure/FunctionApp/Metrics`.

### Configure field in field schema
1. <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). Kanso--> In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new/). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**. Kanso-->
1. Search for following fields:
   - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level and you can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
   - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
   - `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where resource is present.
   - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
   - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.WEB).
   - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, SITES).
   - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, Azure Function App name).
1. Create the fields if they are not present. Refer to [Manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure Field Extraction Rules

Create a Field Extraction Rule (FER) by following the instructions [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/). If the FER already exists with same name, then skip this step.

#### Azure Location Extraction FER

```sql
Rule Name: AzureLocationExtractionFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
```

```sql title="Parse Expression"
json "location", "properties.resourceLocation", "properties.region" as location, resourceLocation, service_region nodrop
| replace(toLowerCase(resourceLocation), " ", "") as resourceLocation
| if (!isBlank(resourceLocation), resourceLocation, location) as location
| if (!isBlank(service_region), service_region, location) as location
| if (isBlank(location), "global", location) as location
| fields location
```

#### Resource ID Extraction FER

```sql
Rule Name: AzureResourceIdExtractionFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
```

```sql title="Parse Expression"
json "resourceId"
| toUpperCase(resourceId) as resourceId
| parse regex field=resourceId "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/(?<subscription_id>[^/]+)" nodrop
| parse field=resourceId "/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/" as resource_group nodrop
| parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/(?<provider_name>[^/]+)" nodrop
| parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/[^/]+(?:/LOCATIONS/[^/]+)?/(?<resource_type>[^/]+)/(?<resource_name>.+)" nodrop
| parse regex field=resource_name "(?<parent_resource_name>[^/]+)(?:/PROVIDERS/[^/]+)?/(?<service_type>[^/]+)/?(?<service_name>.+)" nodrop
| if (isBlank(parent_resource_name), resource_name, parent_resource_name) as resource_name
| fields subscription_id, location, provider_name, resource_group, resource_type, resource_name, service_type,service_name
```


### Configure metric rules

#### Azure Observability Metadata Extraction Service Level

If this rule already exists, there's no need to create it again.

```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionFunctionAppLevel
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/*/SITES/* tenant_name=*
```

| Fields extracted | Metric rule    |
|:-----------------|:---------------|
| `subscription_id`  | $resourceId._1 |
| `resource_group`   | $resourceId._2 |
| `provider_name`    | $resourceId._3 |
| `resource_type`    | SITES |
| `resource_name`    | $resourceId._4 |


### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic.

1. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
1. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
1. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each Azure Functions that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   1. Select `AllMetrics`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event Hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the **Diagnostic setting** in the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the below steps for each Azure Functions that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `AllMetrics`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in previous step in destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Functions-Configure-Diagnostic-Metrics.png')} alt="Azure Storage Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
