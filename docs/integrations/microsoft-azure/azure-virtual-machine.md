[Azure Virtual Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) is a virtualized computing environment on Microsoft's cloud platform, that allows users to run applications and tasks on a dedicated, scalable, and on-demand basis. Azure Virtual Machine (VM) provides scalable computing capacity in the Azure Cloud. You can use Azure VM to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

The Sumo Logic app for Azure VM allows you to collect your VM instance metrics and display them using predefined dashboards. The app provides dashboards to display analysis of VM instance metrics for CPU, disk, network, cache, and memory. Also, it provides detailed insights into all audit events associated with VM instances and specifically helps identify changes, errors, and user activities.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Virtual Machine, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Activity logs**. To learn more about the different Activity log category types and schemas collected for Azure Virtual Machine, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#activity-log).
* **Virtual Machine Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines, Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachineScaleSets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#metrics) namespace. For more information on supported metrics and their units, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftcomputevirtualmachines).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Virtual Machine you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/VM/ActivityLogs`, `Azure/VM/Metrics`.

###  Configure collector

Create a hosted collector if not already configured and tag the `tenant_name` field. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name). Make sure you create the required sources in this collector. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Configure metrics collection

import MetricsSource from '../../reuse/metrics-source.md';

<MetricsSource/>

:::note
Metric Rule `AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionVMName` will be created automatically as a part of app installation process.
This metric rule creates new dimension `vmname` for non scale set VMs.
:::

### Configure logs collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

#### Diagnostic logs

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the  [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the Diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#create-diagnostic-settings). Perform the steps below for each Azure Virtual Machine namespace that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azure-eventgrid-logs.png')} alt="Azure Event Grid logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Virtual Machine Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity logs (optional)

import ActivityLogs from '../../reuse/apps/azure-activity-logs.md';

<ActivityLogs/>

## Installing the Azure Virtual Machine app

import AppInstallIndexV2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-index-option.md';

<AppInstallIndexV2/>

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
- `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances the service is Subscriptions).

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP Logs and Metrics Source used by Azure Functions

To troubleshoot metrics collection, follow the instructions in [Troubleshooting Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source/#troubleshooting).

### App installation failed - Content install error - Rule with name AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionVMName already exists.

This error occurs if the app being installed attempts to create a Metric Rule by a name (AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionVMName) which already exists in the org. This Metric Rule could have been created manually and is creating conflict with current app installation flow.

To resolve the issue, delete the existing Metric Rule (AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionVMName) and reinstall the app.
