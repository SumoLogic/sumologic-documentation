[Azure Virtual Machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/) is a virtualized computing environment on Microsoft's cloud platform, that allows users to run applications and tasks on a dedicated, scalable, and on-demand basis. Azure Virtual Machine (VM) provides scalable computing capacity in the Azure Cloud. You can use Azure VM to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

The Sumo Logic app for Azure VM allows you to collect your VM instance metrics and display them using predefined dashboards. The app provides dashboards to display analysis of VM instance metrics for CPU, disk, network, cache, and memory. Also, it provides detailed insights into all audit events associated with VM instances and specifically helps identify changes, errors, and user activities.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Virtual Machine, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Activity logs**. To learn more about the different Activity log category types and schemas collected for Azure Virtual Machine, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#activity-log).
* **Virtual Machine Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines, Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachineScaleSets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#metrics) namespace. For more information on supported metrics and their units, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/monitor-vm-reference#supported-metrics-for-microsoftcomputevirtualmachines).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Virtual Machine you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/VM/ActivityLogs`, `Azure/VM/Metrics`.

### Configure field in field schema

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**.
1. Search for the following fields:
    - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
    - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
    - `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
    - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
    - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
    - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
    - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
    - `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
    - `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances service is Subscriptions).
1. Create the fields if they are not present. Refer to [Manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure metric rules

* **Azure Observability Metadata Extraction VMName**

  In case this rule already exists, then no need to create it again.

```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionVMName
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
tenant_name=* namespace=Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines resource_name=*
```

| Fields extracted | Metric rule    |
|:--|:--|
| `vmname`  | `$resource_name._1` |

### Configure metrics collection

:::note
The Sumo Logic metrics source for Azure is currently in Beta. To participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive.
:::

1. To set up the Azure Metrics source in Sumo Logic, refer to the shared beta documentation.
1. In the Sumo Logic Azure Metrics source configuration, configure namespaces as `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines` and `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets`.

### Configure logs collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

#### Diagnostic logs

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the  [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the Diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#create-diagnostic-settings). Perform the steps below for each Azure Virtual Machine namespace that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azure-eventgrid-logs.png')} alt="Azure Event Grid logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Virtual Machine Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity Logs

To collect activity logs, refer to the [Collecting Logs for the Azure Audit App from Event Hub](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit) section in the Azure Audit documentation. Do not perform this step in case you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.

:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions, make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.
