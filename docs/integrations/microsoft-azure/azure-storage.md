[Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction) is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios offering highly available, massively scalable, durable, and secure storage for a variety of data objects in the cloud. This integration helps in monitoring the transaction volume and read/write activity of all your storage accounts.

In Azure Storage, [storage accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) allow you to create and manage the following storage services:

* **[Blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview)** stores any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. You can set Blob storage for private access or share contents publicly to the Internet. Blob storage serves the same purpose as both AWS S3 and EBS.
* **[Table storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/table-storage-overview)**. Stores structured datasets. Table storage is a NoSQL key-attribute data store that allows for rapid development and fast access to large quantities of data. Similar to AWS SimpleDB and DynamoDB services.
* **[Queue storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction)**. Provides messaging for workflow processing and for communication between components of cloud services.
* **[File storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction)**. Offers shared storage for legacy applications using the standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. File storage is used in a similar manner to EFS in the AWS platform.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Storage, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

**Resource logs**, which provide an insight into operations that were performed within an Azure resource. For a complete schema for resource logs refer to the below documentation:
* [Azure Blob Storage schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage-reference#resource-logs)
* [Azure File Storage schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-monitoring-reference#resource-logs)
* [Azure Queue Storage schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/monitor-queue-storage-reference#resource-logs)
* [Azure File Storage schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/monitor-table-storage-reference#resource-logs)

Requests made by the Blob storage service itself, such as log creation or deletion, aren't logged. For a full list of the logged data, see [Storage logged operations and status messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics-logged-operations-and-status-messages).

**Metrics** for Azure Storage are in below namespaces:
* [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-metrics)
* [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-blobservices-metrics)
* [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/fileServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-fileservices-metrics)
  * [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/queueServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-queueservices-metrics)
  * [Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/tableServices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-storage-storageaccounts-tableservices-metrics)

:::note
Only metrics with `category=Transaction` can be exported from diagnostic settings export feature.
:::

Click on the above namespaces to learn more about the supported metrics. For a complete list of the dimensions that Azure Storage supports, refer to the below documentation.

* [Azure Blob Storage Metrics dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/monitor-blob-storage-reference#metrics-dimensions)
* [Azure File Storage Metrics dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-monitoring-reference#metrics)
* [Azure Queue Storage Metrics dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/queues/monitor-queue-storage-reference#metrics)
* [Azure Table Storage Metrics dimensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/tables/monitor-table-storage-reference#metrics)

:::info
Capacity metrics are currently not supported via Diagnostic Settings.
:::

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Activity Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/). It is recommended to create a separate source for activity logs. If you are already collecting these logs, you can skip this step.
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each storage service (blob,queue,table and file) and each storage account that you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/Storage/Logs`, `Azure/Storage/Metrics`.

### Configure field in field schema
1. <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). Kanso--> In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new/). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**. Kanso-->
2. Search for following fields:
   - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level and users can get the tenant name using the instructions here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name
   - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
   - `subscription_id`. Id associated with a subscription where resource is present.
   - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
   - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for  ex Microsoft.Storage).
   - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for ex storageaccounts).
   - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for ex storage account name).
   - `service_type`. Services that can be accessed from within a azure resource (Ex table service in storage account).

3. Create the fields if it is not present. Refer to [create and manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure Field Extraction Rules

Create a Field Extraction Rule (FER) for Azure Storage by following the instructions [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/).

* **Activity Logs Location Extraction FER**

   ```sql
   Rule Name: AzureLocationExtractionFER
   Applied at: Ingest Time
   Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
   ```

   ```sql title="Parse Expression"
   json "location", "properties.resourceLocation", "properties.region" as location, resourceLocation, service_region nodrop
   | replace(toLowerCase(resourceLocation), " ", "") as resourceLocation
   | if (!isBlank(resourceLocation), resourceLocation, location) as location
   | if (!isBlank(service_region), service_region, location) as location 
   | if (isBlank(location), "global", location) as location
   | fields location
   ```

* **Resource ID Extraction FER**

   ```sql
   Rule Name: AzureResourceIdExtractionFER
   Applied at: Ingest Time
   Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
   ```

   ```sql title="Parse Expression"
   json "resourceId"
   | toUpperCase(resourceId) as resourceId
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/(?<subscription_id>[^/]+)" nodrop
   | parse field=resourceId "/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/" as resource_group nodrop
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/(?<provider_name>[^/]+)" nodrop
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/[^/]+(?:/LOCATIONS/[^/]+)?/(?<resource_type>[^/]+)/(?<resource_name>.+)" nodrop
   | parse regex field=resource_name "(?<parent_resource_name>[^/]+)(?:/PROVIDERS/[^/]+)?/(?<service_type>[^/]+)/?(?<child_service_name>.+)" nodrop
   | if (isBlank(parent_resource_name), resource_name, parent_resource_name) as resource_name
   | fields subscription_id, location, provider_name, resource_group, resource_type, resource_name, service_type
   ```
### Configure metric rules

  * **Azure Observability Metadata Extraction Metric Rule Service Level**

      In case this rule is already exists then no need to create again.
```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionServiceLevel    
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/*/*/*/*/* tenant_name=*
```
| Fields extracted | Metric rule    |
|------------------|----------------|
| subscription_id  | $resourceId._1 |
| resource_group   | $resourceId._2 |
| provider_name    | $resourceId._3 |
| resource_type    | $resourceId._4 |
| resource_name    | $resourceId._5 |
| service_type     | $resourceId._6 |

* **Azure Observability Metadata Extraction Storage Account Level**
```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionStorageAccountLevel
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
resourceId=*/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/*/*/* tenant_name=* accountresourceid=*
```
| Fields extracted | Metric rule    |
|------------------|----------------|
| subscription_id  | $resourceId._1 |
| resource_group   | $resourceId._2 |
| provider_name    | $resourceId._3 |
| resource_type    | $resourceId._4 |
| resource_name    | $resourceId._5 |

### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic.

1. Create hosted collector and tag tenant_name field
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Storage Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
2. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
2. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each storage service (blob,queue,table and file) and each storage account that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   * Select `Transaction`.
   * Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
2. To create the Diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform below steps for each storage service (blob,queue,table and file) and each storage account that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   * Select `allLogs`.
   * Use the Event hub namespace and Event hub name configured in previous step in destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.
3. Tag the location field in the source with right location value.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Storage Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
   
#### Activity Logs

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). Do not perform this step in case you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.

:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.
