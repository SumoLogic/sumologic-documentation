The Active Directory Legacy App allows you to analyze Windows Active Directory logs and gain insight into your deployment. Using the app, you can identify user activity across your network and security administration systems. The app uses predefined searches and Dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

We recommend using the Active Directory App in combination with the Windows App.

## Collecting Logs


## Installing the Sumo Logic App

Now that you have set up collection for Active Directory, install the Sumo Logic App for Active Directory Legacy to use the pre-configured searches and [dashboards](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/04Microsoft-and-Azure/Active_Directory_Legacy/Active-Directory-Legacy-App-Dashboards#Dashboards) that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

**To install the app:**

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library** and complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.â€¨
    2. **Data Source.** Select **Enter a Custom Data Filter** and enter a filter that references the Windows Event Logs source and the script sources" (configured as described in [Collect Active Directory Log Files](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/04Microsoft-and-Azure/Active_Directory_Legacy/Collect_Log_Files_for_the_Active_Directory_Legacy_App)).

See [Welcome to the New Library](https://help.sumologic.com/01Start-Here/Welcome-to-the-New-Library) for information on working with the library in the new UI.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

Sumo Logic recommends using the Sumo Logic App for Active Directory in combination with the [Sumo Logic App for Windows](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/04Microsoft-and-Azure/Windows_Legacy).


## Viewing Active Directory Legacy Dashboards

The Sumo Logic application for Windows Active Directory (AD) includes several Dashboards that allow you instant access to information about your system's visitors, traffic, and web server operations.


### Information Dashboard

This Dashboard will not display data unless you have downloaded and deployed the scripts, as described in [Collecting Active Directory log files](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/04Microsoft-and-Azure/Active_Directory_Legacy/Collect_Log_Files_for_the_Active_Directory_Legacy_App).
