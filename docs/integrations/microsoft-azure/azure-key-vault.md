[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/) is a cloud service that helps you securely store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates. You can use it to protect data for cloud apps and services. This integration helps in comprehensive monitoring of your Key Vault operations, requests, failures, and latency.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Key Vault, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Resource logs**. To learn more about the different resource log category types and schemas collected for Azure Key Vault, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/monitor-key-vault-reference#resource-logs).
* **Key Vault Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-keyvault-vaults-metrics) namespace.
* **Managed HSM Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.KeyVault/managedhsms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-keyvault-managedhsms-metrics) namespace.

For more information on supported metrics and their units, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/key-vault/general/monitor-key-vault-reference#key-vault-metrics).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Key Vault you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/KeyVault/Logs`, `Azure/KeyVault/Metrics`.

### Configure metrics collection

:::note
Sumo Logic Metrics source is currently in Beta, to participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive.
:::

1. To set up the Azure Metrics source in Sumo Logic, refer to the shared beta documentation.
1. In the Sumo Logic Azure Metrics source configuration, configure namespaces as `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults` and `Microsoft.KeyVault/managedhsms`.

### Configure logs collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.
#### Diagnostic logs
1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the Diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#create-diagnostic-settings). Perform the steps below for each Azure Key Vault namespace that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azure-eventgrid-logs.png')} alt="Azure Event Grid logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Key Vaults Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity Logs

To collect activity logs, refer to the [Collecting Logs for the Azure Audit App from Event Hub](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit) section in the Azure Audit documentation. Do not perform this step in case you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.
:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions, make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.

## Installing the Azure Key Vault app

Now that you have set up data collection, install the Azure Key Vault Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured [dashboards](#viewing-the-azure-key-vault-dashboards) that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.
