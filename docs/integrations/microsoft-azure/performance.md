The Windows Performance App provides insight into your system's operation and events so that you can better manage and maintain your Windows systems. The App uses predefined Dashboards and searches that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of system and network performance and overall usage.

## Log Types

The Windows Performance App assumes events are coming from Windows Performance Sources.

**Also, you need to configure an additional custom query for each Source.** For details, see [Collect Logs for Windows Performance App](#Collect-Logs-for-the-Windows-Performance-App).

### Sample Queries

**Hosts with low available memory**


```

| parse regex "winbox = (?<dest_host>\S+)" nodrop
| if (isNull(dest_host) or dest_host="",_sourceHost,dest_host) as host

| timeslice 1m
| avg(aBytes) as AvgAvailableBytes by host,_timeslice
| int(AvgAvailableBytes/(1024*1024)) as AvgAvailMBytes
| where AvgAvailMBytes < 100 // 100MB is the threshold for this alert
| count as DataPoints by host
| where DataPoints >10 // another threshold: more than 10 minutes where the limit drops under the above threshold
```


**Avg CPU Usage (%) by Host**

```

## Collecting Logs for the Windows Performance App

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the Windows Performance App, as well as example log files and queries.

### Configure a Collector and Source

To collect logs for the Windows Performance App, you will need to configure an Installed Collector, and either a Local or Remote Windows Performance  Monitor Log Source.

To collect logs for the Windows Performance App, do the following:
1. Install a collector as described in [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors).
2. Configure a Windows Performance Source, choosing the one appropriate for on your environment:
    * [Local Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-performance-monitor-log-source).
    * [Remote Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-performance-monitor-log-source).


### Add a Custom Query to the Windows Performance Source

To complete the configuration, you'll need to edit each Windows Performance Source (you are using to collect logs) to add a custom query.

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**.
2. Find the Collector and the Windows Performance Source.
3. For the **Source**, click **Edit**.
4. Under **Perfmon Queries** select the check boxes for these queries:
    * CPU
    * Physical Disk
    * Memory
    * Network
5. Click **Add Query**.
    * For **Name**, enter **CPU per Process**.
    * For **Query**, enter **select * from Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfProc_Process**.
6. Click **Save**.



## Installing the Windows Performance App

Now that you have set up collection, install the Windows Performance App to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Windows Performance Dashboards

The Windows Performance App allows you to analyze Windows Performance logs and gain real time and historic insights of your environment, including CPU, disk, generic IO, memory, and network performance.
