[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It works on application layer (OSI layer 7) and supports URL based routing. This integration helps in analyzing access patterns, tracking performance information for each instance, including total requests served, throughput in bytes, healthy and unhealthy backend instance count.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Application Gateway, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Access log**. These logs provide information on access patterns including the caller's IP, requested URL, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out.
* **Performance log**. These log captures performance information for each instance, including total requests served, throughput in bytes, total requests served, failed request count, and healthy and unhealthy backend instance count. The Performance log is available only for the v1 SKU. For the v2 SKU, use Metrics for performance data.
* **Firewall log**. You can use this log to view the requests that are logged through either detection or prevention mode of an application gateway that is configured with the web application firewall.

To learn more about the different resource log category types and schemas collected for Azure Application Gateway, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#diagnostic-logging).

* **Activity logs**, provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in the Azure. To learnmore, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

* **Platform Metrics for Azure Application Gateway**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways) namespace.
For more information on supported metrics in Azure Application Gateway v1 and Azure Application Gateway v2, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-metrics).

## Setup

:::note
This app supports only Application Gateway V2 since Application Gateway V1 will soon be deprecated.
:::

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Application Gateway you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/ApplicationGateway/Logs`, `Azure/ApplicationGateway/Metrics`.


### Configure field in field schema

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**. 
1. Search for the following fields:
   - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
   - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
   - `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
   - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
   - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
   - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
   - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
   - `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
   - `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, Azure SQL databases in Azure SQL Server).
1. Create the fields if they are not present. Refer to [Manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure Field Extraction Rules

Create the following field extraction rules (FER) for Azure Storage by following the instructions in [Create a Field Extraction Rule](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/).

#### Azure location extraction FER

   ```sql
   Rule Name: AzureLocationExtractionFER
   Applied at: Ingest Time
   Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
   ```

   ```sql title="Parse Expression"
   json "location", "properties.resourceLocation", "properties.region" as location, resourceLocation, service_region nodrop
   | replace(toLowerCase(resourceLocation), " ", "") as resourceLocation
   | if (!isBlank(resourceLocation), resourceLocation, location) as location
   | if (!isBlank(service_region), service_region, location) as location 
   | if (isBlank(location), "global", location) as location
   | fields location
   ```

#### Resource ID extraction FER

   ```sql
   Rule Name: AzureResourceIdExtractionFER
   Applied at: Ingest Time
   Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
   ```

   ```sql title="Parse Expression"
   json "resourceId"
   | toUpperCase(resourceId) as resourceId
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/(?<subscription_id>[^/]+)" nodrop
   | parse field=resourceId "/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/" as resource_group nodrop
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/(?<provider_name>[^/]+)" nodrop
   | parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/[^/]+(?:/LOCATIONS/[^/]+)?/(?<resource_type>[^/]+)/(?<resource_name>.+)" nodrop
   | parse regex field=resource_name "(?<parent_resource_name>[^/]+)(?:/PROVIDERS/[^/]+)?/(?<service_type>[^/]+)/?(?<service_name>.+)" nodrop
   | if (isBlank(parent_resource_name), resource_name, parent_resource_name) as resource_name
   | fields subscription_id, location, provider_name, resource_group, resource_type, resource_name, service_type, service_name
   ```

### Configure metric rules

Create the following metrics rules by following the instructions in [Create a metrics rule](/docs/metrics/metric-rules-editor/#create-a-metrics-rule).

#### Azure observability metadata extraction application gateway level

```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionAppGatewayLevel
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/*/APPLICATIONGATEWAYS/* tenant_name=*
```
| Fields extracted  | Metric rule          |
|:------------------|:---------------------|
| subscription_id   | $resourceId._1       |
| resource_group    | $resourceId._2       |
| provider_name     | $resourceId._3       |
| resource_type     | APPLICATIONGATEWAYS  |
| resource_name     | $resourceId._4       |

### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic.

1. Create hosted collector and tag tenant_name field. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
2. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
3. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each Azure Application Gateway that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   1. Select `AllMetrics`.
   1. Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azureapplicationgateway-metrics.png')} alt="Azure application gateway metrics" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the steps below for each Azure application gateway account that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose **Stream to an event hub** as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.
1. Tag the location field in the source with right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Application Gateway Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" /> <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azureapplicationgateway-logs.png')} alt="Azure Application Gateway logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" /> 

:::note
WAF logs and metrics will be available for WAF V2 tier and only after a WAF Policy has been associated with application gateway. Refer to the azure docs for more information.
Go to **Settings -> Configuration** to check your application gateway tier
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/appgatway-tier-setting.png')} alt="Application Gateway Tier Settings" width="750"/>
:::

#### Activity Logs

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). Do not perform this step in case you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.

:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions, make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.
