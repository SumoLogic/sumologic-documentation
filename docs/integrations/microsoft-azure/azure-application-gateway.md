[Azure Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview) is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It works on application layer (OSI layer 7) and supports URL based routing. This integration helps in analyzing access patterns, tracking performance information for each instance, including total requests served, throughput in bytes, healthy and unhealthy backend instance count.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Application Gateway, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Access log**. These logs provide information on access patterns including the caller's IP, requested URL, response latency, return code, and bytes in and out.
* **Performance log**. These log captures performance information for each instance, including total requests served, throughput in bytes, total requests served, failed request count, and healthy and unhealthy backend instance count. The Performance log is available only for the v1 SKU. For the v2 SKU, use Metrics for performance data.
* **Firewall log**. You can use this log to view the requests that are logged through either detection or prevention mode of an application gateway that is configured with the web application firewall.

To learn more about the different resource log category types and schemas collected for Azure Application Gateway, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics#diagnostic-logging).

* **Activity logs**, provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in the Azure. To learnmore, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

* **Platform Metrics for Azure Application Gateway**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported#microsoftnetworkapplicationgateways) namespace.
For more information on supported metrics in Azure Application Gateway v1 and Azure Application Gateway v2, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-metrics).

## Setup

:::note
This app supports only Application Gateway V2 since Application Gateway V1 will soon be deprecated.
:::

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Application Gateway you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/ApplicationGateway/Logs`, `Azure/ApplicationGateway/Metrics`.

### Configure metrics collection

To set up the Azure Metrics source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the steps below for each Azure application gateway account that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose **Stream to an event hub** as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azureapplicationgateway-logs.png')} alt="Azure Application Gateway logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Tag the location field in the source with right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Application Gateway Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" /> 

:::note
WAF logs and metrics will be available for WAF V2 tier and only after a WAF Policy has been associated with application gateway. Refer to the azure docs for more information.
Go to **Settings -> Configuration** to check your application gateway tier
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/appgatway-tier-setting.png')} alt="Application Gateway Tier Settings" width="750"/>
:::

#### Activity Logs

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). Do not perform this step in case you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.

:::note
Since this source contains logs from multiple regions, make sure that you do not tag this source with the location tag.
:::

## Installing the Azure Application Gateway app

Now that you have set up data collection, install the Azure Application Gateway Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstallNoDataSourceV2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-index-apps-v2.md';

<AppInstallNoDataSourceV2/>

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
- `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances the service is Subscriptions).
