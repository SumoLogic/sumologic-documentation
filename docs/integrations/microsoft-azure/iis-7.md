The IIS 7 App monitors the performance and reliability of your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) infrastructure, identifying customer-facing and internal operational issues. Additionally, you can monitor customer paths and interactions to learn how customers are using your product. The app consists of predefined searches and Dashboards, which provide visibility into your environment for real time or historical analysis.


## Log types

IIS 7 Logs (IIS 7.5 logs are used) are generated as local files and written to this directory by default: `C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1`. The App assumes the following format:
```
# Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port
cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus
sc-win32-status time-taken
```

For details on setting fields to log, see http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754702(v=ws.10).aspx.

Sumo Logic expects W3C format with these fields for our Field Extraction Rules and IIS 7 Application: ([https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525807(v=vs.90).aspx](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms525807(v=vs.90).aspx)).
* Date
* Time
* ServerIP
* Method
* UriStem
* UriQuery
* Server Port
* UserName
* ClientIP
* UserAgent
* Referer
* Protocol Status
* Protocol Substatus
* Win32Status
* TimeTaken

For more information about the IIS 7 log (IIS 7.5 logs are used) format, see [https://www.iis.net/learn/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis](https://www.iis.net/learn/manage/provisioning-and-managing-iis/configure-logging-in-iis).

## Collecting Logs for IIS 7

This procedure explains how to enable logging from Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on your Windows server and ingest the logs into Sumo Logic.


### Prerequisites

To prepare for logging IIS 7 events, perform the following two tasks.

To enable logging on your IIS Server, do the following:
1. Open the Sever Manager Console
2. Select **Roles**
3. Select **Web Server (IIS)**
4. Select the host from which to collect IIS logs
5. In the right-hand pane, select **Logging**
6. For the option **One log file per select Site**
7. For the Log File Format, choose **W3C** so that you can select the fields to log
8. Click **Select Fields**, and then select the checkboxes for these fields:

Sumo Logic expects these fields in IIS logs for the IIS 7 Application and Field Extraction Rule by default.

* Date
* Time
* ServerIP
* Method
* UriStem
* UriQuery
* Server Port
* UserName
* ClientIP
* UserAgent
* Referer
* Protocol Status
* Protocol Substatus
* Win32Status
* TimeTaken
1. Click **OK** to save your configuration

To confirm that the log files are being created, do the following:

1. Open a command-line window and change directories to `C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles`. This is the same path you will enter when you configure the Source to collect these files.
2. Under the `\W3SVC1` directory, you should see one or more files with a `.log` extension. If the file is present, you can collect it.


### Step 1: Configure a Collector

Configure an [Installed Collector (Windows)](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows). Sumo Logic recommends that you install the collector on the same system that hosts the logs.


### Step 2: Configure a Source

To collect logs from IIS 7, use an Installed Collector and a Local File Source. You may also configure a [Remote File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-file-source), but the configuration is more complex. Sumo Logic recommends using a Local File Source if possible.

1. Configure a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Configure the Local File Source Fields as follows:
    1. **Name**: Required (for example, "IIS")
    2. **Description**. (Optional)
    3. **File Path** (Required).`C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles\W3SVC1\*.log`
    4. **Collection start time**. Choose how far back you would like to begin collecting historical logs. For example, choose 7 days ago to being collecting logs with a last modified date within the last seven days.
    5. **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the operating system by default, but you can enter a different host name.
    6. **Source Category** (Required). For example, "IIS_prod". (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details, see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    7. **Timestamp Parsing Settings**: Make sure the setting matches the timezone on the log files.
    8. **Enable Timestamp Parsing**: Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    9. **Time Zone**: Select the option to **Use time zone from log file. If none is present use:** and set the timezone to **UTC**.
    10. **Timestamp Format**: Select the option to **Automatically detect the format**.
    11. **Encoding**. UTF-8 is the default, but you can choose another encoding format from the menu if your IIS logs are encoded differently.
    12. **Enable Multiline Processing**. Disable the option to Detect messages spanning multiple lines. Because IIS logs are single line log files, disabling this option will improve performance of the collection and ensure that your messages are submitted correctly to Sumo Logic.
4. Click **Save**.

After a few minutes, your new Source should be propagated down to the Collector and will begin submitting your IIS log files to the Sumo Logic service.


## Field Extraction Rules

* **Name**: Microsoft IIS Logs
* **Scope**: Use the source category set above, such as "IIS_prod"
* **Parse Expression:**
```
parse regex "^[^#].*?(?<s_ip>\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}) (?<cs_method>\S+?)
(?<cs_uri_stem>\S+?) (?<cs_uri_query>\S+?) (?<s_port>\d+?) (?<cs_username>\S+?)
(?<c_ip>.+?) (?<cs_User_Agent>\S+?) (?<cs_Referer>\S+?) (?<sc_status>\d+?)
(?<sc_substatus>\d+?) (?<sc_win32_status>\d+?) (?<time_taken>\d+?)$"
```

## Installing the IIS 7 App

Now that you have set up collection for IIS 7, install the Sumo Logic App for IIS 7 to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards that monitor log events generated by IIS 7.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing IIS 7 Dashboards

**Each dashboard has a set of filters** that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level.

**Each panel has a set of filters** that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.

### Overview Dashboard

The **IIS 7 - Overview Dashboard** provides a high-level view of user visits by country, the number of requests and the response time, top applications used to make requests, operating systems (OSes) used, and the number of server errors.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-7-Overview.png')} alt="Overview Dashboard" />

### Server Operation - Errors

The **IIS 7 - Server Operation - Errors Dashboard** provides information on server errors by IP address, response code trends, HTTP errors by server IP address, and client errors by IP address.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/web-servers/IIS-7-Server-Operation-Errors.png')} alt="Server Operation - Errors" />

### Server Operation - Requests and Response Time

The **IIS 7 - Server Operation - Requests and Response Time Dashboard** provides information on requests by server IP address, the top 10 slowest web pages, the number of requests and the response time per timeslice, top 10 server IP addresses response throughput time in bytes per second, and cumulative response times percentiles.
