[Azure Load Balancer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) is an Azure service that allows you to evenly distribute incoming network traffic across a group of Azure VMs or instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set. This integration helps in monitoring inbound and outbound data throughput, outbound flows, and application endpoint's health  of your Load Balancers.

## Metric types

For Azure Load Balancer, you can collect the following metrics:

* **Load Balancer Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-network-loadbalancers-metrics) namespace.

For more information on supported metrics, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/monitor-load-balancer-reference#metrics).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Load Balancer you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example:  `Azure/LoadBalancer/Metrics`.

### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic.

1. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
2. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each Load Balancer that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   * Select `AllMetrics`.
   * Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

## Troubleshooting

### HTTP Logs and Metrics Source used by Azure Functions

To troubleshoot metrics collection, follow the instructions in [Collect Metrics from Azure Monitor > Troubleshooting metrics collection](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#troubleshooting-metrics-collection).
