[Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) provides an in-memory data store based on the Redis software. It offers both the Redis open-source (OSS Redis) and a commercial product from Redis Inc. (Redis Enterprise) as a managed service. This integration helps in tracking cache performance (miss rate, latency, read and write rate) and monitor resource usage (CPU, used memory, server load, and connections) of your instances.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Cache for Redis, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Connection logs**. These logs contains information about the connections to the cache for security and diagnostic purposes. To learn more about the [limitations of connection logging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-monitor-diagnostic-settings?tabs=basic-standard-premium#prerequisiteslimitations-of-connection-logging) and [schemas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-monitor-diagnostic-settings?tabs=basic-standard-premium#contents-of-the-connection-logs) collected for Azure Cache for Redis, refer to the Azure documentation.
* **Cache Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Cache/redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-cache-redis-metrics) and [Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-cache-redisenterprise-metrics) namespace. For more information on supported metrics, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-how-to-monitor#list-of-metrics).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Cache for Redis you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/RedisCache/Logs`, `Azure/RedisCache/Metrics`.

### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic.

1. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
2. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each Azure Cache for Redis that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   * Select `AllMetrics`.
   * Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

### Configure logs collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs cloud-to-cloud source in Sumo Logic portal, refer to our [Azure Event Hubs source documentation](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/).
2. To create the Diagnostic settings in Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-monitor-diagnostic-settings?tabs=basic-standard-premium#enable-connection-logging-using-the-azure-portal). Perform below steps for each Azure Cache for Redis that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   * Select `ConnectedClientList` for Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers and `Connection events` for Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers.
   * Use the Event hub namespace and Event hub name configured in previous step in destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

## Troubleshooting

### Azure Event Hubs Source

Common error types are described [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/#error-types).

You can try [restarting](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/#restarting-your-source) the source for `ThirdPartyConfig` errors.

### HTTP Logs and Metrics Source used by Azure Functions

To troubleshoot metrics collection, follow the instructions in [Collect Metrics from Azure Monitor > Troubleshooting metrics collection](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#troubleshooting-metrics-collection).
