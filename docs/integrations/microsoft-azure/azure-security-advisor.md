## Setup

To send Azure Advisor events to Sumo Logic, you can configure the [Azure Advisor’s alert](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-alerts-portal) with [Action group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) as a webhook.

### Step 1: Configure Sumo Logic HTTP source

[Create Sumo Logic HTTP source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source) and make a note of the HTTP URL.

### Step 2: Create an Azure Advisor alert

Refer to [Create Azure Advisor alerts in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/advisor/advisor-alerts-portal) to configure an Azure Advisor alert for Sumo Logic.
Sumo Logic recommends you to select the **Category and impact level** option in the **Condition** section while creating the alert.
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/create-advisor-alert.png')} alt="Edit Advisor alert" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

### Step 3: Create an action group

Refer to [Create an action group in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups#create-an-action-group-in-the-azure-portal) to create an action group for the Azure Advisor alert in step 2.

Sumo Logic recommends you to select the **Action type** as **Webhook** and then provide the Sumo Logic HTTP Source URL that you collected from step 1.
