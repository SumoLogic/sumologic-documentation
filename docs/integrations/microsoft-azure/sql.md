Azure SQL Database is a managed relational cloud database service. The Sumo Logic app for Azure SQL helps you monitor activity in Azure SQL. The preconfigured dashboards provide insight into resource utilization, blocking queries, database wait events, errors, runtime execution stats, and other database analytics.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic app for Azure SQL app uses the following log types:

* Metric
* QueryStoreRuntimeStatisticsEvent
* QueryStoreWaitStatisticsEvent
* DatabaseWaitStatisticsEvent
* BlockEvent
* ErrorEvent
* Insight
* TimeoutEvent

For details on Azure SQL logs and metrics, see [Enable logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-metrics-diag-logging#enable-logging) in Azure help.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics

This section has instructions for collecting logs and metrics for the Azure SQL app, as well as a sample log message and a query sample.

### Collect diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor by streaming to EventHub

In this step, you configure a pipeline for shipping logs from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) to an Event Hub.

1. Sumo Logic supports several methods for collecting logs from Event Hub. You can choose any of them to collect logs.

	- [Azure Event Hubs Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/) (Recommended)
	- Perform Steps 1 and Step 2 of [Collect Logs from Azure Monitor using Azure Functions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-logs-azure-monitor/#configure-log-collection)

	When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/DB/SQL/Logs`.

2. Push logs from Azure Monitor to Event Hub. Various Azure Services connect to Azure Monitor to send monitoring data to an Event Hub. For more information, see [Azure Monitor: Send monitoring data to an event hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-monitor-send-monitoring-data-to-an-event-hub/) and How do I set up [Azure platform monitoring data to be streamed to an event hub?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs#how-do-i-set-up-azure-platform-monitoring-data-to-be-streamed-to-an-event-hub) in Azure help.
	1. Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
	2. Click **Azure SQL**. Select the SQL database from which you want to collect logs.
	3. In the Monitoring Section, the **Diagnostic Settings** blade displays any existing settings. Click **Edit Setting** if you want to change your existing settings, or click **Add diagnostic setting** to add a new one. You can have a maximum of three settings.
	4. Enter a name.
	5. Check the **Stream to an event hub** box and click **Event hub / Configure**.
	6. Select an Azure subscription.
	7. **Event bub namespace.** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hubs Source) for collecting logs, select the **EventHubNamespace** created manually, or else if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select `SumoAzureLogsNamespace<UniqueSuffix>` namespace created by the ARM template.
	8. **Event hub name (optional).** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hub Source) for collecting logs, select the event hub name, which you created manually, or if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select **insights-operational-logs**.
	9. Select **RootManageSharedAccessKey** from **Select event hub policy name** dropdown.
	10. Select the **Audit** label under **Logs**.
	11. Click **Save**.

### Collect metrics from Azure Monitor by streaming to EventHub

In this step, you configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic. The pipeline is described on [Collect Metrics from Azure Monitor](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor.md).

1. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source). Plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/DB/SQL/Metrics`
2. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each Azure SQL Database that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   * Select all the metric types under `Metrics` section.
   * Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name. This should be same as configured in the Sumo Logic Function App **Integration** > **Trigger** settings.
