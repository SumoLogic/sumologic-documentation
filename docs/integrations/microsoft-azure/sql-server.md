The Sumo Logic App for Microsoft SQL Server is an unified logs and metrics app that provides insight into your SQL server performance metrics and errors. The App consists of predefined Dashboards, providing visibility into your environment for real-time or historical analysis on backup, latency, performance counter, restore, mirroring, database monitoring, general health and operations of your system.

This App has been tested with following SQL Server versions:
* Microsoft SQL Server 2012


## Collecting logs and metrics for the Microsoft SQL Server App

This section provides instructions for configuring a local file source to collect SQL Server ERRORLOG data, and a script source to collect SQL Server performance metrics. A sample log message is also provided.

### Collect Logs and Metrics
Sumo Logic supports collection of logs and metrics data from SQL Server in both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Click on the appropriate tabs below based on the environment where your SQL Server clusters are hosted.

<Tabs
  groupId="k8s-nonk8s"
  defaultValue="k8s"
  values={[
    {label: 'Kubernetes environments', value: 'k8s'},
    {label: 'Non-Kubernetes environments', value: 'non-k8s'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="k8s">

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with the Kubernetes collection ([learn more](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture)). The diagram below illustrates how data is collected from SQL Server in Kubernetes environments. In the architecture shown below, there are four services that make up the metric collection pipeline: Telegraf, Telegraf Operator, Prometheus, and [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector). <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/sqlk8s.png')} alt="sqlk8s.png" />

The first service in the pipeline is Telegraf. Telegraf collects metrics from SQL Server. Note that we are running Telegraf as a sidecar deployment in each pod from which we want to collect metrics. This means that Telegraf is running in the same pod as the containers it monitors. Telegraf uses the [SQL Server input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) to obtain metrics. For simplicity, the diagram doesn’t show the input plugins.
The injection of the Telegraf sidecar container is done by the Telegraf Operator.
Prometheus pulls metrics from Telegraf and sends them to [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) which enriches metadata and sends metrics to Sumo Logic.

In the logs pipeline, Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector collects logs written to standard out and forwards them to another instance of Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector, which enriches metadata and sends logs to Sumo Logic.


Follow the below instructions to set up the metric collection:

1. Configure Metrics Collection
   * Setup Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf operator
   * Add annotations on your SQL Server pods
2. Configure Logs Collection
   * Configure logging in SQL Server.
   * Add labels on your SQL Server pods to capture logs from standard output.
   * Collecting SQL Server Logs from a Log file.

**Prerequisites**

It’s assumed that you are using the latest helm chart version. If not, upgrade using the instructions [here](/docs/send-data/kubernetes).


#### Step 1: Configure Metrics Collection

This section explains the steps to collect SQL Server metrics from a Kubernetes environment.

In Kubernetes environments, we use the Telegraf Operator, which is packaged with our Kubernetes collection. [Learn more](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/telegraf-collection-architecture). Follow the steps listed below to collect metrics from a Kubernetes environment:

1. **[Set up Kubernetes Collection with the Telegraf Operator](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf)**.
2. **Add annotations on your SQL Server pods**. Before you add annotations, you need to create a login on every SQL Server pod  you want to monitor, with following script:
  ```sql
  USE master;
  GO
  CREATE LOGIN [Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED] WITH PASSWORD=N'Password_CHANGE_ME';
  GO
  GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED];
  GO
  GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED];
  GO
  ```
  On your SQL Server Pods, add the following annotations:
  ```sql
   annotations:
      telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus
      prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
      prometheus.io/port: "9273"
      telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs: |+
  [[inputs.sql server]]
      servers = ["Server=<IP_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;Port=<Port_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED| default 1433>;User Id=<Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;Password=<Password_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;app name=telegraf;log=1;",]
     database_type = "SQLServer"
     exclude_query =  [ 'SQLServerSchedulers' , 'SQLServerRequests']
       [inputs.sqlserver.tags]
      environment="ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      component="database"
      db_system = "sqlserver"
      db_cluster = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
      db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
  ```
  Enter in values for the following parameters (marked `ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED` in the snippet above):
  * `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. This contains the required configuration for the Telegraf SQL Server Input plugin. Refer [to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/redis) for more information on configuring the SQL Server input plugin for Telegraf. Note: As telegraf will be run as a sidecar the host should always be localhost.
  * In the input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.sqlserver]]`:
      * **servers**. The URL to the SQLserver server. This can be a comma-separated list to connect to multiple SQLserver servers. Refer [to this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) for more information on additional parameters for configuring the SQLserver input plugin for Telegraf.
  * In the tags section, which is `[inputs.sqlserver.tags]`
      * **environment**. This is the deployment environment where the SQLserver cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod, or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
      * **db_cluster**. Enter a name to identify this SQLserver cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
      * **db_cluster_address**. Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
      * **db_cluster_port**. Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.

      :::note
      `db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

      For example, if your app uses `“sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`.

      If your application connects directly to a given SQL server node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com`.

      Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “SQLServer address” Entities.
      :::

**Do not modify the following values,** as they will cause the Sumo Logic apps to not function correctly.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/class: sumologic-prometheus`. This instructs the Telegraf operator what output to use. This should not be changed.
* `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`. This ensures our Prometheus will scrape the metrics.
* `prometheus.io/port: "9273"`. This tells prometheus what ports to scrape on. This should not be changed.
* `telegraf.influxdata.com/inputs`. In the tags section, which is `[inputs.sqlserver.tags]`:
   * `component: “database”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
   * `db_system: “sqlserver”`. This value identifies the database system.

    For all other parameters, see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

3. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting metrics from the pods having the labels and annotations defined in the previous step.
4. Verify metrics in Sumo Logic.


#### Step 2: Configure Logs Collection

This section explains the steps to collect SQL Server logs from a Kubernetes environment.

1. **(Recommended Method) Add labels on your SQL server pods to capture logs from standard output**. Make sure that the logs from SQL Server are sent to stdout. Follow the instructions below to capture SQL Server logs from stdout on Kubernetes.

1. Apply following labels to the SQL server pods:
   ```sql
   environment: "prod_CHANGE_ME"
   component: "database"
   db_system: "SQLserver"
   db_cluster: "SQLserver_prod_CHANGE_ME"
   ```
   Enter in values for the following parameters (marked **CHANGE_ME** above):
   * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the SQL server cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example: dev, prod or qa. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
   * `db_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this SQL server cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.

        **Do not modify** the following values set by this configuration as it will cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.

   * `component: “database”`. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
   * `db_system: “SQLserver”`. This value identifies the database system.
   * `db_cluster_address`. Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
   * `db_cluster_port`. Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.

   :::note
   `db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for net.peer.name and net.peer.port metadata fields).

   For example, if your application uses `“sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

   If your application connects directly to a given SQL server node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the “host” field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com`

   Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “SQLServer address” Entities.
   :::

   For all other parameters, please see [this doc](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf#configuring-telegraf) for more parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

   * The Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection will automatically capture the logs from stdout and will send the logs to Sumologic. For more information on deploying Sumologic-Kubernetes-Collection, [visit](/docs/integrations/containers-orchestration/kubernetes#collecting-metrics-and-logs-for-the-kubernetes-app) here.
   * Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
2. (Optional) Collecting SQL server Logs from a Log File. Follow the steps below to capture SQL server logs from a log file on Kubernetes.
1. Determine the location of the SQL server log file on Kubernetes. This can be determined from the SQLserver.conf for your SQL server cluster along with the mounts on the SQL server pods.
2. Install the Sumo Logic [tailing sidecar operator](https://github.com/SumoLogic/tailing-sidecar/tree/main/operator#deploy-tailing-sidecar-operator).
3. Add the following annotation in addition to the existing annotations.
   ```
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;<mount>:<path_of_SQLserver_log_file>/<SQLserver_log_file_name>
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   annotations:
     tailing-sidecar: sidecarconfig;data:/var/opt/mssql/errorlog
   ```

1. Make sure that the SQL server pods are running and annotations are applied by using the command:
   ```xml
   kubectl describe pod <SQLserver_pod_name>
   ```
2. Sumo Logic Kubernetes collection will automatically start collecting logs from the pods having the annotations defined above.
3. Verify logs in Sumo Logic.
4. Add a FER to normalize the fields in Kubernetes environments. Labels created in Kubernetes environments automatically are prefixed with pod_labels. To normalize these for our app to work, we need to create a Field Extraction Rule if not already created for Proxy Application Components. To do so:
  1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Field Extraction Rules**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Field Extraction Rules**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Field Extraction Rules**.  
  2. Click the **+ Add Rule** button on the top right of the table.
  3. The **Add Field Extraction Rule** form will appear.
  4. Enter the following options:
     * **Rule Name**. Enter the name as **App Observability - Proxy**.
     * **Applied At**. Choose **Ingest Time**
     * **Scope**. Select **Specific Data**
     * **Scope**. Enter the following keyword search expression:
        ```sql
         pod_labels_environment=* pod_labels_component=database
         pod_labels_db_system=*
         pod_labels_db_cluster=*
        ```
     * **Parse Expression**. Enter the following parse expression:
    
       ```sql
       if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_environment), pod_labels_environment, "") as environment
       | pod_labels_component as component
       | pod_labels_db_system as db_system
       | if (!isEmpty(pod_labels_db_cluster), pod_labels_db_cluster, null) as db_cluster
       ```
1. Click **Save** to create the rule.

<TabItem value="non-k8s">

In Non-Kubernetes environments, Sumo Logic uses the Telegraf operator for SQL Server metric collection and the [Installed Collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) for collecting SQL Server logs. The diagram below illustrates the components of the SQL Server collection in a non-Kubernetes environment. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/sql-nonk8s.png')} alt="sql-nonk8s.png" />

Telegraf uses the [SQL Server input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) to obtain SQL Server metrics and the Sumo Logic output plugin to send the metrics to Sumo Logic. Logs from SQL Server are collected by a [Local File source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).


The process to set up collection for SQL Server data is done through the following steps:

1. Configure Logs Collection
    * Configure logging in SQL Server
    * Configure Sumo Logic Installed Collector
    * Configure a local file source
    * Save
2. Configure Metrics Collection
    * Configure a Hosted Collector
    * Configure an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source
    * Install Telegraf
    * Configure and start Telegraf


#### Configure Logs Collection

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for SQL Server running on a non-Kubernetes environment for the Sumo Logic App for SQL Server.

1. **Make sure logging is turned on in SQL Server.** Follow [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/scm-services-configure-sql-server-error-logs?view=sql-server-ver15) to enable it.

   The Microsoft SQL Server App’s queries and dashboards depend on logs from the SQL Server `ERRORLOG`, which is typically found at: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG \`. The `ERRORLOG` is typically in UTF-16LE encoding, but verify the file encoding used in your SQL Server configuration. On Windows, this can be found by using a tool such as Notepad++.
2. **Configure an Installed Collector.** If you have not already done so, install and configure an installed collector for Windows by [following the documentation](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows).
3. **Configure a local file source** to ingest the `ERRORLOG`.
   * On the Collection Management screen, click Add, next to the collector, then select Add Source.
   * Select Local File as the source type.
   * Configure the Local File Source fields as follows:
      * Name (Required). Enter a name for the source.
      * Description (Optional).
      * File Path (Required). Enter the path to your `ERRORLOG` and be sure to account for log rotations by using a wildcard: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG*`
      * Collection should begin. Set this for how far back historically you want to start collecting.
      * Source Host (Optional). Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the OS unless you enter a different host name
      * Source Category (Recommended). Be sure to follow the [Best Practices for Source Categories](/docs/send-data/best-practices). A recommended Source Category may be `Prod/DB/MSSQL/ERRORLOG.`
     * Fields. Set the following fields:
       * `component = database`
       * `db_system = SQLserver`
       * `db_cluster = <Your_SQLserver_Cluster_Name>`.Enter Default if you do not have one`.`
       * `environment = <Your_Environment_Name> `(for example, `Dev`, `QA`, or `Prod`)
       * `db_cluster_address`. Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
       * `db_cluster_port`. Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.

       :::note
       `db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

       For example, if your application uses `“sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

       If your application connects directly to a given SQL server node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the `“host”` field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com`

       Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “SQLServer address” Entities.
       :::
4. In the **Advanced** section, select the following options:
   * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** Select Extract timestamp information from log file entries.
   * **Time Zone.** Choose the option, **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and then select your SQL Server Server’s time zone.
   * **Timestamp Format.** The timestamp format is automatically detected.
   * **Encoding.** Select the encoding of the `ERRORLOG` you found in step 1, which will typically be **UTF-16LE**.
   * **Enable Multiline Processing.** Detect messages spanning multiple lines
     * **Infer Boundaries**. Detect message boundaries automatically
5. Click **Save**.

At this point, the installed collector will start scanning the `ERRORLOG` and send it to Sumo Logic.


#### Configure Metrics Collection

Set up a Sumo Logic HTTP Source

1. **Configure a Hosted Collector for Metrics**. To create a new Sumo Logic hosted collector, perform the steps in the [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) documentation.
2. Configure an HTTP Logs & Metrics source:
   * On the created Hosted Collector on the Collection Management screen, select **Add Source**.
   * Select **HTTP Logs & Metrics.**
      * **Name.** (Required). Enter a name for the source.
      * **Description.** (Optional).
      * **Source Category** (Recommended)**.** Be sure to follow the [Best Practices for Source Categories](/docs/send-data/best-practices). A recommended Source Category may be Prod/DB/MSSQL/Metrics.
3. Click **Save**.
4. Take note of the URL provided once you click **Save**. You can retrieve it again by selecting **Show URL** next to the source on the Collection Management screen.


##### Set up Telegraf

1. **Install Telegraf if you haven’t already.** Use the[ following steps](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf/install-telegraf.md) to install Telegraf.
2. **Configure and start Telegraf.** As part of collecting metrics data from Telegraf, we will use the[ SQL Server input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver) to get data from Telegraf and the[ Sumo Logic output plugin](https://github.com/SumoLogic/fluentd-output-sumologic) to send data to Sumo Logic.  

  Before you configure Telegraf, you will need to create a[ login on every SQL Server](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver#additional-setup) instance you want to monitor with the following script. This script will create a user in SQL Server which will be used as input to the Telegraf configuration.

```
USE master;
GO
CREATE LOGIN [<Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>] WITH PASSWORD=N'<Password_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>';
GO
GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO [<Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>];
GO
GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [<Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>];
GO
```

Create or modify `telegraf.conf` and copy and paste the text below:  

```sql
[[inputs.sqlserver]]
  servers = [ "Server=<IP_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;Port=<Port_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;User Id=<Username_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;Password=<Password_ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>;app name=telegraf;log=1;",]
  database_type = "SQLServer"
  exclude_query = [ 'SQLServerSchedulers' , 'SQLServerRequests' ]
  tagexclude = ['physical_filename','volume_mount_point']
    [inputs.sqlserver.tags]
       environment="prod"
       component="database"
       db_cluster= "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
       db_cluster_address = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
       db_cluster_port = "ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED"
       db_system = "sqlserver"
[[outputs.sumologic]]
  url = "<URL_from_HTTP_Logs_and_Metrics_Source>"
  data_format = "prometheus"
```

Enter values for fields annotated with `<ENV_TO_BE_CHANGED>` to the appropriate values. Do not include the brackets (`< >`) in your final configuration:
* Input plugins section, which is `[[inputs.sqlserver]]`:
    * `servers`. The URL to the SQL server. For more information on additional parameters to configure the SQL Server input plugin for Telegraf see[ this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/sqlserver).
* In the tags section, which is `[inputs.sqlserver.tags]`:
    * `environment`. This is the deployment environment where the SQL Server cluster identified by the value of **servers** resides. For example; dev, prod, or QA. While this value is optional we highly recommend setting it.
    * `db_cluster`. Enter a name to identify this SQLserver cluster. This cluster name will be shown in our dashboards.
    * `db_cluster_address`. Enter the cluster hostname or ip address that is used by the application to connect to the database. It could also be the load balancer or proxy endpoint.
    * `db_cluster_port`. Enter the database port. If not provided, a default port will be used.

    :::note
    `db_cluster_address` and `db_cluster_port` should reflect the exact configuration of DB client configuration in your application, especially if you instrument it with OT tracing. The values of these fields should match exactly the connection string used by the database client (reported as values for `net.peer.name` and `net.peer.port` metadata fields).

    For example, if your application uses `“sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com:3306”` as the connection string, the field values should be set as follows: `db_cluster_address=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com db_cluster_port=3306`

    If your application connects directly to a given SQL server node, rather than the whole cluster, use the application connection string to override the value of the `“host”` field in the Telegraf configuration: `host=sqlserver-prod.sumologic.com`

    Pivoting to Tracing data from Entity Inspector is possible only for “SQLServer address” Entities.
    :::

* In the output plugins section, which is `[[outputs.sumologic]]`:
    * **URL**. This is the HTTP source URL created previously. See this doc for more information on additional parameters for configuring the Sumo Logic Telegraf output plugin.

    Here’s an explanation for additional values set by this Telegraf configuration.

If you haven’t defined a cluster in SQL Server, then enter `default` for `db_cluster`.

There are additional values set by the Telegraf configuration.  We recommend not to modify  these values as they might cause the Sumo Logic app to not function correctly.
* `data_format: “prometheus”`. In the output `[[outputs.sumologic]]` plugins section. Metrics are sent in the Prometheus format to Sumo Logic.
* `component = “database”`. In the input `[[inputs.SQLserver]]` plugins section. This value is used by Sumo Logic apps to identify application components.
* `db_system = “sqlserver”`. In the input plugins sections. This value identifies the database system.

    See [this doc](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/master/etc/logrotate.d/telegraf) for all other parameters that can be configured in the Telegraf agent globally.

After you've finalized your `telegraf.conf` file, you can start or reload the telegraf service using instructions from [this doc](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.17/introduction/getting-started/#start-telegraf-service).

At this point, Telegraf should start collecting the SQL Server metrics and forward them to the Sumo Logic HTTP Source.
