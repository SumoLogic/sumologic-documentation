This guide helps you set up Sumo Logic Collectors, and install the PCI Compliance for Windows Legacy application, so you can begin monitoring your usage and determine if you are meeting Compliance benchmarks.

## Log types

The PCI Compliance For Windows Legacy App uses Windows Security Event and System Event logs. It does not work with third-party logs.

### Sample log messages

```
instance of Win32_NTLogEvent
{
    Category = 13571;
    CategoryString = "MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change";
    ComputerName = "aphrodite.sumolab.org";
    EventCode = 4957;
    EventIdentifier = 4957;
    EventType = 5;
    InsertionStrings = {"CoreNet-IPHTTPS-In", "Core Networking - IPHTTPS (TCP-In)", "Local Port"};
    Logfile = "Security";
    Message = "Windows Firewall did not apply the following rule:

    Rule Information:
    ID: CoreNet-IPHTTPS-In
    Name: Core Networking - IPHTTPS (TCP-In)

    Error Information:
    Reason: Local Port resolved to an empty set.";
    RecordNumber = 1441653878;
    SourceName = "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing";
    TimeGenerated = "20130411232352.140400-000";
    TimeWritten = "20130411232352.140400-000";
    Type = "Audit Failure";
};
```


### Sample queries

```sql title="Recent Policy Changes"
_sourceCategory=OS/Windows/Events "Policy Change"
| parse regex "CategoryString = \"(?<category>[^\"]+?)\";[\s\S]+?Logfile = \"Security\""
| count by category
| where category matches "*Policy Change*"
```


## Collecting Logs

This section provides instructions for configuring log collection for the PCI Compliance for Windows Legacy App.


### Configure a Collector and a Source  

To configure a collector and source, do the following:

1. Configure an [Installed Windows collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows) through the user interface or from the command line.
2. Configure either a local or remote Windows Event Log source. To configure a Windows Event Log source set the following:
    * **Event Format.** Select **Collect using legacy format.** Events retain their default text format from Windows.

For more information on local or remote Windows Event Log Source configuration, refer to [Local Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-event-log-source) and [Remote Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-event-log-source).

Make sure to set the Source Category when configuring the Windows Event Log source. For example: `OS/Windows/Events`.
