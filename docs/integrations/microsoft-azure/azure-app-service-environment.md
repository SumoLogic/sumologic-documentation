An [Azure App Service Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/overview) is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps securely at high scale. This integration helps in monitoring your environments operational events such as upgrades, scaling, and suspensions.

The below instructions applies to App Service Environment v3.

## Log and metric types

For Azure App Service Environment, you can collect the following logs:

* **Activity logs**, provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in the Azure. To learn more, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

* **App Service Environment Platform Logs**. Logs are only emitted when your App Service Environment has an event (for example, a scale operation with an App Service Environment) that triggers the logs. To learn more about the different situations and messages collected for Azure App Service Environment, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/using#logging).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure App Service Environment you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/AppServiceEnvironment/Logs`, `Azure/AppServiceEnvironment/Metrics`.

### Configure field in field schema

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**.
1. Search for following fields:
   - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level and you can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
   - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
   - `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where resource is present.
   - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
   - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.WEB).
   - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, SITES).
   - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, Azure Function App name).
1. Create the fields if they are not present. Refer to [Manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure Field Extraction Rules

Create a Field Extraction Rule (FER) by following the instructions [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/). If the FER already exists with same name, then skip this step.

#### Azure location extraction FER

```sql
Rule Name: AzureLocationExtractionFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
```

```sql title="Parse Expression"
json "location", "properties.resourceLocation", "properties.region" as location, resourceLocation, service_region nodrop
| replace(toLowerCase(resourceLocation), " ", "") as resourceLocation
| if (!isBlank(resourceLocation), resourceLocation, location) as location
| if (!isBlank(service_region), service_region, location) as location
| if (isBlank(location), "global", location) as location
| fields location
```

#### Resource ID extraction FER

```sql
Rule Name: AzureResourceIdExtractionFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=*
```

```sql title="Parse Expression"
json "resourceId", "ResourceId" as resourceId1, resourceId2 nodrop
| if (isBlank(resourceId1), resourceId2, resourceId1) as resourceId
| toUpperCase(resourceId) as resourceId
| parse regex field=resourceId "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/(?<subscription_id>[^/]+)" nodrop
| parse field=resourceId "/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/" as resource_group nodrop
| parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/(?<provider_name>[^/]+)" nodrop
| parse regex field=resourceId "/PROVIDERS/[^/]+(?:/LOCATIONS/[^/]+)?/(?<resource_type>[^/]+)/(?<resource_name>.+)" nodrop
| parse regex field=resource_name "(?<parent_resource_name>[^/]+)(?:/PROVIDERS/[^/]+)?/(?<service_type>[^/]+)/?(?<service_name>.+)" nodrop
| if (isBlank(parent_resource_name), resource_name, parent_resource_name) as resource_name
| fields subscription_id, location, provider_name, resource_group, resource_type, resource_name, service_type, service_name
```

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
2. To create the **Diagnostic setting** in the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the below steps for each Azure App Service Environment that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `App Service Environment Platform Logs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in previous step in destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.

3. Tag the location field in the source with right location value.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure App Service Environment Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity logs (optional)

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). If you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription, do not perform this step.
