Use theÂ [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for Microsoft Graph Security API](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/microsoft-graph-security-api-source/) to ingest security alerts data from the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to the Sumo Logic platform.

## Search alerts

Use the following query to retrieve alerts generated by the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

```sql
_sourcecategory=Labs/MicrosoftGraphSecurity
| json field=_raw "serviceSource" as service_source
| where service_source = "microsoftDefenderForEndpoint"
```

## Analyse alerts

Use the following query to extract detailed insights from the alert data:

```sql
_sourceCategory=Labs/MicrosoftGraphSecurity  
|json"id","status","severity","category","title","description","classification","determination","serviceSource","detectionSource","alertWebUrl" ,"comments[*]","evidence[*]"as  alert_id,status,severity,category,title,description,classification,determination,service_source,detection_source,alert_url,comments,evidence_info nodrop
| where service_source = "microsoftDefenderForEndpoint"
| where severity matches "*" and status matches "*" and classification matches "*" 
| if(isNull(category),"-",category) as category
| if(isNull(classification),"-",classification) as classification
| if(isNull(determination),"-",determination) as determination
| count by _messageTime,status,severity,category,title,description,classification,determination,alert_url,alert_id
| formatDate(toLong(_messageTime), "dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss") as time
| tourl (alert_url,alert_id) as alert_id
| fields time,alert_id,title,description,alert_url,status,severity,category,classification,determination
| fields -_messageTime    
| sort by time
```
