## Collection configuration and app installation

:::note
Skip this step if you have already configured the [Microsoft Graph Security API](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/microsoft-graph-security-api-source/) Source. **[Use an existing source and install the app](#use-an-existing-source-and-install-the-app)** option to install the app using the `_sourceCategory` of Microsoft Graph Security API Source.
:::

import CollectionConfiguration from '../../reuse/apps/collection-configuration.md';

<CollectionConfiguration/>

### Create a new collector and install the app

import AppCollectionOPtion1 from '../../reuse/apps/app-collection-option-1.md';

<AppCollectionOPtion1/>

### Use an existing collector and install the app

import AppCollectionOPtion2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-collection-option-2.md';

<AppCollectionOPtion2/>

### Use an existing source and install the app

import AppCollectionOPtion3 from '../../reuse/apps/app-collection-option-3.md';

<AppCollectionOPtion3/>

:::important
Use the [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for Microsoft Graph Security API](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/microsoft-graph-security-api-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Microsoft Graph Security API app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your security alerts data.

## Viewing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint dashboards​

import ViewDashboards from '../../reuse/apps/view-dashboards.md';

<ViewDashboards/>

### Overview

The **Azure Security - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Overview** dashboard offers a detailed view into security threats detected across endpoints, enabling analysts to assess and act swiftly on potential incidents. With a broad set of visualizations, it displays total alerts, high-severity alerts, and their distribution by status, classification, determination, service source, and detection source.

Security teams can quickly identify which alert categories are most prevalent, view recent alerts for immediate awareness, and also track which analysts are actively assigned to incidents. By highlighting the top users linked to alerts, the dashboard helps uncover potential insider threats or compromised accounts that require further investigation.

Geo-location mapping visualizes the alert origin, supporting risk assessment tied to specific regions. Together, these insights provide a balanced blend of historical context and real-time visibility, empowering teams to prioritize high-impact threats and respond effectively.

Overall, this dashboard serves as an essential tool for maintaining situational awareness, tracking alert trends, and strengthening your organization’s response strategy against evolving endpoint threats.<br/><img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-for-Endpoint/Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-for-Endpoint-Overview.png' alt="Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-for-Endpoint-Overview" />

### Security

The **Azure Security - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - Security** dashboard delivers a high-level view of your organization’s endpoint threat landscape, helping teams identify where risks concentrate and how they evolve over time. Visual trend panels illustrate changes in alert severity, revealing whether high-risk incidents are increasing and guiding prioritization of response efforts.

Geo-location data highlights alerts emerging from risky countries, allowing teams to assess exposure to region-specific threats. The dashboard also surfaces critical context, such as the top user accounts with compromised roles, which can signal targeted attacks on privileged accounts.

In addition, the dashboard ranks the most frequently attacked devices and countries linked to suspicious or malicious IP activity, offering clarity on which assets and locations are most at risk. This intelligence supports more targeted defenses and timely intervention.

By combining trend analysis, threat origins, and user risk insights, the Security dashboard equips analysts to recognize patterns, respond to emerging threats proactively, and bolster the organization’s overall security posture against complex endpoint attacks.<br/><img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-for-Endpoint/Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-fo-Endpoint-Security.png' alt="Azure-Security-Microsoft-Defender-fo-Endpoint-Security" />
