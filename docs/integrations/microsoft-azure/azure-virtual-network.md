[Azure Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview) is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure enabling many types of Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, using the internet, and on-premises networks. This integration helps in monitoring the outgoing and incoming traffic flows, dropped packets, bandwidth consumption, verifying network isolation and compliance.

## Logs and metric types

For Azure Virtual Network, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Virtual network flow logs**. It provides ingress and egress IP traffic flow with the following information:

   * Inbound and Outbound flows per Rule
   * NIC and traffic flow
   * 5-tuple information with respect to flow (Source/Destination IP and Port, Protocol)
   * Allowed/Denied traffic flow.
   * Encryption status of your traffic

   For more information, refer to the [virtual flow logs documentations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-overview).

* **Platform Metrics for Azure Virtual Network**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-network-virtualnetworks-metrics) namespace.

```


## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Virtual Network Flow Logs collection from Storage Account using our [Collect Logs from Azure Blob Storage](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-blob-storage/block-blob/collect-logs) integration.
* Activity Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/). It is recommended to create a separate source for activity logs. If you are already collecting these logs, you can skip this step.
* Metrics collection using our [HTTP Logs and Metrics source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/) via Azure Functions deployed using the ARM template.


You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings and network flow logs for each Virtual Network you want to monitor. You can forward metrics to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/VirtualNetwork/Metrics` and `Azure/VirtualNetwork/Logs`.

### Configure field in field schema
1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Fields**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Fields**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Fields**.
1. Search for following fields:
   - `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level and users can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
   - `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
   - `subscription_id`. Id associated with a subscription where resource is present.
   - `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
   - `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for  ex Microsoft.Storage).
   - `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for ex storageaccounts).
   - `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for ex storage account name).

3. Create the fields if it is not present. Refer to [create and manage fields](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

### Configure Field Extraction Rules

Create a Field Extraction Rule (FER) for Azure Virtual Network by following the instructions [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule/).

* **Target Resource Extraction FER**

   ```sql
   Rule Name: AzureVirtualNetworkTargetResourceIdExtractionFER
   Applied at: Ingest Time
   Scope (Specific Data): tenant_name=* FlowLogFlowEvent
   ```

   ```sql title="Parse Expression"
   json field=_raw "target_resource_id", "category", "flow_log_resource_id"
   | where category="FlowLogFlowEvent"
   | toUpperCase(target_resource_id) as target_resource_id
   | parse field=target_resource_id "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/*/*/*" as subscription_id, resource_group, provider_name, resource_type, resource_name
   | parse field=resource_name "*/SUBNETS/*" as vnet_name, subnet_name nodrop
   | parse field=flow_log_resource_id "NETWORKWATCHERS/NETWORKWATCHER_*/" as region_name nodrop
   | if (!isBlank(region_name), toLowerCase(region_name), "global") as location
   | if (resource_name matches /SUBNETS/, "SUBNETS", resource_type) as resource_type
   | fields subscription_id, location, provider_name, resource_group, resource_type, resource_name
   ```

### Configure metric rules

  * **Azure Observability Metadata Extraction Azure Virtual Network**

      In case this rule is already exists then no need to create again.
```sql
Rule Name: AzureObservabilityMetadataExtractionAzureVirtualNetwork
```

```sql title="Metric match expression"
resourceId=/SUBSCRIPTIONS/*/RESOURCEGROUPS/*/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/VIRTUALNETWORKS/* tenant_name=*
```
| Fields extracted | Metric rule    |
|------------------|----------------|
| subscription_id  | $resourceId._1 |
| resource_group   | $resourceId._2 |
| provider_name    | MICROSOFT.NETWORK |
| resource_type    | VIRTUALNETWORKS |
| resource_name    | $resourceId._3 |

### Configure metrics collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping metrics from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub, on to an Azure Function, and finally to an HTTP Source on a hosted collector in Sumo Logic. This step is required only for DDOS related metrics which comes after enabling DDOS protection in your virtual network.

1. Create hosted collector and tag `tenant_name` field. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Storage Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
2. [Configure an HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-1-configure-an-http-source).
2. [Configure and deploy the ARM Template](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-2-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template).
3. [Export metrics to Event Hub](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-metrics-azure-monitor/#step-3-export-metrics-for-a-particular-resource-to-event-hub). Perform below steps for each storage service (blob,queue,table and file) and each storage account that you want to monitor.
   * Choose `Stream to an event hub` as destination.
   * Select `AllMetrics`.
   * Use the Event hub namespace created by the ARM template in Step 2 above. You can create a new Event hub or use the one created by ARM template. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.
4. Tag the location field in the source with right location value.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Storage Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
5. Enable the `DDOS protection` by following the instructions in Azure [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection#enable-for-an-existing-virtual-network)

### Configure logs collection

#### Configuration requirements

Before you begin configuring Virtual Network Flow Log collection, make sure the following environment prerequisites are met:

* Your Storage Account must be of type General-purpose v2 or Blob storage.
* Your Network Security Group and Storage Account should be in same resource location.
* You also need to have Microsoft Authorization/role Assignments/write permissions, so they should be a "User Access Administrator" or "Owner".
* Location: The storage account must be in the same region as the virtual network.
* Subscription: The storage account must be in the same subscription of the virtual network or in a subscription associated with the same Microsoft Entra tenant of the virtual network's subscription.
* Performance tier: The storage account must be standard. Premium storage accounts aren't supported.
* Self-managed key rotation: If you change or rotate the access keys to your storage account, virtual network flow logs stop working. To fix this problem, you must disable and then re-enable virtual network flow logs.

Resource group names should not contains underscores (`_`).

#### Step 1: Configure Azure Storage Account

In this step, you'll configure a storage account to export monitoring data for your Azure service.
The storage account must be a General-purpose v2 (GPv2) storage account. If you have a storage account with a container that you want to use for this purpose, make a note of its resource group, storage account name, and container name, and proceed to [step 2](#step-2-configure-an-http-source).

To configure an Azure storage account, do the following:

1. Create a new storage account General-purpose v2 (GPv2) storage account. For instructions, see [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account?tabs=portal) in Azure help.
2. Create a container(Optional) all services in azure create containers automatically. This step is needed only when you are exporting custom logs in some container.
   * In the Azure portal, navigate to the storage account you just created (in the previous step).
   * Select **Blobs** under **Blob Service**.
      * Select **+ Container**,
      * Enter the Name
      * Select **Private** for the Public Access Level.
      * Click **OK**.

   Make a note of the container name. You will need to supply it later. By default, the flow logs are in `insights-logs-flowlogflowevent` container.
   If you have a storage account that you want to use for this purpose, make a note of its resource group, storage account name, then proceed to [step 2](#step-2-configure-an-http-source).

#### Step 2: Configure an HTTP Source

This section demonstrates how to configure an HTTP source to receive logs from the Azure function.

To configure an HTTP source for Azure, do the following:
1. Select a hosted collector where you want to configure the HTTP source. If desired, create a new hosted collector, as described on [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an HTTP source, as described on [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics). Make a note of the URL for the source, you will need it in the next step.
3. In **Advanced Options for Logs**, under **Timestamp Format**, click **Specify a format** and enter the following:
   * Specify Format as epoch
   * Specify Timestamp locator as `\"time\": (.*),`

#### Step 3: Configure Azure Resources using ARM template

To deploy the ARM template-based Blob Storage collection, refer to step 3 of [Collect Logs from Azure Blob Storage(block blobs)](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-blob-storage/block-blob/collect-logs#step-3-configure-azure-resources-using-arm-template). If you want to collect only flow logs from the storage account, you can add the filter `/blobServices/default/containers/insights-logs-flowlogflowevent/`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-virtual-network/networkflowlogs-template-deployment.png')} alt="Configure ARM Template for Azure Blob Storage(block blobs) collection" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

#### Step 4: Enable Virtual Network flow logs via the Azure Portal

Follow the steps detailed in the [Microsoft Azure Virtual Network documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-portal#create-a-flow-log) to enable the flow logs to point to the storage account you configured in the [Configure Azure Storage Account](#step-1-configure-azure-storage-account) section. You can select any target resources (available options are: Virtual network, Subnet, and Network interface) based on your requirements.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-virtual-network/virtualnetworkflowlogs.png')} alt="Configure Virtual Network Flow Logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

If you have multiple virtual networks, you can configure virtual network flow logs using a [built-in policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-policy#deploy-and-configure-virtual-network-flow-logs-using-a-built-in-policy) for each location and subscriptions.

#### Activity logs

To collect activity logs, follow the instructions [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/audit). Skip this step if you are already collecting activity logs for a subscription.

:::note
Since this source includes logs from multiple regions, avoid tagging it with a location tag.
:::

In order to find virtual networks without any flow log resource, you can audit flow logs configuration for virtual networks using a [built-in policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/vnet-flow-logs-policy#audit-flow-logs-configuration-for-virtual-networks-using-a-built-in-policy).
