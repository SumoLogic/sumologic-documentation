:::note
The information provided in this page will only support the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry app for Microsoft SQL Server for Windows.
:::
The SQL Server app is a unifies logs and metrics app to help you monitor the availability, performance, health, and resource utilization of your Microsoft SQL Server database clusters. Preconfigured dashboards provide insight into cluster status, performance, operations as well as backup and restore operations along with Performance metrics and metrics for transaction and transaction logs.

This app has been tested with following SQL Server versions:

- Microsoft SQL Server 2016

The diagram below illustrates the components of the SQL Server collection for each database server. OpenTelemetry collector runs on the same host as SQL Server, and uses the [SQL Server receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/sqlserverreceiver) to obtain SQL Server metrics. This receiver grabs metrics about a Microsoft SQL Server instance using the Windows Performance Counters. Because of this, it is a Windows only receiver. Thus metrics for SQL Server can be collected only if its in a windows machine.
SQL Server logs are sent to Sumo Logic through OpenTelemetry [filelog receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/filelogreceiver).

## Fields creation in Sumo Logic for SQL Server

Following are the [Fields](/docs/manage/fields/) which will be created as part of SQL Server App install if not already present.
* `db.cluster.name`. User configured. Enter a name to identify this SQL Server cluster. This cluster name will be shown in the Sumo Logic dashboards.
* `db.system`. Has a fixed value of **sqlserver**.
* `deployment.environment`. User configured. This is the deployment environment where the SQL Server cluster resides. For example dev, prod, or qa.
* `sumo.datasource`. Has a fixed value of **sqlserver**.

## Prerequisites

### For metrics collection

The [SQL server receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/receiver/sqlserverreceiver/README.md) for OpenTelemetry grabs metrics about a Microsoft SQL Server instance using the Windows Performance Counters. 

### For logs collection

Make sure logging is turned on in SQL Server. Follow [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/scm-services-configure-sql-server-error-logs?view=sql-server-ver15) to enable it.

The Microsoft SQL Server App's queries and dashboards depend on logs from the SQL Server ERRORLOG, which is typically found in: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL<version>.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG*`.

The ERRORLOG is typically in UTF-16LE encoding, however, be sure to verify the file encoding used in your SQL Server configuration.

**ACL Support**

For Windows systems, log files which are collected should be accessible by the SYSTEM group. Use the following set of PowerShell commands if the SYSTEM group does not have access.

```
$NewAcl = Get-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>"
# Set properties
$identity = "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
$fileSystemRights = "ReadAndExecute"
$type = "Allow"
# Create new rule
$fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList = $identity, $fileSystemRights, $type
$fileSystemAccessRule = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule -ArgumentList $fileSystemAccessRuleArgumentList
# Apply new rule
$NewAcl.SetAccessRule($fileSystemAccessRule)
Set-Acl -Path "<PATH_TO_LOG_FILE>" -AclObject $NewAcl
```

## Collection configuration and app installation

import ConfigAppInstall from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/config-app-install.md';

<ConfigAppInstall/>

### Step 1: Set up Collector

If you want to use an existing Otel Collector then this step can be skipped by selecting the option of using an existing Collector.

If you want to create a new Collector, select the **Add a new Collector** option.

Select the platform for which you want to install the Sumo OpenTelemetry Collector.

This will generate a command which can be executed in the machine which needs to get monitored. Once executed it will install the Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Collector agent.

### Step 2: Configure integration

The Microsoft SQL Server App's queries and dashboards depend on logs from the SQL Server ERRORLOG, which is typically found in:
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL<version>.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG*`

You can add any custom fields which you want to tag along with the data ingested in Sumo Logic. Click on the **Download YAML File** button to get the yaml file.

<img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/SQLServer-OpenTelemetry/SQL-Server-YAML.png' style={{border:'1px solid black'}} alt="YAML" />

### Step 3: Send logs to Sumo Logic

import LogsIntro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-intro.md';

<LogsIntro/>

<Tabs
  className="unique-tabs"
  defaultValue="Windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'Windows'},
    {label: 'Chef', value: 'Chef'},
    {label: 'Ansible', value: 'Ansible'},
    {label: 'Puppet', value: 'Puppet'},
  ]}>

<TabItem value="Windows">

1.  Copy the YAML file to `C:\ProgramData\Sumo Logic\OpenTelemetry Collector\config\conf.d` folder in the machine which needs to be monitored.
2.  Restart the collector using:
    ```sh
    Restart-Service -Name OtelcolSumo
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Chef">

import ChefNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/chef-without-env.md';

<ChefNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Ansible">

import AnsibleNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/ansible-without-env.md';

<AnsibleNoEnv/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Puppet">

import PuppetNoEnv from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/puppet-without-env.md';

<PuppetNoEnv/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import LogsOutro from '../../../reuse/apps/opentelemetry/send-logs-outro.md';

<LogsOutro/>

| if (isEmpty(_rawlog), _raw, _rawlog) as _raw
| parse regex "\s+(?<Logtype>Error|Warning):\s+(?<message>.*)$"
| count by LogType
```

## Sample Metrics Query

The following query is from the **SQL Server - Performance Counters** dashboard > **Page Buffer hit ratio %** panel:

```sql

```

## Viewing Microsoft SQL Server dashboards

### Overview

The **SQL Server - Overview** dashboard provides a snapshot overview of your SQL Server instance. Use this dashboard to understand CPU, Memory, and Disk utilization of your SQL Server(s) deployed in your cluster. This dashboard also provides information on login activities and methods by users.

Use this dashboard to:
- Keep track of Deadlock, Error, Backup failure, mirroring errors, and insufficient space issue counts.
- Examine Login activities, failures, and failure reasons.

### General Health

The **SQL Server - General Health** dashboard gives you the overall health of SQL Server. Use this dashboard to analyze server events including stopped/up servers, and corresponding down/uptime, monitor disk space percentage utilization, wait time trend, app-domain issues by SQL server.

Use this dashboard to:
- Analyze server events including stopped/up servers, and corresponding down/uptime.
- Monitor server events trends including SQL Server wait time.
- Get insight into app domain and percentage disk utilization issues by SQL Server.
