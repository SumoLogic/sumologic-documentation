The Azure Audit app allows you to collect data from the Azure Activity Log (formerly known as Azure Audit logs) and monitor the health of your Azure environment. This app provides preconfigured dashboards that allow you to monitor active directory activity, resource usage, service health, and user activity.

## Log type

The Azure Audit app uses the following log:

* [Azure Activity Log](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log?tabs=powershell)

## Collecting Logs for the Azure Audit app from Event Hub

In this step, you configure a pipeline for shipping logs from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) to an Event Hub. 

1. Sumo Logic supports several methods for collecting logs from Event Hub. You can choose any of them to collect logs.

    - [Azure Event Hubs Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/) (Recommended) 
    - Perform Steps 1 and Step 2 of [Collect Logs from Azure Monitor using Azure Functions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-logs-azure-monitor/#configure-log-collection) 
    
    When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/AzureActivity/Logs`.

2. Push logs from Azure Monitor to Event Hub.
    1. In the search bar, search, and select **Activity Log**.
    1. In the **Activity Log** window, click **Export Activity Logs**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/export-activity-log.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="activity-log" width="800"/>
    1. Select the log type in **Category details** that you want to ingest.
    1. Select the **Stream to an event hub** checkbox and then select the following:
        * **Subscription.** Pull-down, select a subscription.
        * **Event bub namespace.** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hubs Source) for collecting logs, select the **EventHubNamespace** created manually, or else if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select `SumoAzureLogsNamespace<UniqueSuffix>` namespace created by the ARM template.
        * **Event hub name (optional).** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hub Source) for collecting logs, select the event hub name, which you created manually, or if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select **insights-operational-logs**.
        * **Event hub policy name.** Leave the default policy, **RootManageSharedAccessKey**, or select another as desired.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/diagnostic-setting-audit.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="diagnostic-setting-audit.png" width="800"/>
    1. Click **Save.**

## Installing the Azure Audit app

Now that you have set up collection from the Azure Activity Log (previously known as Azure Audit logs), install the Azure Audit app to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

## Viewing Azure Audit Dashboards

The predefined Dashboards on Azure Audit allow you to instantly monitor the activities and events. All the dashboards in the app, except the Azure Audit - Active Directory dashboard, support logs from both Event Hub and Insight API.
