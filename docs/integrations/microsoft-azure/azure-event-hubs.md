With Sumo Logic's cloud-to-cloud Azure Event Hubs source capabilities, collecting and ingesting data from Azure Event Hubs becomes effortless. Azure Event Hubs is a modern big data streaming platform and event ingestion service, and this integration allows you to capture a wide range of data.

Once collected, Sumo Logic's robust analytics tools empower you to analyze the data effectively. You can detect and investigate a collection of operational and diagnostic information for Azure resources from resource logs, as well as gain insights about operations performed on Azure resources from activity logs.

By combining the power of Azure Event Hubs' monitoring endpoints with Sumo Logic's advanced analytics capabilities, you can significantly enhance your threat detection and response capabilities. This integration is designed to empower security teams, IT administrators, and decision-makers with the information they need to make informed choices and take proactive measures to effectively protect their systems and data.
