The IIS 10 (Legacy) App monitors the performance and reliability of your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) infrastructure, identifying customer-facing and internal operational issues. This app also provides the ability to monitor customer paths and interactions, so you can analyze how customers are using your product. The app provides predefined searches and Dashboards, that give visibility into your environment for real-time and historical analysis.


## Log Types  

IIS 10 (Legacy) App uses IIS version 10 logs. This section demonstrates how to enable logging from Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and HTTP Error Logs on your Windows server and ingest those logs into Sumo Logic.

IIS 10 App is backward compatible with IIS 8.5. IIS 10 App uses default log formats.
* IIS allows you to choose fields to log in IIS access logs. For explanations on the various fields and their significance see this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/w3c-logging).
* For information on how to configure HTTP Error Logs, and for explanations on the various HTTP Error Log fields and their significance see this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/820729/error-logging-in-http-apis).

This section covers the following default log formats for IIS 10 and IIS 8.5:
* [IIS Access Logs (W3C format)](#IIS-Access-Logs-W3C-format))
* [HTTP Error Logs](#HTTP-Error-Logs)
* [Performance Logs](#Performance-Logs)

IIS Log files are generated as local files. For a standard Windows Server, the default log location is as follows:
```bash
%SystemDrive%\inetpub\logs\LogFiles
```

For example:
```bash
c:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles\
```

Within the folder, you will find subfolders for each site configured with IIS. The logs are stored in folders that follow a naming pattern like W3SVC1, W3SVC2, W3SVC3, etc. The number at the end of the folder name corresponds to your site ID. For example, W3SVC2 is for site ID 2.

### Sample Log Messages  

This section provides samples of the following log message types:

* IIS Access Logs
* HTTP Error Logs
* IIS Performance Logs



#### IIS Access Logs (W3C default format)  

Sumo Logic expects logs in [W3C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/w3c-logging) format with following fields for our Field Extraction Rules and IIS 10 Application:

```
#Fields: date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip
cs(User-Agent) cs(Referrer) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
```

IIS allows you to choose fields to log in IIS access logs. For explanations on the various fields and their significance see this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/w3c-logging).

## Collecting Logs for the IIS 10 (Legacy) App

### Prerequisite tasks

The following tasks are required to prepare for logging IIS events:

* [Enable logging on your IIS server, if not already enabled](#Enable_logging_on_your_IIS_Server)
* [Verify log files are being created](#Verify_log_files_are_created)
* [Enable HTTP Error Logs on your Windows server](#Enable_HTTP_Error_Logs_on_your_Windows_Server)


#### Enable logging on your IIS Server

Perform the following task, if logging on your IIS Server is not already enabled.

To enable logging on your IIS Server, do the following:

1. Open IIS Manager.
2. Select the site or server in the **Connections** pane, and then double-click **Logging**.

Enhanced logging is only available for site-level logging. If you select the server in the Connections pane, then the Custom Fields section of the W3C Logging Fields dialog is disabled.

1. In the Format field under Log File, select **W3C** and then click Select Fields. IIS 10 App works on default fields selection.
2. Select following fields, if not already selected. Sumo Logic expects these fields in IIS logs for the IIS Application and Field Extraction Rule by default:

    ```
    date time s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port
    cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) cs(Referer) sc-status
    sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
    ```


For more information about IIS log format and log configuration refer [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-85/enhanced-logging-for-iis85).


#### Verify that log files are created

Perform the following task to ensure that log files are being created.

To confirm log files are being created, do the following:

1. Open a command-line window and change directories to C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles. This is the same path you will enter when you configure the Source to collect these files.
2. Under the \W3SVC1 directory, you should see one or more files with a .log extension. If the file is present, you can collect it.


#### Enable HTTP Error Logs on your Windows Server

Perform the following task to enable HTTP Error Logs on your Windows Server, that is hosting the IIS Server.

To enable HTTP Error Logs on the Windows Server hosting IIS Server, do the following:

1. To configure HTTP Error Logging, refer to this document [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/configuring-http-server-api-error-logging).
2. To understand HTTP Error Log format, refer to this document [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/http/format-of-the-http-server-api-error-logs).

HTTP Error Log files are generated as local files. The default HTTP Error log file location is:
```
C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR
```

### Configure a Collector

Sumo Logic recommends that you install the collector on the same system that hosts the logs.

To collect logs for the IIS 10 App, you will install a local Collector on the same server that hosts the logs.
* Follow the instructions for an [Installed Collector (Windows)](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows).


### Configure Sources

This section demonstrates how to configure sources for the following log types:

* [IIS Access Logs](#Configure_Source_for_IIS_Access_Logs)
* [HTTP Error Logs](#Configure_Source_for_HTTP_Error_Logs)
* [IIS Performance (Perfmon) Logs](#Configure_Source_for_IIS_Performance-Perfmom-Logs)


#### Configure Source for IIS Access Logs

This section demonstrates how to configure a Local File Source for IIS Access Logs, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/iis-10-legacy#configure-a-collector). You may configure a [Remote File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-file-source), but the configuration is more complex.

Sumo Logic recommends using a Local File Source whenever possible.

To configure a local file source for IIS Access Logs, do the following:

1. Configure a [Local File Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-file-source).
2. Specify Local File Source Fields as follows:
    1. **Name**: Required (for example, "IIS")
    2. **Description**. (Optional)
    3. **File Path **(Required).C:\inetpub\Logs\LogFiles\W3SVC*\*.log
    4. **Collection start time**. Choose how far back you would like to begin collecting historical logs. For example, choose 7 days ago to being collecting logs with a last modified date within the last seven days.
    5. **Source Host**. Sumo Logic uses the hostname assigned by the operating system by default, but you can enter a different host name.
    6. **Source Category** (Required). For example, "**Webserver/IIS/Access**". (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
3. Configure the **Advanced** section:
    7. **Timestamp Parsing Settings**: Make sure the setting matches the timezone on the log files.
    8. **Enable Timestamp Parsing**: Select **Extract timestamp information from log file entries**.
    9. **Time Zone**: Select the option to **Use time zone from log file. If none is present use:** and set the timezone to **UTC**.
    10. **Timestamp Format**: Select the option to **Automatically detect the format**.
    11. **Encoding**. UTF-8 is the default, but you can choose another encoding format from the menu if your IIS logs are encoded differently.
    12. **Enable Multiline Processing**. Uncheck the box to **Detect messages spanning multiple lines**. Since IIS Error logs are single line log files, disabling this option will ensure that your messages are collected correctly.
4. Click **Save**.

After a few minutes, your new Source should be propagated down to the Collector and will begin submitting your IIS log files to the Sumo Logic service.


#### Configure Source for HTTP Error Logs

This section demonstrates how to configure a Local File Source for HTTP Error Logs, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/iis-10-legacy#configure-a-collector).

4. Click **Save**.

After a few minutes, your new Source should be propagated down to the Collector and will begin submitting your IIS HTTP Error log files to the Sumo Logic service.


#### Configure Source for IIS Performance (Perfmon) Logs
This section demonstrates how to configure a Windows Performance Source, for use with an [Installed Collector](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/iis-10-legacy#Configure-a-Collector).


Sumo Logic recommends using a Local Windows Performance source whenever possible.

Use the appropriate source for your environment:

* [Local Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-performance-monitor-log-source)
* [Remote Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-performance-monitor-log-source)


To configure a Source for IIS Performance Logs, do the following:  

1. Configure a [Local Windows Performance Monitor Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-performance-monitor-log-source).
2. Configure the Local Windows Performance Source Fields as follows:
* **Name**: Required (for example, "IIS Performance")
* **Source Category** (Required). For example, **Webserver/IIS/PerfCounter**. (The Source Category metadata field is a fundamental building block to organize and label Sources. For details see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).)
* **Frequency: Every Minute **(you may custom choose frequency)
* **Description**. (Optional)
1. Under **Perfmon Queries** Click **Add Query**.
2. Add the following two queries:
* Query 1:
1. For** Name**, enter **WebServices**
2. For **Query**, enter select TotalMethodRequestsPerSec, GetRequestsPerSec, PostRequestsPerSec, CurrentConnections, CurrentAnonymousUsers, CurrentNonAnonymousUsers, CGIRequestsPerSec, ISAPIExtensionRequestsPerSec, BytesReceivedPerSec, BytesSentPerSec, FilesReceivedPerSec, FilesSentPerSec, ServiceUptime, BytesTotalPerSec from Win32_PerfFormattedData_W3SVC_WebService
* Query 2:
1. For** Name**, enter **HTTPServiceRequestQueues**
2. For **Query**, enter **Select ArrivalRate, CurrentQueueSize, CacheHitRate, RejectionRate, MaxQueueItemAge from Win32_PerfFormattedData_Counters_HTTPServiceRequestQueues**
1. Click** Save.**

## Installing the IIS 10 (Legacy) App

This section demonstrates how to install the IIS 10 (Legacy) App and provides examples and explanations for each of the app's predefined dashboards.

Now that you have set up collection for IIS 10, you are ready to install the Sumo Logic App for IIS 10 that provides preconfigured searches and dashboards that monitor events generated by IIS 10.

{@import ../../reuse/apps/app-install.md}

## Viewing IIS 10 (Legacy) Dashboards   

**Each dashboard has a set of filters** that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level.

**Each panel has a set of filters** that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.


### Overview Dashboard

The **IIS 10 - Overview Dashboard** provides a high-level view of the performance and integrity of your Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) infrastructure. Dashboard panels display visual graphs and detailed information on IIS versions, platforms, and log formats. Panels also show visitor geographic locations, top app requests. OS platforms, response status, response times, and client and server errors.

Use this dashboard to:
* Use this dashboard to get a high-level overview of sites, requests, client location, client platforms, error and threats identified.
* Drill Down to specific use cases by clicking on specific panels of interest.

<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/IIS_10/IIS10_Overview.png')} alt="Overview Dashboard" />


### HTTP Error Dashboard

The **IIS 10 - HTTP Error Dashboard** provides detailed information on IIS error logging in HTTP. Dashboard panels show details on error events, top client and server IP addresses, top protocol versions and protocol status. Panels also show information on top reason phrases and verbs associated with HTTP errors, as well as top request details by reason.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor errors logged by HTTP.SYS. The client request may be rejected by HTTP.SYS before it made it to an IIS worker process. In such cases the error is logged in the HTTPERR logs.
* Identify the reason for failure. Check if the request violated the HTTP protocol, or if there was a WAS/the application pool failure.
* Correct the error identified to ensure a consistent and satisfactory user experience.

<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/IIS_10/IIS10_HTTPERR.png')} alt="HTTP Error Dashboard" />


### Performance Snapshot Dashboard

The **IIS 10 - Performance Snapshot Dashboard** provides detailed information on your IIS infrastructure integrity and performance. Dashboard panels show details on Web Service uptime, active connections, requests, user activity, and total bytes transferred. Panels also provide HTTP Service Request Queues details, such as arrivals, queue size, cache hit rate, and rejection rate.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor incoming request traffic, along with queue size and rejection rate to identify any bottlenecks.
* Monitor cache hit rates to check how requests are being served. Typically static content has high cache hit rates.
* Monitor current active connections to track sudden rises in connections. A sudden rise results in increased resource requirements. A sudden rise may also indicate security attack.
* Monitor the load on your site by looking into the rate of all the requests and rates based on specific types of HTTP methods, to anticipate resource needs and allocate them accordingly.
* Monitor Bytes/Files transferred, to check if there is a need to make page content more lightweight, or track the most typically transferred high data content. This can also be an indicator of a potential spike in traffic.

<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/IIS_10/IIS10_Performance.png')} alt="Performance Snapshot Dashboard" />


### Performance Trends Dashboard

The **IIS 10 - Performance Trends Dashboard** provides details on ISS infrastructure trends for requests, active connections, bytes received and sent, files received and sent, queue size, arrival rate, and cache hit rate.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor trends of various metrics to keep track of how requests are served over time and anticipate potential performance bottlenecks.
* Acquire current performance snapshots of IIS servers. You can drill down to the Performance Snapshot by clicking the Requests Per Sec (All methods) panel.

<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/IIS_10/IIS10_Performance_Trends.png')} alt="Performance Trends Dashboard" />


### Threat Analysis Dashboard

The **IIS 10 - Threat Analysis Dashboard** provides high-level views of threats throughout your IIS network. Dashboard panels display visual graphs and detailed information on Threats by Client IP, Threats by Referrer, and Threats by URL.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify potential threats and indicators of compromise.
* Monitor if your site is access through:
    * bad Client IP
    * referred by bad referrer
    * your own webpage is page is tagged as malicious by CrowdStrike
