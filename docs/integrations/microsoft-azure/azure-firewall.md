[Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/overview) is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. It's a fully stateful, firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. This integration helps in monitoring firewall health, network rules, application rules, threat intelligence, and IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) events.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Firewall, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Azure Firewall Application Rule**. Contains all Application rule log data. Each match between data plane and Application rule creates a log entry with the data plane packet and the matched rule's attributes.
* **Azure Firewall Network Rule Aggregation (Policy Analytics)**. Contains aggregated Application rule log data for Policy Analytics.
* **Azure Firewall DNS Flow Trace Log**. Contains all the DNS proxy data between the client, firewall, and DNS server.
* **Azure Firewall DNS query**. Contains all DNS Proxy events log data.
* **Azure Firewall Fat Flow Log**. This query returns the top flows across Azure Firewall instances. Log contains flow information, date transmission rate (in Megabits per second units) and the time period when the flows were recorded. Please follow the documentation to enable Top flow logging and details on how it is recorded.
* **Azure Firewall Flow Trace Log**. Flow logs across Azure Firewall instances. Log contains flow information, flags and the time period when the flows were recorded. Please follow the documentation to enable flow trace logging and details on how it is recorded.
* **Azure Firewall FQDN Resolution Failure**. Contains all internal Firewall FQDN resolution requests that resulted in failure.
* **Azure Firewall IDPS Signature**. Contains all data plane packets that were matched with one or more IDPS signatures.
* **Azure Firewall Nat Rule**. Contains all DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation) events log data. Each match between data plane and DNAT rule creates a log entry with the data plane packet and the matched rule's attributes.
* **Azure Firewall Nat Rule Aggregation (Policy Analytics)**. Azure Firewall Nat Rule Aggregation (Policy Analytics).
* **Azure Firewall Network Rule**. Contains all Network Rule log data. Each match between data plane and network rule creates a log entry with the data plane packet and the matched rule's attributes.
* **Azure Firewall Application Rule Aggregation (Policy Analytics)**. Contains aggregated Network rule log data for Policy Analytics.
* **Azure Firewall Threat Intelligence**. Contains all Threat Intelligence events.

For more information on supported metrics and logs schema, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall/monitor-firewall-reference).

* **Azure Firewall Metrics**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.Network/azureFirewalls](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-network-azurefirewalls-metrics) namespace.

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Firewall you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/Firewall/Logs` and `Azure/Firewall/Metrics`.

### Configure collector

Create a hosted collector if not already configured and tag the `tenant_name` field. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name). Make sure you create the required sources in this collector. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Configure metrics collection

import MetricsSource from '../../reuse/metrics-source.md';

<MetricsSource/>

### Configure logs collection

#### Diagnostic logs

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.

1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to the [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
2. To create the diagnostic settings in the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/data-factory/monitor-configure-diagnostics). Perform the steps below for each Azure Firewall that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose **Stream to an event hub** as the destination.
   1. Select the log categories you want to collect
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.
   <img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azure-firewall-diagnostic-settings.png')} alt="Azure Firewall diagnostic settings" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
3. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Firewall Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

#### Activity logs (optional)

import ActivityLogs from '../../reuse/apps/azure-activity-logs.md';

<ActivityLogs/>

## Installing the Azure Firewall app

Now that you have set up data collection, install the Azure Firewall Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstallIndexV2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-index-option.md';

<AppInstallIndexV2/>

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region to which the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, azureFirewalls).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, firewall name).
- `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with a Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource.
