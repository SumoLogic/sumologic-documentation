[Azure App Service Plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) defines a set of compute resources for a app service to run. This integration helps in monitoring memory, CPU, incoming and outgoing bandwidth, number of sockets and their states across all the instances of the plan.

## Log and metric types

For Azure App Service Plan, you can collect the following metrics:

- **Activity logs**, provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in the Azure. To learn more, refer to [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema).

- **Platform Metrics for Azure App Service Plan**. These metrics are available in the [Microsoft.Web/serverfarms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-web-serverfarms-metrics) namespace. For more information on supported metrics, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-monitor#understand-metrics). App Service Plan metrics are available only for plans in Basic, Standard, Premium and Isolated tiers.

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure App Service plan you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same event hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/AppServicePlan/Logs`, `Azure/AppServicePlan/Metrics`.

###  Configure collector

Create a hosted collector if not already configured and tag the `tenant_name` field. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name). Make sure you create the required sources in this collector. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Configure metrics collection

import MetricsSource from '../../reuse/metrics-source.md';

<MetricsSource/>

#### Activity logs (optional)

import ActivityLogs from '../../reuse/apps/azure-activity-logs.md';

## Installing the Azure App Service Plan app

This section provides instructions on how to install the Azure App Service Plan app, and shows examples of each of the preconfigured dashboards you can use to analyze your data.

import AppInstallIndexV2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-index-option.md';

<AppInstallIndexV2/>

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
- `service_type`. Type of the service that can be accessed with an Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances the service is Subscriptions).
