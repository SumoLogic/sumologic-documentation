[Azure Service Bus](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview) is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics (in a namespace) used for decoupling applications and services from each other. This integration helps in monitoring incoming/outgoing messages, connections, throttled requests, and resource usage of your Service Bus namespace.

## Log and metric types

For Azure Service Bus, you can collect the following logs and metrics:

* **Operational Logs**. To learn more about the resource log schema for Azure Service Bus, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/monitor-service-bus-reference#resource-logs).
* **VNet And IP Filtering Logs**. To learn more about the resource log schema for Azure Service Bus, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/monitor-service-bus-reference#resource-logs).
* **Runtime Audit Logs**. To learn more about the resource log schema for Azure Service Bus, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/monitor-service-bus-reference#runtime-audit-logs).
* **Diagnostic Error Logs**. To learn more about the resource log schema for Azure Service Bus, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/monitor-service-bus-reference#diagnostic-error-logs).
* **Platform Metrics for Azure Service Bus**. These metrics are available in [Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/reference/supported-metrics/microsoft-servicebus-namespaces-metrics) namespace. For more information on supported metrics and dimensions, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/monitor-service-bus-reference#metrics).

## Setup

Azure service sends monitoring data to Azure Monitor, which can then [stream data to Eventhub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs). Sumo Logic supports:

* Logs collection from [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) using our [Azure Event Hubs source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
* Metrics collection using our [Azure Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/microsoft-source/azure-metrics-source).

You must explicitly enable diagnostic settings for each Azure Service Bus namespace you want to monitor. You can forward logs to the same Event Hub provided they satisfy the limitations and permissions as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#destination-limitations).

When you configure the Event Hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/ServiceBus/Logs`, `Azure/ServiceBus/Metrics`.

###  Configure collector

Create a hosted collector if not already configured and tag the `tenant_name` field. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name). Make sure you create the required sources in this collector. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Tenant-Name.png')} alt="Azure Tag Tenant Name" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Configure metrics collection

import MetricsSource from '../../reuse/metrics-source.md';

<MetricsSource/>

### Configure logs collection

In this section, you will configure a pipeline for shipping diagnostic logs from Azure Monitor to an Event Hub.
#### Diagnostic logs
1. To set up the Azure Event Hubs source in Sumo Logic, refer to [Azure Event Hubs Source for Logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).
1. To create the Diagnostic settings in the Azure portal, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=portal#create-diagnostic-settings). Perform the steps below for each Azure Service Bus namespace that you want to monitor.
   1. Choose `Stream to an event hub` as the destination.
   1. Select `allLogs`.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.
   1. Use the Event Hub namespace and Event Hub name configured in the previous step in the destination details section. You can use the default policy `RootManageSharedAccessKey` as the policy name.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/azure-servicebus-logs.png')} alt="Azure Service Bus logs" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Tag the location field in the source with the right location value. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Azure-Storage-Tag-Location.png')} alt="Azure Service Bus Tag Location" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

#### Activity logs (optional)

import ActivityLogs from '../../reuse/apps/azure-activity-logs.md';

<ActivityLogs/>

## Installing the Azure Service Bus app

Now that you have set up data collection, install the Azure Service Bus Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured [dashboards](#viewing-the-azure-service-bus-dashboards) that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstallIndexV2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-index-option.md';

<AppInstallIndexV2/>

As part of the app installation process, the following fields will be created by default:

- `tenant_name`. This field is tagged at the collector level. You can get the tenant name using the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tenant-management-read-tenant-name#get-your-tenant-name).
- `location`. The region the resource name belongs to.
- `subscription_id`. ID associated with a subscription where the resource is present.
- `resource_group`. The resource group name where the Azure resource is present.
- `provider_name`. Azure resource provider name (for example, Microsoft.Network).
- `resource_type`. Azure resource type (for example, storage accounts).
- `resource_name`. The name of the resource (for example, storage account name).
- `service_type`. The type of service that can be accessed with an Azure resource.
- `service_name`. Services that can be accessed with an Azure resource (for example, in Azure Container Instances, the service is Subscriptions).
