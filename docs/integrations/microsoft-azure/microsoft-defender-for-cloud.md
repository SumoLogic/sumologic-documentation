The Sumo Logic app for Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a powerful solution designed to provide Azure cloud security analysts with actionable insights into their cloud security posture. By integrating with Microsoft Defender for Cloud, this app delivers advanced monitoring, alerting, and compliance tracking capabilities through purpose-built dashboards tailored to meet the needs of security teams.

Key features of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud app include:

- Gain real-time visibility into security alerts across your Azure environment, categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low, and Informational).
- Monitor trends in alert activity over time to identify spikes and recurring threats.
- Geolocate alerts to identify suspicious activities from embargoed or high-risk regions.
- Leverage detailed alert summaries and remediation steps for effective threat mitigation.
- Address vulnerabilities proactively by monitoring security recommendations grouped by risk levels (High, Medium, and Low).
- Visualize trends in recommendation volumes and focus on affected resources, such as Virtual Machines, Apps, and Containers.
- Analyze threats by categories like data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and account breaches.
- Follow step-by-step remediation plans to resolve high-priority risks and strengthen your overall security posture.
- Track compliance performance across critical standards, including FedRAMP, PCI DSS 4, CIS Azure Foundations, and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark.
- Understand pass, fail, and skip rates for specific compliance controls.
- Identify areas requiring immediate action to ensure regulatory adherence for your Azure resources.

## Log types

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud app uses the following logs:

* [Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/managing-and-responding-alerts)
* [Security recommendations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/review-security-recommendations)
* [Regulatory compliance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-regulatory-compliance-standards)

## Collection configuration

To forward Microsoft Defender events to Sumo Logic, you can set up an efficient pipeline: **Microsoft Defender** > **Event Hub** > **Sumo Logic (Hosted Collector)**. This setup ensures that security events from Microsoft Defender are seamlessly ingested into Sumo Logic for monitoring and analysis.

1. **[Create a Sumo Logic Azure Event Hub Source](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/)**. Configure an Event Hub source to receive events from the Azure platform. This will act as the endpoint for the data pipeline.
1. **[Set up continuous export in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/continuous-export)**. Within the Azure portal, configure the Microsoft Defender for Cloud to export its security events to the Event Hub instance created in the previous step. Continuous export ensures that the events such as alerts, recommendations, and regulatory compliance updates are forwarded in near real-time as shown below.

## Troubleshooting

### Verify Event Hub data flow

If your configured Event Hub instance is not successfully sending data to Sumo Logic. Follow the below steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Navigate to the **Event Hub Instance Blade** in the Azure portal and select the **Data Explorer (preview)** tab to send sample events.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/event-hub-instance-blade.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="event-hub-instance-blade" width="800"/>
1. In the **Data Explorer (preview)** page, click **Send event** and preview the sample events.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/data-explorer.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="data-explorer" width="800"/>
1. Verify if those events are being sent to the [Sumo Logic by Live Tailing](/docs/search/live-tail/about-live-tail/). If the data matches, then the Event Hub instance will successfully send data to Sumo Logic. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/live-tailing.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="live-tailing" width="800"/>

### Validate alerts at Event Hub

If you are not receiving any alerts from the Microsoft Defender to the Event Hub instance, first make sure that the generated sample alerts are received in your configured Event Hub instance. This ensures the connection between Defender and Event Hub is functioning correctly. To test the pipeline by sending sample alerts from Microsoft Defender, follow the below steps:

1. In the **Microsoft Defender** console, select **Security Alerts** under **General** section.
1. In the **Security Alerts** page, select the **Sample Alerts** tab.
1. Click on **Create sample alerts** to receive the sample alerts. This validates that the sample alerts are forwarded to the configured Event Hub instance.
