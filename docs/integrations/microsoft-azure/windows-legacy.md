The Windows Legacy App provides insight into your Windows system's operation and events so that you can better manage and maintain your environment. The Windows Legacy App consists of predefined searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage of Security Status, System Activity, Updates, and User Activity.

## Log types

The Windows Legacy App assumes events are coming from Remote Windows Event Log Sources. It does not work with third party logs. Standard Windows event channels include:
* Security
* Application
* System

Custom event channels, such as PowerShell or Internet Explorer are also supported.


### Sample log messages


```bash
instance of Win32_NTLogEvent
{
    Category = 13571;
    CategoryString = "MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change";
    ComputerName = "aphrodite.sumolab.org";
    EventCode = 4957;
    EventIdentifier = 4957;
    EventType = 5;
    InsertionStrings = {"CoreNet-IPHTTPS-In", "Core Networking - IPHTTPS (TCP-In)", "Local Port"};
    Logfile = "Security";
    Message = "Windows Firewall did not apply the following rule:

    Rule Information:
    ID: CoreNet-IPHTTPS-In
    Name: Core Networking - IPHTTPS (TCP-In)

    Error Information:
    Reason: Local Port resolved to an empty set.";
    RecordNumber = 1441653878;
    SourceName = "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing";
    TimeGenerated = "20130411232352.140400-000";
    TimeWritten = "20130411232352.140400-000";
    Type = "Audit Failure";
};
```

### Sample queries

```sql title="Recent Policy Changes"
_sourceCategory=OS/Windows "Policy Change"
| parse regex "CategoryString = \"(?<category>[^\"]+?)\";[\s\S]+?Logfile = \"Security\""
| count by category
| where category matches "*Policy Change*"
```


## Collecting Logs for Windows Legacy

This section provides instructions on configuring log collection for the Windows Legacy App, so that logs are collected from the Microsoft Windows Event Log and ingested into Sumo Logic. A sample log message and example query are also provided.

[Windows Performance](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/performance) is considered a separate data type.


### Configure a Collector and a Source

To configure a collector and source, do the following:

1. Configure an [Installed Windows collector](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/windows) through the user interface or from the command line.
2. Configure either a local or remote Windows Event Log source. To configure a Windows Event Log source, set **Event Format** to **Collect using legacy format**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/microsoft-azure/Event_Format_Legacy.png')} alt="Event_Format_Legacy" />

Events retain their default text format from Windows.

For more information on local or remote Windows Event Log Source configuration, refer to [Local Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/local-windows-event-log-source) and [Remote Windows Event Log Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/remote-windows-event-log-source).


## Installing the Windows Legacy App

Now that you have configured Windows logs, install the Sumo Logic App for Windows Legacy to take advantage of the pre-configured searches and dashboards to analyze your Windows data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

### Event Errors

See information about Window event messages that contain a keyword that indicates a problem. (If a Windows event contains  "error", "timeout", "exception", or "fail", Sumo tags the message with "error_keyword", "timeout_keyword", "exception_keyword", or "fail_keyword" respectively.)

<img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Windows/EventErrors.png')} alt="Event Errors" />

**Error Keyword - Outlier**. See timeslices where the count of problem keywords exceeds the moving average by a statistically significant amount, three standard deviations over the last 24 hours.

**Error Keyword - LogReduce**. See a LogReduce analysis of event messages that contain problem keywords. (Sumo's LogReduce algorithm uses fuzzy logic to cluster messages together based on string and pattern similarity. For more information, see, [Detect Patterns with LogReduce](/docs/search/logreduce/detect-patterns-with-logreduce)).
