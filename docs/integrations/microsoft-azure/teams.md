The Microsoft Teams app provides out-of-the-box dashboards to monitor users, teams, channels and permission changes.

## Installing the Microsoft Teams App   

This section has instructions for installing the Microsoft Teams app and descriptions of each of the app dashboards.

This section shows you how to install the Sumo Logic App for Microsoft Teams.

To install the app, do the following:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.

Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library.](/docs/get-started/library/install-apps)

3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`). 
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
