Azure Active Directory is a cloud-based directory and identity management service that provides directory services, application access management, and identity protection. The Sumo Logic App for Azure helps you monitor activity in the Azure Active Directory. The dashboards provide insight into role management, user management, group management, successful and failed sign-in events, directory management, and application management data that helps you understand your users' experience.

## Log Types

The app uses the following log types:

* [Audit and Sign-in logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reporting-azure-monitor-diagnostics-overview#supported-reports)

Only global administrators, security administrators, security readers, and report readers can view sign-ins and enable collection for Sign-in Events.

The Sumo Logic App for Azure Active Directory presents information about activity in Azure Active Directory, including role management, user management, group management, directory management, and application management.


## Collect Logs for the Azure Active Directory App

Instructions for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic App for Azure Active Directory.

This section has instructions for setting up the ingestion pipeline from Azure Active Directory to Sumo Logic.

The sections below are either for FedRamp Sumo Logic deployments or if you have been advised by the Sumo Logic support team to not use the Cloud to Cloud Integration based on your Azure environments.

* Azure Monitor collects logs for Azure Active Directory and streams the data to an Azure Event Hub.
* Event Hub streams the logs collected by Azure Monitor to an Azure function.
* The Azure function is a small piece of code that is triggered by Event Hub to send Azure Active Directory logs to the Sumo HTTP Source. The function also logs to one Storage Account and logs failover data to another.


### Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription must be associated (attached) to AAD. For more information, see this [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).
* To export Azure Activity logs to reports, be sure you have met the [Azure Active Directory requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-activity-logs-azure-monitor).


### Configure an HTTP Source

In this step, you configure an HTTP Source to receive logs from the Azure function.

1. Select a Hosted Collector where you want to configure the HTTP Source. If desired, create a new Hosted Collector, as described on [Configure a Hosted Collector](https://htmlcodeeditor.com/03Send-Data/Hosted-Collectors/Configure-a-Hosted-Collector/).
2. Configure an HTTP source, as described on [HTTP Logs and Metrics Source](https://htmlcodeeditor.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source/).


### Configure Azure resources using ARM template


```

```



### Troubleshooting log collection

If logs are not flowing into Sumo Logic, follow the steps in Troubleshooting log collection in the following [document](https://htmlcodeeditor.com/03Send-Data/Collect-from-Other-Data-Sources/Azure_Monitoring/Collect_Logs_from_Azure_Monitor/).



## Install the Azure Active Directory App

Now that you have set up collection for the Azure Active Directory, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

**To install the app:**

{@import ../../reuse/apps/app-install.md}
