Azure Active Directory is a cloud-based directory and identity management service that provides directory services, application access management, and identity protection. The Sumo Logic app for Azure helps you to monitor activity in the Azure Active Directory. These dashboards provide insight into role management, user management, group management, successful and failed sign-in events, directory management, and application management data that helps you understand your users' experience.

## Log types

The app uses the following log types:

* [Audit and Sign-in logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reporting-azure-monitor-diagnostics-overview#supported-reports)

Only global administrators, security administrators, security readers, and report readers can view sign-ins and enable collection for Sign-in Events.

The Sumo Logic app for Azure Active Directory presents information about activity in Azure Active Directory, including role management, user management, group management, directory management, and application management.

## Collect Logs for the Azure Active Directory app

Sumo Logic supports several methods for collecting logs from Event Hub. You can choose any of them to collect logs.

- [Azure Event Hubs Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/azure-event-hubs-source/) (Recommended) 
- Perform Steps 1 and Step 2 of [Collect Logs from Azure Monitor using Azure Functions](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/collect-logs-azure-monitor/#configure-log-collection)

When you configure the event hubs source or HTTP source, plan your source category to ease the querying process. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards. For example: `Azure/AAD/Logs`.

### Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription must be associated (attached) to AAD. For more information, see this [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory).
* To export Azure Activity logs to reports, be sure you have met the [Azure Active Directory requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-activity-logs-azure-monitor).


### Export Azure Active Directory logs to Event Hub

In this task, you export logs for your Azure Active Directory app. For related information see [Send Logs to Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-log-analytics#send-logs-to-azure-monitor) in the Azure help documentation.

While exporting logs for an Azure Active Directory app, do the following:
* **Event hub namespace.** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hubs Source) for collecting logs, select the **EventHubNamespace** created manually, or else if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select `SumoAzureLogsNamespace<UniqueSuffix>` namespace created by the ARM template.
* **Event hub name (optional).** If you have chosen Method 1 (Azure Event Hub Source) for collecting logs, select the event hub name, which you created manually, or if you have chosen Method 2 (Collect logs from Azure monitor using Azure functions), then select **insights-operational-logs**.

## Install the Azure Active Directory app

Now that you have set up collection for the Azure Active Directory, install the Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
