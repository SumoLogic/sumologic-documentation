Auth0 is a cloud-based, extensible identity provider for applications. The Sumo Logic App for Auth0 makes it easy to analyze and visualize your Auth0 event logs, and provides insight into security and operational issues.

For more information, see [Export Logs to Sumo Logic](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/sumologic).


## Collecting Logs for Auth0
This procedure explains how to collect error logs from Auth0.

Sumo Logic collects the following log types:
* Logins, both successes and failures
* Token exchanges, both successes and failures
* Warnings during logins
* User deletion
* Login failure reasons
* Connection errors
* User signup events
* Verification email events
* Password changes
* Rate limiting events
* Other operational events and errors

For more information about Auth0 logs, see [https://auth0.com/docs/api/managemen.../Logs/get_logs](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Logs/get_logs)


### Prerequisites

Use the Auth0 Management Portal to configure the extension. For more information, see [https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/sumologic](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/sumologic).


### Configure a Collector

Use the in-product [setup wizard](/docs/send-data/setup-wizard) in the Sumo Logic UI to configure a **Custom App**.


### Configure a Source

Source type is [HTTP](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).

* **Name**: Required
* **Category**:
* **Timestamp Parsing Settings**:
  * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**: True
  * **Timezone**: Logs are sent in UTC by default and can be automatically detected
  * **Timestamp Format**: Select **Specify a format** and use the following, \
Format: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z' \
`Timestamp locator: `"date":"(.*?)\","`
* **Multi-line Parsing Settings**:
  * **Detect Messages Spanning Multiple Lines**: True
  * **Multi Line Boundary**: Infer Boundaries


### Use Field Extraction Rules

Parse Expression: `json "date", "type", "client_id", "client_name", "ip", "user_id"`


## Sample log messages

```json title="Example 1"
{
   "date": "2016-02-23T19:57:29.532Z",
   "type": "sapi",
   "client_id": "AaiyAPdpYdesoKnqjj8HJqRn4T5titww",
   "client_name": "My application Name",
   "ip": "190.257.209.19",
   "location_info": {},
   "details": {},
   "user_id": "auth0|56c75c4e42b6359e98374bc2"
}
```


```json title="Example 2"
{
   "date": "2016-11-14T21:50:33.473Z",
   "type": "fp",
   "description": "Wrong email or password.",
   "connection": "Username-Password-Authentication",

      }
   },
   "user_id": "auth0|123ASD987",
   "user_name": "no-one@sumologic.com",
   "strategy": "auth0",
   "strategy_type": "database",
   "_id": "321654987654321654987654321",
   "isMobile": false
}
```



## Sample queries

```sql title="Logins by Client per Day"
_collector="productionappauth0Logs_Collector"
| json "client_name"
| where client_name != ""
| timeslice by 1d
| count by _timeslice, client_name
| transpose row _timeslice column client_name
```

```sql title="Client Version Usage"
_collector="productionappauth0Logs_Collector"
| json "auth0_client.name", "auth0_client.version"
| concat(%auth0_client.name, " ", %auth0_client.version) as auth0_client_version
| timeslice 1h
| count by _timeslice, auth0_client_version
| transpose row _timeslice column auth0_client_version
```

```sql title="Top 10 Recent Errors"
_collector="productionappauth0Logs_Collector"
| json "type", "connection", "description", "client_name"
| where type != "slo"
| count client_name, connection, description
| top 10 client_name, connection, description by _count
```


## Installing the Auth0 App

Now that you have set up collection for Auth0, install the Sumo Logic App for Auth0 to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
