OneLogin is an Identity Management provider that supplies a comprehensive set of enterprise-grade identity and access management solutions, including single sign-on (SSO), user provisioning, and multi-factor authentication. The Sumo Logic App for OneLogin provides real-time visibility and analysis of OneLogin user activity through event data, such as user logins, administrative operations, and provisioning.


## Prerequisites

:::note
To use this feature, you'll need to enable access to your OneLogin logs and ingest them into Sumo Logic.
:::

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page in Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.

* **OneLogin Enterprise** or **Unlimited **plan subscription.
* **Configure an Event Broadcaster**
   * Add a Sumo Logic [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) to your Sumo Logic Org.
   * Configure an [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) for your OneLogin data. Make sure to set the **Source Category** when configuring the OneLogin source. For example, onelogin.
   * From OneLogin, configure a broadcaster that points to this endpoint using the instructions in the [OneLogin documentation](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=43f95543db109700d5505eea4b961959). You must use SIEM (NDJSON) format. Use the Sumo Logic HTTP Source URL as the Listener URL, and custom header is not needed.


## Log Types and Sample Log Message

The Sumo Logic App for OneLogin uses event logs in NDJSON format. Each event is a single-line JSON, containing information such as:

```json
{
	"event":{
		"create":{
			"_id":"443ce874-7704-54d2-b12f-b6e4a72ec6ef"

## Sample Query


```sql title="Name - Events by User"
_sourceCategory=onelogin
| json "event.event_type_id", "event.app_name","event.ipaddr", "event.user_name", "event.actor_user_name" as event_id, app_name, src_ip, user_name, actor_user_name  
| where event_id in ("10","11")
| count by user_name
| sort by _count
```


## Installing the OneLogin App

Now that you have set up collection for OneLogin, install the Sumo Logic App for OneLogin to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards that provide insight into your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
