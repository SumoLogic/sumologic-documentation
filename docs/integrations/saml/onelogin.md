OneLogin is an Identity Management provider that supplies a comprehensive set of enterprise-grade identity and access management solutions, including single sign-on (SSO), user provisioning, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). The Sumo Logic app for OneLogin provides real-time visibility and analysis of OneLogin user activity through event data, such as user logins, administrative operations, and provisioning.

The app provides insights into account activity and user behavior, including total and invited users, inactive or never-logged-in accounts, user status, failed login attempts, lockouts, and password reset needs, helping administrators monitor user lifecycles and maintain security.

:::info
This app includes [built-in monitors](#onelogin-alerts). For details on creating custom monitors, refer to [Create monitors for OneLogin app](#create-monitors-for-onelogin-app).
:::

## Setting up the collection

**Prerequisites**

:::note
To use this feature, you'll need to enable access to your OneLogin logs and ingest them into Sumo Logic.
:::

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page in Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-account/upgrade-cloud-flex-legacy-account) at any time.

### Configure an event broadcaster for event logs

* Add a Sumo Logic [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) to your Sumo Logic Org.
* Configure an [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) for your OneLogin data. Make sure to set the **Source Category** when configuring the OneLogin source. For example, `onelogin`.
* From OneLogin, configure a broadcaster that points to this endpoint using the instructions in the [OneLogin documentation](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=43f95543db109700d5505eea4b961959). You must use SIEM (NDJSON) format. Use the Sumo Logic HTTP Source URL as the Listener URL, and custom header is not needed.

### Configure the C2C source for users' logs

Follow the instructions for setting up [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for OneLogin App](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/onelogin-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic app for OneLogin uses the following logs:
- Event logs in NDJSON format.
- Sumo Logicâ€™s [OneLogin Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/onelogin-source/) to collect [Users' Logs](https://developers.onelogin.com/api-docs/2/users/user-resource) from OneLogin platform.
