AWS AppSync enables developers to connect their applications and services to data and events with secure, serverless and high-performing GraphQL and Pub/Sub APIs. For more details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/what-is-appsync.html).

## Log and metric types

* [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/monitoring.html#cw-metrics)
* [CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/monitoring.html#cwl)
* [CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/cloudtrail-logging.html)

## Setup

You can collect the logs and metrics for Sumo Logic's AWS AppSync integration by following the below steps.

### Configure metrics collection

* Collect **CloudWatch Metrics** with namespace `AWS/AppSync` using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source/) source. For `AWS/AppSync` metrics and dimensions, refer to [AWS AppSync CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/monitoring.html#cw-metrics).

### Configure logs collection

* Collect **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source/) source. You can configure request-level and field-level types of logging on any new or existing GraphQL API. For more information, refer to [AWS AppSync CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/monitoring.html#cwl). 
* Collect [AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/cloudtrail-logging.html) using the [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source/) source. AWS AppSync is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in AWS AppSync. CloudTrail captures all API calls for AWS AppSync as events, which includes calls from the AWS AppSync console and from code calls to the AWS AppSync APIs. You can use the information collected by CloudTrail to determine the request that was made to AWS AppSync, the IP address of the requester, who made the request, when the request was made, and additional details. You can create a trail to enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, including events for AWS AppSync.
