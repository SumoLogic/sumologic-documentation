Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance. For more details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html).

## Log and Metric types

* [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html)
* [Access Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html)
* [Real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html)
* CloudWatch Logs
  * [Edge Function Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-functions-logs.html)
* [CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging_using_cloudtrail.html)

## Setup

You can collect the logs and metrics for Sumo Logic's Amazon CloudFront integration by following the below steps.

### Configure metrics collection

* Collect **CloudWatch Metrics** with namespace [AWS/CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html) using [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source/) source. For `AWS/CloudFront` metrics and dimensions, refer to [Amazon CloudFront CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/programming-cloudwatch-metrics.html).

### Configure logs collection

* Collect **Access Logs** using the [Amazon S3](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-source/) source. You can configure CloudFront to create log files that contain detailed information about every user request that CloudFront receives. These are called standard logs, also known as [access logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html). If you enable standard logs, you can also specify the Amazon S3 bucket that you want CloudFront to save files. 
* Collect **real-time Logs** using the [Amazon S3](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-source/) source if you have real-time logs destination set to S3 bucket. With CloudFront [real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html), you can get information about requests made to distribution in real-time (logs are delivered within seconds of receiving the requests). You can use real-time logs to monitor, analyze, and take action based on content delivery performance.
* Collect **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source/) source. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to get logs for your [edge functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-functions-logs.html), both Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions.
* Collect [AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging_using_cloudtrail.html) using the [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source/) source. Amazon CloudFront is integrated with CloudTrail, an AWS service that captures information about every request sent to the CloudFront API by your AWS account, including your IAM users. CloudTrail periodically saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail captures information about all requests, whether they were made using the CloudFront console, the CloudFront API, the AWS SDKs, the CloudFront CLI, or another service, for example, AWS CloudFormation.
