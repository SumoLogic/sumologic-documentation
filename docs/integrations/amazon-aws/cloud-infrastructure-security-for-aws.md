:::info
**Preview**<br/>The Cloud Security Infrastructure for AWS solution is in a preview release, and has the following limitations:
* The CloudFormation template only supports one AWS region (with multiple AWS accounts) during preview. You are encouraged to get started with one AWS region. 
* E-mail notifications for installation errors are not enabled.
* After initial installation, data collection may be delayed.
* If you have already installed the [Amazon Security Quickstart](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/security-quickstart/), collectors may be duplicated to collect from the same sources.
* Pre-built monitors are not installed.
:::

Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS provides a unified view of threats, misconfigurations, and threats in your AWS infrastructure spanning multiple AWS accounts and regions. The solution leverages native AWS tools and telemetry to accelerate cloud security outcomes.

Key features of the solution include:
* **Risk overview**. See a summary of all resources that pose risks, and get an action plan for addressing the most important areas of concern.
* **Active threats**. See threats in resources and AWS API calls.
* **Security control failures**. See misconfigurations  in your environment that may leave you vulnerable to attackers.
* **Suspicious activity**. See activity identified by anomaly detection across users, web interactions, networks, and Identity Access Management (IAM).

Entities presented in the dashboards are normalized from log sources into [AWS Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/master/ecs-reference.html), to provide seamless pivots between dashboards during threat investigations. 

Use Sumo Logic’s [monitoring](/docs/alerts/monitors/) to receive alerts from the solution. To see monitors for the solution, go to **Manage Data > Monitoring** and select the **Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS** folder.

## Install Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS

### Before you deploy

This section describes prerequisites and guidelines for deploying Sumo Logic’s Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution. 

#### Prerequisites

* **AWS data**. You must have access to data from the following AWS products, since Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS uses data from these sources in its dashboards:
   * [Amazon CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html) 
   * [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html)
   * [AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html)
   * [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)
   * [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) 
* **Sumo Logic console**. Make sure you have access to the [Sumo Logic console](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/) and as a user that is associated with Sumo Logic role and required role capabilities.
* **Role capabilities**. Make sure you have a Sumo Logic role that have the following [role capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/):
  * Manage field extraction rules
  * Manage connections
  * View Account Overview
  * View Fields
  * View field extraction rules
  * Manage Content
  * Manage Collectors
  * View Collectors
  * Manage Fields
  * Manage Monitors
  * Manage Metrics Rules
  * View Monitors
  * Manage Entity Type Configs
  * Create access keys
* **Sumo Logic Access ID and Key**. When you deploy the solution, you’ll need to supply a Sumo Logic [Access ID and Access Key](/docs/manage/security/access-keys/), which enable you to use Sumo Logic APIs. Make sure you have the role capabilities listed above before generating the Access ID and Key.
* **AWS credentials**. To deploy the solution, you will need to log onto the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console). As necessary, you may add JSON text to an existing or a new policy associated with an AWS IAM role as described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-and-attach-iam-policy.html). 
* **Monitors**. The Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution comes with pre-packaged alerts in the form of Sumo Logic Monitors. To learn more about their capabilities, visit the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/) page.

#### Deployment options

For the preview, you can deploy Cloud Security Infrastructure for AWS to a single AWS account and region. 

Typically you would first deploy the solution to a single AWS account and region, kick the tires, and then expand the deployment. 

#### Deployment considerations  

When you deploy the solution, consider the following.

##### Do you already have the required sources? 

When you deploy, you are given the option to create the Sumo Logic sources that the solution applications rely upon. If you have already configured those sources, you do not have to create new ones. You can just provide the URLs of the relevant Sumo Logic sources as part of the configuration.

:::note
If you use existing sources rather than create new ones, it is not necessary to modify the existing metadata and source categories associated with the sources. The metadata that the solution depends on will be added to the sources at deployment time. 
:::

##### Bucket considerations

In the sections of the CloudFormation template that relate to creating Sumo Logic sources, you can specify an existing S3 bucket to store the logs that the source collects. If you don’t supply a bucket name, the template will create a new one. We recommend you use an existing bucket if possible.

### Troubleshoot installation

Installation of Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS uses an AWS CloudFormation template. While deploying using the template, you may receive error messages such as `CREATE_FAILED` status or `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` status for various reasons. This section provides information on how to troubleshoot such AWS CloudFormation installation failures.

#### Determine the cause of a CloudFormation installation failure

This section walks you through the process of troubleshooting an AWS CloudFormation installation failure.

To debug an AWS CloudFormation installation failure, do the following:

1. After the stack rollback is complete and the status is `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`, go to the parent stack. In the parent stack, look for the first failure as shown in the following example. The failure can be a direct reason or can point to a nested stack. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_1.png')} alt="Troubleshooting 1" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="800"/>
1. Look for direct reasons for the failure that is available in the parent stack, as shown in the following example. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_2.png')} alt="Troubleshooting 2" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="800"/>
1. To find indirect reasons for the failure, go to the nested stack mentioned in the status reason, as shown in the following example. Take a note of the resources mentioned in the reason. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_3.png')} alt="Troubleshooting 3" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="800"/>
1. Select the deleted option to find the nested stacks, as shown in the following example.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_4.png')} alt="Troubleshooting 4" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="400"/>
1. Go to the nested stack and look for the resource mentioned in the previous step to identify the reason, as shown in the following example.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_5.png')} alt="Troubleshooting 5" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="800"/>

#### Optimize CloudTrail log ingest

By default, the Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution collects AWS CloudTrail logs for all AWS services. To reduce ingestion volume, you can define processing rules that limit log collection to only the logs that are relevant to dashboards provided by the solution.

Define the processing rules for the Sumo Logic AWS CloudTrail Source that was created when you ran the CloudFormation template.

For instructions, see [Create a Processing Rule](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules/create-processing-rule/). Create the following rules, selecting Include messages that match as the rule type, using these regular expressions:

```
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticloadbalancing\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"dynamodb\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ec2\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"rds\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"lambda\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"apigateway\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ecs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticache\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sns\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sqs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
```

#### Common errors

Below are some common errors that can occur while using the CloudFormation template. 

| Error | Description | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|
| The API rate limit for this user has been exceeded. | This error indicates that AWS CloudFormation execution has exceeded the API rate limit set on the Sumo Logic side. It can occur if you install the AWS CloudFormation template in multiple regions or accounts using the same Access Key and Access ID. | Do not install the AWS CloudFormation template in multiple regions or accounts with the same Access Key and Access ID. |
| S3 Bucket already exists. | The error can occur if:<br/>- An S3 bucket with the same name exists in  S3, or <br/>- The S3 Bucket is not present in S3 but is referenced by some other AWS CloudFormation stack which created it. |- Remove the S3 bucket from S3 or select “No” in the AWS Cloudformation template for S3 bucket creation. <br/>- Remove the AWS CloudFormation Stack which references the S3 bucket. |
| The S3 bucket you tried to delete is not empty. | The error can occur when deleting the stack with a non-empty S3 bucket. | Delete the S3 bucket manually if you do not need the bucket or its content in the future. |

#### Roll back the Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS Solution

When you roll back the solution, all the resources that were created with the AWS CloudFormation stack are deleted. The resources deleted with a rollback include dashboards, collectors, sources, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscriptions. 

Rolling back the solution deletes the main AWS CloudFormation stack, including the nested stack and associated Sumo Logic and AWS resources. The following rollback guidelines apply:

* Sumo Logic resources are deleted based on the “Delete Sumo Logic Resources when the stack is deleted” flag provided during the AWS CloudFormation configuration. These resources include dashboards, collectors, and sources.
* AWS resources are deleted by default, regardless of the flag provided. These resources include S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscription.

To uninstall the Cloud Infrastructure Security solution:

1. Log in to your AWS account and go to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
1. Select the main stack you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/CFT_Uninstall.png')} alt="Delete stack" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="800"/>

## Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS dashboards​

import FilterDashboards from '../../reuse/filter-dashboards.md';

<FilterDashboards/>

### Risk Overview dashboard

The **Risk Overview** dashboard provides a summary of all resources that pose risks in a single dashboard that rolls up the findings from other dashboards. It also shows AWS API events by time, and has an **Action Plan** panel so you can access resources that need attention.

You can also use this dashboard to show details of a single resource. See [View resource risk details](#view-resource-risk-details) below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-risk-overview.png')} alt="Risk Overview dashboard" width="600"/>

#### View resource risk details

You can click a resource on any dashboard to view details about its risk in the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview-dashboard) dashboard:
1. Click a resource in a dashboard. A summary of that resource’s data appears in a panel.
1. In the panel under **Linked Dashboards**, select **Risk Overview**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-linked-dashboard.png')} alt="Linked dashboard" width="600"/>
1. The selected resource’s data appears in the **Risk Overview** dashboard, broken down by the types of data collected. This lets you see at a glance all the different risks presented by the resource. Note at the top of the dashboard that the filters specify the resource.

### Active threats dashboards

The Active Threats dashboards show data on threats that require attention. Review these dashboards to see threats identified in AWS APIs, resources, and storage.

#### Active Threats: AWS APIs

The **Active Threats: AWS APIs** dashboard shows threats identified from AWS APIs by correlating it with threat intelligence data. It shows threats count and trend, and threats by resource, actor, events, and geo location. 

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-active-threats-aws-apis.png')} alt="Active Threats: AWS APIs dashboard" width="600"/>

#### Active Threats: AWS Resources

The **Active Threats: AWS Resources** dashboard shows threats identified in AWS resources such as EC2 and IAMUser as reported by Amazon GuardDuty. It shows findings by resource, trend, resource type, category, and country. This dashboard has an **Action Plan** panel so you can access suggested resources that need attention through the AWS console.

### Security Control Failures dashboard

The **Security Control Failures** dashboard shows resources that need to be addressed because they are vulnerable as reported by AWS Security Hub. It shows findings by resource, trend, type, and category. By default, the `compliance_status` filter at the top of the dashboard is set to **FAILED** to show resources that fail compliance. Set the `risk.calculated_level` filter to **high** or **critical** to see the most important failures.

### Suspicious Activity dashboards

The Suspicious Activity dashboards show data on events identified by anomaly detection that indicate out-of-the ordinary patterns that may require attention. Review these dashboards to see activity identified in configurations, Identity and Access Management (IAM), networks, users, and on the Web. It prioritizes activity by z-score threshold, labeled `risk.calculated_level`, which measures how unusual it is.


#### Suspicious Config and IAM Activity

The **Suspicious Config and IAM Activity** dashboard shows suspicious changes for configurations and Identity Access Management (IAM). It shows suspicious changes in IAM policies, security groups, VPCs, network ACLs, route tables, gateways, S3 bucket permissions, deletion of CMK, and configurations.

#### Suspicious User Activity

The **Suspicious User Activity** dashboard shows suspicious activity that users perform in the cloud. It shows failed console logins, console logins without MFA, console logins from risky geo locations, root account logins, unauthorized AWS API requests, and impossible travel events. 

To see all events a particular user has been involved with, click a user on a panel (a honeycomb cell), and then on the resulting panel under **Linked Dashboards** click **Risk Overview**. For details, see [View resource risk details](#view-resource-risk-details).

## Recommended investigations workflow

To most efficiently use the solution to address security concerns, we recommend the following workflow:
1. Look at the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview-dashboard) dashboard to get an overall picture of the security posture of your environment. Pivot or browse to other dashboards to see details in each area.
1. Look at activity displayed in the [Active Threats](#active-threats-dashboards) dashboards to find issues that need immediate attention. 
1. View the [Security Control Failures](#security-control-failures-dashboard) dashboard to find areas that are identified as failing to meet compliance requirements, and therefore possibly pose a security risk.
1. Review the [Suspicious Activity](#suspicious-activity-dashboards) dashboards to uncover suspicious activity that may need investigation. 
1. Pivot into the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview-dashboard) dashboard for specific resources that have issues to see any related activity. Review the action plan presented at the bottom of the dashboard to work through the items identified as needing attention.
