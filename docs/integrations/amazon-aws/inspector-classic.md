:::

Amazon Inspector allows you to monitor your AWS resources for potential security risks. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon Inspector provides preconfigured searches and Dashboards that give you instant access to an overview of Amazon Inspector as well as details on assessments, runs, and findings.

The App uses a Lambda function to collect assessment run events (notifications) directly from the Amazon Inspector service, which then retrieves further details via the Inspector API, and finally sends them over to a Sumo Logic HTTP Source endpoint.

For more information on Amazon Inspector notifications, see:
[Amazon Inspector Classic assessment templates and assessment runs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_assessments.html).

## Collecting Data for the Amazon Inspector Classic App

For information about our newer app for Amazon Inspector, which leverages findings from AWS Security Hub, see Amazon Inspector.

This section provides instructions for configuring data collection for the Amazon Inspector App.


### Step 1: Configure Collection in Sumo Logic

To collect data for the Amazon Inspector App, do the following:
1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics).


### Step 2: Configure Amazon Inspector

On Amazon Inspector, perform these tasks under the same AWS region:

1. Create an Amazon SNS topic to receive assessment template events.
2. Configure the Amazon Inspector to send findings to the SNS topic.
3. Create an appropriate role to execute a Lambda function and read Inspector data.
4. Set up a Lambda function to fetch data and send to the Sumo Logic HTTP Source endpoint.

Details are provided in the following sections.


### Step 3: Create an Amazon SNS Topic

1. Log in to the Amazon Console.
2. Click Services. In the dropdown go to **Application Integration > Simple Notification Service** (SNS).
3. On the **SNS Dashboard**, select  **Topics** on the left side.
4. A new window opens, select **Create topic** button.
5. In the new window, enter the following details:
    * **Name**: Enter a topic name.
    * **Access Policy:** Select Advance.
    * **JSON Editor:** Replace the existing text with the following.

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "inspector-sns-publish-policy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "inspector-sns-publish-statement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "inspector.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "SNS:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Click **Create Topic** button.


### Step 4: Configure Amazon Inspector

1. In the Amazon Console, click Services. In the opened dropdown, go to **Security, Identity & Compliance > Inspector**.
2. Select assessment templates on the left side.
3. A new window opens, select *each* assessment template you want to monitor.
4. Expand each row and find the section called **SNS topics**.
5. Click the **Edit** icon and select the SNS topic you created in the previous section.
6. Click **Save**.


#### Step 5: Create a Role

1. In the Amazon Console, click Services. In the opened dropdown, go to **Security, Identity & Compliance > IAM**.
2. Select **Roles** on the left side. A new window open, click the **Create role** button.
3. Select **Lambda** and then click **Next: Permissions** button.
4. In the **Attach permissions policy** section, search and select **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** and **AmazonInspectorReadOnlyAccess** policies.
5. Select **Next: Tags** button.
6. Select **Next: Review** button.
7. In the **Review** section, Enter the role name **Lambda-Inspector** and click the **Create role** button.

#### Step 6: Create a Lambda Function

1. In the Amazon Console, click Services. In the opened dropdown, go to **Compute > Lambda**.
2. Click **Create function** button.
3. In the **Author from Scratch** section:
    * **Function name:** Enter function name.
    * **Runtime:** Select the Python 3.7 runtime.
    * **Choose or create an execution role:** Select **Use an existing role** radio button. Select the role created in Step 5.
4. Click **Create function** button.
5. Click the **Add trigger** button.
    * Select **SNS Service.**
    * Select the **SNS topic** you created in create an Amazon SNS Topic as trigger.
6. Click the **Add** button.
7. Click the Function name and go to the **Function code** section.
8. Go to [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-aws-lambda/main/inspector/python/inspector.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-aws-lambda/main/inspector/python/inspector.py) and copy-paste the code in the editor.
9. Edit the code to enter the URL of the Sumo Logic endpoint ( line 14) that will receive data from the HTTP Source.
10. Click **Save** at the top.
11. Scroll down and go to **Edit basic settings** and configure the rest of the settings as follows:
    * **Handler:** lambda_function.sumo_inspector_handler
    * **Memory (MB):** 128
    * **Timeout:** 10 minutes
12. Click **Save**.
