Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a container management service that allows you to manage Docker containers on a cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon ECS provides preconfigured searches and Dashboards that allow you to monitor various metrics (CPU and Memory Utilization, CPU and Memory Reservation) across ECS clusters and services. The App also monitors API calls made by or on behalf of Amazon ECS in your AWS account.

Log and Metrics Types
The App collects ECS logs and metrics for:

ECS CloudWatch Metrics. For details, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS...ch-metrics.htm
ECS Events using AWS CloudTrail. For details, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS...-in-cloudtrail
The actions recorded by CloudTrail for ECS are listed here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS...perations.html
