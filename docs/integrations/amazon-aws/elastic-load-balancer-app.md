The Sumo Logic app for AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Application ingests the logs stored in an S3 bucket, giving you the visibility to see the overall health of your Application Load Balancer and Target Groups. Use the Sumo Logic App to analyze the raw Application Load Balancer data to investigate the availability of the applications running behind Application Load Balancers. Or correlate the Application Load Balancing data with other data sets to get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

For information on collecting unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancer Application, see the AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM Application.

## Log Types

The [Application Load Balancer Access Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) introduces two new fields in addition to the fields contained in Classic ELB Access log:

* `Type` - This is the type of request or connection (HTTP, HTTPS, H2, ws, wss)
* `Target_group_arn` - This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group

The logs are stored in a .gzip format in the specified S3 bucket and contain these fields in this order:

```
type, timestamp, elb, client:port, target:port, request_processing_time, target_processing_time, response_processing_time, elb_status_code, target_status_code, received_bytes, sent_bytes, request, user_agent, ssl_cipher, ssl_protocol, target_group_arn, trace_id
```

For more details on the ALB Access log, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging).

## Collecting Logs for the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Application

### Before you begin

In this step, you'll configure an AWS Elastic Load Balancing source to receive logs. When you create an AWS Source, you associate it with a Hosted Collector. Before creating the Source, identify the Hosted Collector you want to use, or create a new Hosted Collector. For instructions, see [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector). Before you can begin to use the Sumo Logic App for Application Load Balancing, complete the following steps:

1. [Grant Sumo Logic access](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product) to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. [Enable Application Load Balancer logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) in AWS.
3. Confirm that logs are being delivered to the Amazon S3 bucket.

## Installing the AWS ELB Application

Now that you have set up collection for AWS ELB, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancer to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
