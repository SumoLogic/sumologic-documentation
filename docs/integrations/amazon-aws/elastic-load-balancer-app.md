The Sumo Logic AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Application ingests the logs stored in an S3 bucket, giving you the visibility to see the overall health of your Application Load Balancer and Target Groups. Use the Sumo Logic App to analyze the raw Application Load Balancer data to investigate the availability of the applications running behind Application Load Balancers. Or correlate the Application Load Balancing data with other data sets to get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

NoteFor information on collecting unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancer Application, see the AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM Application.
