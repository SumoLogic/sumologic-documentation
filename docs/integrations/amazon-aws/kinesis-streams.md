Amazon Kinesis is a platform for streaming data on AWS. It makes it easy to load and analyze streaming data, and it provides the ability for you to build custom streaming data applications for your needs. Amazon Kinesis Streams is used to collect and process large streams of data records in real time. The Sumo Logic app for Amazon Kinesis - Streams is a unified logs and metrics (ULM) app which provides information on the events and metrics. The preconfigured dashboards help you monitor the events, API calls, errors, incoming and outgoing records, latencies, and throughput of Kinesis Streams.

## Log and Metrics types
For more information on Amazon Kinesis - Streams, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).

The app uses Kinesis logs and metrics for:
* Kinesis CloudWatch Metrics. For details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html).
* Kinesis operations using AWS CloudTrail. For details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the Amazon Kinesis - Streams app

### Collecting Metrics

1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics).
    * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
    * **Description**. Enter an optional description.
    * **Regions**. Select your Amazon Regions for Kinesis.
    * **Namespaces**. Select AWS/Kinesis.
    * **Source** **Category**. Enter a source category. For example, kinesis_metrics.
    * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html).
    * **Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes, or enter the frequency Sumo Logic will scan your CloudWatch Sources for new data.
3. Click **Save**.


### Collect Amazon Kinesis - Streams Events using CloudTrail

1. To your Hosted Collector, add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source.md).
    * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
    * **Description**. Enter an optional description.
    * **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your Kinesis S3 bucket.
    * **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your Kinesis S3 bucket.
    * **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (*) in this string. (DO NOT use a leading forward slash. See [Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions).) The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Donâ€™t include the bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
    * **Source Category**. Enter a source category. For example, kinesis_event.
    * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html).
    * **Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes. Alternately, enter the frequency Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data.
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select the **Extract timestamp information from log file entries** check box.
    * **Time Zone**. Select **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and select **UTC** from the dropdown.
    * **Timestamp Format.** Select **Automatically detect the format**.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Select the **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** check box, and select **Infer Boundaries**.
2. Click **Save**.
