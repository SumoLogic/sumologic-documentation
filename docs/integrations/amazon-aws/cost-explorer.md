[AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer) provides you with a set of default reports that you can use as the starting place for your analysis. From there, use the filtering and grouping capabilities to dive deeper into your cost and usage data and generate custom insights.

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Cost Explorer lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

## Log Types

The **AWS Cost Explorer** App uses the JSON formatted logs collected using **AWS Cost Explorer** source.

### Sample Log

```json
{
   "Timestamp":1647129599999,
   "Estimated":true,
   "Service":"AmazonCloudWatch",
   "Operation":"PutLogEvents",
   "region":"us-east-1",
   "StartDate":"2022-03-12",
   "EndDate":"2022-03-13",
   "CostUsd":0.1326919963,
   "MetricType":"UnblendedCost",
   "Granularity":"Monthly",
   "CostType":"cost_service_operation_region_UnblendedCost_Monthly"
}
```

### Sample Query

The following query sample was taken from the **Cost by Region** panel on the **AWS Cost Explorer - Account** dashboard.

```sql
account={{account}} region CostUsd CostType StartDate EndDate MetricType Granularity Daily
| json "region", "CostUsd", "CostType", "StartDate", "EndDate", "MetricType", "Granularity", "Estimated"
| where MetricType matches "{{MetricType}}" and estimated matches "{{estimated}}"
| where Granularity = "Daily" and CostType = "cost_region_{{MetricType}}_Daily"
| last(CostUsd) as CostUsd by StartDate, EndDate, account, region, CostType, MetricType, Granularity, Estimated
| sum(CostUsd) as total_cost by region
| sort by total_cost, region
| limit 10
```

## Create a AWS Cost Explorer Collector Source

When you create an AWS Cost Explorer collector Source, you add it to an existing Sumo Logic hosted collector. Before creating the Source, you'll need to add a Field-in-Field Schema, Field Extraction Rules, and [identify or create the hosted collector you want to use](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#Create-a-Hosted-Collector).

## Field-in-Field Schema

Log in to Sumo Logic, go to Manage Data > Logs > Fields. Search for the **account** and **linkedaccount** field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields#manage-fields).

## Field Extraction Rules
Create a Field Extraction Rule (FER) for AWS Cost Explorer Logs. Learn how to create a Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

* **Rule Name:** AWSCostExplorerFER
* **Applied at:** Ingest Time
* **Scope (Specific Data):**
  ```sql
  account = * region CostUsd CostType StartDate EndDate MetricType Granularity Service LinkedAccount
  ```
* **Parse Expression:** Enter a parse expression to create an “account” field that maps to the alias you set for each sub account. For example, if you used the “securityprod” alias for an AWS account with ID "123456789" and the “infraprod” alias for an AWS account with ID "987654321", your parse expression would look like:
  ```sql
  json "LinkedAccount"
  | if (LinkedAccount = "123456789",  "securityprod", LinkedAccount ) as LinkedAccount
  | if (LinkedAccount = "987654321",  "infraprod", LinkedAccount ) as LinkedAccount
  ```

## Configure an AWS Cost Explorer Source

import AwsCost from '../../reuse/aws-cost-explorer.md';

<AwsCost/>

## Installing the AWS Cost Explorer App

Now that you have set up a collection for AWS Cost Explorer, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
