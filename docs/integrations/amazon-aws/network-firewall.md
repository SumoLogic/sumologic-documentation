The AWS Network Firewall application provides visibility into traffic flows and alerts generated by AWS Network Firewall.

ImportantOur new app install flow is now in Beta. It is only enabled for certain customers while we gather Beta customer feedback. If you can see the Add Integration button, follow the "Before you begin" section in the "Collect Logs" help page and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app.

Log Types
The AWS Network Firewall application uses logs generated by the AWS Network firewall. It leverages the Netflow and Alert logs.
