AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic distributes the incoming application traffic across multiple EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic is a unified logs and metrics App that helps you monitor the classic load balancer. The preconfigured dashboards provide information on the latency, HTTP backend codes, requests, and host status, that help you investigate the issues in the load balancer.

## Log and Metric Types

ELB logs are stored as *.log files in the buckets you specify when you enable logging. The process to enable collection for these logs is described in [AWS ELB Enable Access Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html).

The logs themselves contain these fields in this order:
```bash
datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, protocol, domain, server_port, path
```

The log format is described in [AWS ELB Access Log Collection](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html).

For details on AWS Classic Load Balancer metrics, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-cloudwatch-metrics.html).

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the AWS Classic Load Balancer

### Collect Metrics for AWS Classic Load Balancer

Sumo Logic supports collecting metrics using two source types
* Configure an [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source) (Recommended); or
* Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics)

Namespace for **AWS Classic Load Balancer** Service is **AWS/ELB**.

* ​​​​**Metadata:** Add an **account** field to the source and assign it a value that is a friendly name/alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting metrics. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Metrics can be queried via the “account field”.


### Collecting Access Logs for AWS Classic Load Balancer

#### Configure a Collector

See [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


#### Before you begin

Before you can begin to use the AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Application App, complete the following steps:

1. [Grant Sumo Logic access](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product) to an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. [Enable Application Load Balancer logging](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) in AWS.
3. Confirm that logs are being delivered to the Amazon S3 bucket.


#### Configure an ELB Source

import Aws3 from '../../reuse/apps/create-aws-s3-source.md';

<Aws3/>

### Field in Field Schema

Login to Sumo Logic, go to Manage Data > Logs > Fields. Search for the **loadbalancername** field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields#manage-fields).


### Field Extraction Rule(s)

Create Field Extraction Rule for AWS Classic Load Balancer Access Logs. Learn how to create Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).
