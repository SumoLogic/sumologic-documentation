* Sumo Logic supports collecting metrics using two source types:
    * Configure an [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source) (recommended); or
    * Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics)
    * Namespace for **Amazon ElastiCache** service is **AWS/ElastiCache**
    * **Metadata**: Add an **account** field to the source and assign it a value which is a friendly name / alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting metrics. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Metrics can be queried via the “account field”.


### Collect Amazon ElastiCache CloudTrail Logs

1. To your Hosted Collector, add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source.md).
   * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
   * **Description**. Enter an optional description.
   * **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your **ElastiCache** S3 bucket.
   * **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your **ElastiCache** S3 bucket.
   * **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (*) in this string. (DO NOT use a leading forward slash. See [Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions).) The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Don’t include the bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
   * **Source Category**. Enter aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs
   * **Fields**. Add an **account** field and assign it a value which is a friendly name / alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting logs. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Logs can be queried via the “account field”.
   * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html). Learn how to use Role-based access to AWS [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources)
   * **Log File Discovery -> Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes. Alternately, enter the frequency. Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data. Learn how to configure **Log File Discovery** [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources).

### Field in Field Schema

Login to Sumo Logic,  goto Manage Data > Logs > Fields. Search for the “**cacheclusterid**” field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields.md#manage-fields).


### Field Extraction Rule(s)

Create a Field Extraction Rule for CloudTrail Logs. Learn how to create a Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

```sql
Rule Name: AwsObservabilityElastiCacheCloudTrailLogsFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): account=* eventname eventsource "elasticache.amazonaws.com"
```

**Parse Expression**

```sql
| json "eventSource", "awsRegion", "requestParameters.cacheClusterId", "responseElements.cacheClusterId", "recipientAccountId" as eventSource, region, req_cacheClusterId, res_cacheClusterId, accountid nodrop
| where eventSource = "elasticache.amazonaws.com"
| if (!isEmpty(req_cacheClusterId), req_cacheClusterId, res_cacheClusterId) as cacheclusterid
| "aws/elasticache" as namespace
| tolowercase(cacheclusterid) as cacheclusterid
| fields region, namespace, cacheclusterid, accountid
```

### Centralized AWS CloudTrail Log Collection

In case you have a centralized collection of CloudTrail logs and are ingesting them from all accounts into a single Sumo Logic CloudTrail log source, create the following Field Extraction Rule to map a proper AWS account(s) friendly name / alias. Create it if not already present / update it as required.

```sql
Rule Name: AWS Accounts
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): _sourceCategory=aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs
```

**Parse Expression**. Enter a parse expression to create an “account” field that maps to the alias you set for each sub account. For example, if you used the `“dev”` alias for an AWS account with ID `"528560886094"` and the `“prod”` alias for an AWS account with ID `"567680881046"`, your parse expression would look like:


```sql
| json "recipientAccountId"
// Manually map your aws account id with the AWS account alias you setup earlier for individual child account
| "" as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "528560886094",  "dev", account) as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "567680881046",  "prod", account) as account
| fields account
```
