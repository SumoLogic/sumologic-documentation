Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. The Sumo Logic app for Amazon SQS is a unified logs and metrics (ULM) app that provides operational insights into your Amazon SQS utilization. The preconfigured dashboards help you monitor the key metrics, view the SQS events for queue activities, and help you plan the capacity of your SQS service utilization.

## Log and Metrics types

The app uses SQS logs and metrics for:
* SQS CloudWatch Metrics. For details, [see here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html).
* SQS operations using AWS CloudTrail. For details, [see here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the Amazon SQS app

### Collect Metrics for AmazonSQS

Sumo Logic supports collecting metrics using two source types:

1. Configure an [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source). (recommended) Or
2. Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics).

:::note
Namespace for **Amazon SQS** Service is **AWS/SQS**
:::

**Metadata**: Add an account field to the source and assign it a value which is a friendly name / alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting metrics. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Metrics can be queried via the “account” field.

![Metadata](https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Amazon-SQS/Metadata+account.png)

### Collect Amazon SQS Events using CloudTrail

1. To your Hosted Collector, add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source).
    * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
    * **Description**. Enter an optional description.
    * **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your SQS S3 bucket.
    * **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your SQS S3 bucket.
    * **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (*) in this string. (DO NOT use a leading forward slash. See [Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions).
    :::note
    The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Don’t include the bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
    :::
    * **Source Category**. Enter aws/observability/CloudTrail/logs.
    * **Fields**. Add an account field and assign it a value which is a friendly name / alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting logs. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Logs can be queried via the “account field”.<br/> ![Account Fields](https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Amazon-SQS/Fields.png)
    * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html).
    * **Log File Interval > Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes. Alternately, enter the frequency Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data.
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select the **Extract timestamp information from log file entries** check box.
    * **Time Zone**. Select **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and select **UTC** from the dropdown.
    * **Timestamp Format.** Select **Automatically detect the format**.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Select the **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** check box, and select **Infer Boundaries**.
2. Click **Save**.

## Field in Field Schema

Login to Sumo Logic, go to **Manage Data** > **Logs** > **Fields**. Search for the `queuename` field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields/#manage-fields).

## Field Extraction Rule(s)
Create a Field Extraction Rule for CloudTrail Logs. Learn how to create a Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

* **Rule Name**: AwsObservabilitySQSCloudTrailLogsFER
* **Applied at**: Ingest Time
* **Scope (Specific Data)**: account=* eventname eventsource "sqs.amazonaws.com"
* **Parse Expression**:

```sql
json "userIdentity", "eventSource", "eventName", "awsRegion", "recipientAccountId", "requestParameters", "responseElements", "sourceIPAddress" as userIdentity, event_source, event_name, region, recipient_account_id, requestParameters, responseElements, src_ip  nodrop
| json field=userIdentity "accountId", "type", "arn", "userName" as accountid, type, arn, username nodrop
| json field=requestParameters "queueUrl" as queueUrlReq nodrop
| json field=responseElements "queueUrl" as queueUrlRes nodrop
| where event_source="sqs.amazonaws.com"
| if(event_name="CreateQueue", queueUrlRes, queueUrlReq) as queueUrl
| parse regex field=queueUrl "(?<queueName>[^\/]*$)"
| if (isBlank(recipient_account_id), accountid, recipient_account_id) as accountid
|! toLowerCase(queuename) as queuename
| "aws/sqs" as namespace
| fields region, namespace, queuename, accountid
```

## Centralized AWS CloudTrail Log Collection

In case you have a centralized collection of CloudTrail logs and are ingesting them from all accounts into a single Sumo Logic CloudTrail log source, create the following **Field Extraction Rule** to map a proper AWS account(s) friendly name/alias. Create it if not already present/update it as required.

* **Rule Name**: AWS Accounts
* **Applied at**: Ingest Time
* **Scope (Specific Data)**: _sourceCategory=aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs
* **Parse Expression**: Enter a parse expression to create an “account” field that maps to the alias you set for each sub account. For example, if you used the “dev” alias for an AWS account with ID "528560886094" and the “prod” alias for an AWS account with ID "567680881046", your parse expression would look like:

```sql
| json "recipientAccountId"
// Manually map your aws account id with the AWS account alias you setup earlier for individual child account
| "" as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "528560886094",  "dev", account) as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "567680881046",  "prod", account) as account
| fields account
```

## Installing the Amazon SQS app

Now that you have set up collection for Amazon SQS, install the Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Amazon SQS dashboards

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that makes it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

The Sumo Logic app for Amazon SQS provides operational insights into your Amazon SQS utilization. The app’s preconfigured dashboards help you monitor the key metrics, view the SQS events for queue activities, and help you plan the capacity of your SQS service utilization.

:::note
We recommend using the [AWS Observability solution Explore View dashboards](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/view-dashboards).
