The app allows you to monitor the number of connections made, CPU utilization, free memory, network utilization, volume read / write IOPS, disk queue depth, replica lags, latency, throughput and other resource utilization details. With Cloudtrail Logs, the app allows you to identify user, client host and client locations being used to configure Aurora PostgreSQL infrastructure.
