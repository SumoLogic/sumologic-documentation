The Sumo Logic App for Aurora PostgreSQL uses unified logs and metrics (ULM) to monitor your Aurora PostgreSQL database. The app allows you to monitor the number of connections made, CPU utilization, free memory, network utilization, volume read / write IOPS, disk queue depth, replica lags, latency, throughput and other resource utilization details. With Cloudtrail Logs, the app allows you to identify user, client host and client locations being used to configure Aurora PostgreSQL infrastructure.

The Sumo Logic App for Aurora PostgreSQL ULM includes predefined searches and dashboards that allow you to monitor logs and metrics for the database. The logs enable you to monitor database activity, user activity, incoming connections, query execution time, and errors. The metrics allow you to monitor database resource utilization and throughput performance.
