Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. You create collections of EC2 instances, called Auto Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes below this size. You can specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size. If you specify the desired capacity, either when you create the group or at any time thereafter, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group has this many instances. If you specify scaling policies, then Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances as demand on your application increases or decreases. For more details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html).

## Log and metric types
* [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-metrics.html)
* [CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html)


## Setup
You can collect the logs and metrics for Sumo Logic's Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling integration by following the below steps.

### Configure metrics collection
* Collect **CloudWatch Metrics** with namespace `AWS/AutoScaling` using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source/) source. For `AWS/AutoScaling` metrics and dimensions, refer to [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-metrics.html).
### Configure logs collection
* Collect [AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html) using [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source/) source. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or a service using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling as events, which includes calls from the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling console and code calls to the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.
