Amazon Route 53 Resolver is a highly available cloud-based DNS service from Amazon. The Sumo Logic Route 53 Resolver Security app enables you to monitor both Query Logs, and if in use, the DNS Firewall logs.

Query logging enables visibility to inbound and outbound DNS queries to the Resolver endpoint. Integrating the logs with Sumo Logic provides insights such as queries by location or instance id.

With [Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-dns-firewall.html), you can filter and regulate outbound DNS traffic for your virtual private cloud (VPC). To do this, you create reusable collections of filtering rules in DNS Firewall rule groups, associate the rule groups to your VPC. By integrating these DNS Firewall logs with Sumo Logic you can monitor VPC activity for misconfigurations and suspicious traffic.

DNS Firewall is a feature of Route 53 Resolver and doesn't require any additional Resolver setup to use.

## Log types

The Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security app uses:
* [Route 53 Resolver query log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logs-example-json.html)
* [DNS Resolver Firewall Log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/firewall-resolver-query-logs-configuring.html)

If you aren't using DNS Resolver Firewall, the Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security app can still provide security insights from your [resolver query logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logs-example-json.html), but data specific to the DNS Resolver Firewall data will not populate in the corresponding panels.

## Collect Logs for the Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security app

This topic has instructions for collecting logs for the Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security app.

### Before you start

If you want to set up Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall, see the Amazon Developer Guide for [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/firewall-resolver-query-logs-configuring.html).  

### Set up collection

1. Create an [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source). Make a note of the **HTTP Source Address** for the source. You'll need it for the Cloudformation template below.
2. Set up CloudWatch to stream logs to Kinesis Data Firehose using the [Cloudformation Template](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source#CloudFormation_Template)
3. In this step, enable DNS query logging, as described in [Managing Resolver query logging configurations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-query-logging-configurations-managing.html) in AWS help.
   * When you select the type of AWS resource to which you want Resolver to send query logs, choose **Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream** as the Destination for the Query Logs.
   * Click **Browse streams** and select the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that was created by the Sumo Logic CloudFormation template. It should start with ​​`Kinesis-Logs-<random-string>`.
   * Click **Add VPC** in the **VPCs to log queries for** section.
4. Complete your configuration by clicking **Configure query logging** at the bottom of the page.
5. Your new configuration will now be listed.

## Installing the Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security app

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-v2.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security dashboards

import ViewDashboards from '../../reuse/apps/view-dashboards.md';

<ViewDashboards/>

### Query Logging Overview

The Query Logging Overview Dashboard provides insights into DNS activities such as DNS queries by location, VPC and instance ID. Additional security information is provided, including blocked and alerted DNS queries from the Route 53 DNS Resolver Firewall, and Threat Intel matches from Sumo Logic's CrowdStrike integration.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/Amazon-Route-53-Resolver-Security-Query-Logging-Overview.png')} alt="Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security Dashboards" />

Use this dashboard to:

* Identify unusual or changes in DNS activity.
* Identify possible malicious or anomalous behavior by reviewing high entropy domains, most and least queried domains.
* Analyze DNS requests violating your Route 53 DNS Resolver Firewall policies.
* Review Threat Intel matches.

Panels include:
* IPv4 Resolution by Geo Location
* Top 10 Queried Domains
* Least 10 Queried Domains
* DNS Queries Over 24H by Type and VPC-ID
* DNS Queries by Instance ID and Source Address
* Top 50 Highest Entropy Domains
* Total Hits from Threat Intel Source
* Threats Over Time
* Threat Outlier
* Anomalies within Alerted DNS Queries
* Anomalies within Blocked DNS Queries
* Alerted DNS Queries by Instance ID Over Time
* Top 10 Alerted Domains
* Top 10 Blocked Domains
* Blocked DNS Queries by Instance ID Over Time


### Resolver DNS Firewall

The Resolver DNS Firewall Dashboard provides monitoring and insights into DNS Firewall activity.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/Amazon-Route-53-Resolver-Security-Resolver-DNS-Firewall.png')} alt="Amazon Route 53 Resolver Security Dashboards" />

Use this Dashboard to:
* Analyze Blocked and Alerted DNS Queries by Domain, Instance ID, Rule Group ID, Domain List ID
* Help identify possible DNS exfiltration attempts
* Identify communications to known bad domains


Panels include:
* Alerted Queries IPv4 Resolution by GeoLocation
* Alerted DNS Queries by Rule Group ID & Domain List ID

### Security Detail

Security Detail Dashboard provides insights into DNS activities such as number of DNS requests and data throughput by VPC and instance ID. The Dashboard also provides a detailed drill down per request, displaying information such as the request, request type, ASN Number and ASN Org Name and DNS Resolver Firewall Actions.
