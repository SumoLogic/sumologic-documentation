Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. The Sumo Logic App for Elastic Load Balancing ingests logs generated by this activity, providing greater visibility into events that, in turn, help you understand the overall health of your EC2 deployment. For example, you can use the Sumo Logic App to analyze raw Elastic Load Balancing data to investigate the availability of applications running behind Elastic Load Balancers. Or, by correlating Elastic Load Balancing data with other data sets, you can get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

For information on unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing App, see the AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM Application.

## Log Types

ELB logs are stored as .log files in the buckets you specify when you enable logging. The process to enable collection for these logs is described in [AWS ELB Enable Access Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html). The logs themselves contain these fields in this order:
```bash
datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, protocol, domain, server_port, path
```

## Collecting Logs for the AWS Elastic Load Balancing App

This procedure documents how to enable access to your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logs and ingest them into Sumo Logic.

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page in Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.

### Prerequisites

* Enable Elastic Load Balancing logging in your AWS account, using these Sumo Logic [instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-elastic-load-balancing-source). For more information, see [AWS ELB documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html). Logging is not enabled in AWS ELB by default.
* Grant access to an IAM user by following these Sumo Logic [instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).
* Confirm that logs are being delivered to the Amazon S3 bucket.

To enable logging in AWS:
1. In the **AWS Management Console**, choose **EC2 > Load Balancers**.
2. Under **Access Logs**, click **Edit**.
3. In the **Configure Access Logs** dialog box, click **Enable Access Logs**, then choose an Interval and S3 bucket. This is the S3 bucket that will upload logs to Sumo Logic.
4. Click **Save**.

If you have more than one environment that generates Elastic Load Balancing data (such as ops, dev, and so on) you’ll need to configure a separate S3 Source for each environment. This means that you’ll have the three App Dashboards for each environment. To avoid confusion, and in order to identify which environment is generating data, you should name each S3 Source with the environment's name. For example, you might name Sources as ELB-prod, ELB-dev, ELB-test, and so on.

Finally, make copies of each Panel in the Elastic Load Balancing Dashboards, and modify the search logic in each Panel so that you select the appropriate source for each environment. For example, for a production environment, you will add the string: _source=ELB-production to the beginning of each search. If you have three environments then you will have three copies of the application for each of them (nine dashboards in total).


### Configure a Collector

Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Configure a Source

Configure an [AWS Elastic Load Balancing Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-elastic-load-balancing-source), which includes specifying the following:

* Source fields:
    * **Bucket Name**. (Required) ELB, for example.
    * **Path Expression**. For example, `my-bucket/prefix/AWSLogs/123456789012/*.log`
    * **Source Category**. (Required) ELB_Prod, for example. For details see [Best Practices](/docs/send-data/best-practices).
* Advanced:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. True
    * **Time Zone**. Logs are in UTC by default
    * **Timestamp Format**. Auto Detect


### Field Extraction Rules

For Field Extraction Rules, use the source category established earlier.

```bash title="AWS Elastic Load Balancing Logs"
parse "* * *:* *:* * * * * * * * \"* *://*:*/* HTTP" as datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, protocol, domain, server_port, path
```


## Installing the AWS ELB App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS ELB, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancing to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards to analyze your data.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

### What if data isn't displaying in all Panels?

Amazon S3 buckets are scanned for new files according to the Scan Interval you set when configuring the S3 Source used for AWS Elastic Load Balancing logs. Even if you set a shorter Scan Interval, say five minutes, if no new files are found, the Scan Interval is automatically doubled, up to 24 hours (you can read more in [Set the S3 Source Scan Interval](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-scan-interval-sources)). If the Scan Interval increases, it means that a Panel set to a 60-minute time range may not find any data to display, because no files have uploaded to Sumo Logic. This isn't to say that no data is being collected from your S3 bucket; you can confirm that data is being collected on the Status page.

Additionally, you can change the time range of a Panel. Even though these Panels have been preconfigured, they can be edited just like any other Panel. You'll find instructions in Changing the time range of a Panel.


## Viewing AWS ELB Dashboards

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancing helps you monitor the overall health of your ELB deployment. Dashboards keep an eye on errors being generated by back-end applications as well as errors generated from ELB instances.


### Overview
