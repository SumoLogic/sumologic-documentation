Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. The Sumo Logic App for Elastic Load Balancing ingests logs generated by this activity, providing greater visibility into events that, in turn, help you understand the overall health of your EC2 deployment. For example, you can use the Sumo Logic App to analyze raw Elastic Load Balancing data to investigate the availability of applications running behind Elastic Load Balancers. Or, by correlating Elastic Load Balancing data with other data sets, you can get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

For information on unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing App, see the AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM Application.

If you are just beginning with AWS ELB, for background see the Sumo Logic DevOps blog, AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Load Balancer Best Practices.
