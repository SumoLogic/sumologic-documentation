Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending and receiving service. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon SES helps you monitor the email platform activities. The app uses CloudTrail events and SES notifications, and provides pre-configured dashboards that provide insights on the status of the email delivery including bounced notifications, delivered notifications, and various SES CloudTrail events.

## Log Types

The Amazon SES App uses:
* AWS CloudTrail events for SES. For more details, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail). 
* SES Notifications. For more details, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitor-sending-using-notifications.html). 

Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is a cloud-based email sending and receiving service. The Amazon SES App helps you monitor the email platform activities, utilizing CloudTrail events and SES notifications (via SNS).

## Collecting Logs for the Amazon SES App

This section provides instructions for collecting CloudTrail Event logs and SES Notifications Via SNS.

### Step 1. Plan Source Categories

Before you configure the log sources for the Amazon SES app, decide on the source category you will assign to each. A hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards when you perform searches. For example:

* For the AWS CloudTrail source for CloudTrail Events, you could specify a source category of AWS/CloudTrail
* For the Amazon SES Notifications Via SNS, you could specify a source category of AWS/SES/Events/Notifications


### Step 2: Configure CloudTrail

1. Enable CloudTrail in your AWS account. You'll be offered the option to create an S3 bucket.
2. [Grant Sumo Logic access](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product) to the Amazon S3 bucket created or selected above.


### Step 3: Collect Amazon SES events using CloudTrail

1. In Sumo Logic select** Manage Data > Collection > Collection**.
2. On the **Collectors** page, click **Add Source** next to a Hosted** **Collector, either an existing Hosted Collector, or one you have created for this purpose.
3. Select AWS CloudTrail as your AWS Source type.
4. Enter a name for the new Source. A description is optional.
5. Select an **S3 region** or keep the default value of **Others**. The S3 region must match the appropriate S3 bucket created in your Amazon account.

:::info
Selecting an AWS GovCloud region means your data will be leaving a FedRAMP-high environment. Use responsibly to avoid information spillage. See [Collection from AWS GovCloud](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/collection-aws-govcloud) for details.
:::

6. For **Bucket Name**, enter the exact name of your organization's S3 bucket. Be sure to double-check the name as it appears in AWS, for example:

7. For **Path Expression**, enter the wildcard pattern that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use **one **wildcard (*) in this string. Recursive path expressions use a single wildcard and do **NOT** use a leading forward slash. [See About Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions) for details.
8. **Collection should begin.** Choose or enter how far back you'd like to begin collecting historical logs. You can either:
    * Choose a predefined value from dropdown list, ranging from "Now" to “72 hours ago” to “All Time”, or
    * Enter a relative value. To enter a relative value, click the **Collection should begin** field and press the delete key on your keyboard to clear the field. Then, enter a relative time expression, for example `-1w`. You can define when you want collection to begin in terms of months (M), weeks (w), days (d), hours (h), and minutes (m). If you paused the Source and want to skip some data when you resume, update the **Collection should begin** setting to a time after it was paused.
    :::note
    <CollBegin/>
    :::
9. For **Source Category**, enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source. (Category metadata is stored in a searchable field called `_sourceCategory`.)
10. **Fields**. Click the **+Add Field** link to add custom log metadata [Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md). Then define the fields you want to associate, each field needs a name (key) and value.
    * ![green check circle.png](/img/reuse/green-check-circle.png) A green circle with a check mark is shown when the field exists and is enabled in the Fields table schema.
    * ![orange exclamation point.png](/img/reuse/orange-exclamation-point.png) An orange triangle with an exclamation point is shown when the field doesn't exist, or is disabled, in the Fields table schema. In this case, an option to automatically add or enable the nonexistent fields to the Fields table schema is provided. If a field is sent to Sumo that does not exist in the Fields schema or is disabled it is ignored, known as dropped.
11. For **AWS Access** you have two **Access Method** options. Select **Role-based access** or **Key access** based on the AWS authentication you are providing. Role-based access is preferred, this was completed in the prerequisite step [Grant Sumo Logic access to an AWS Product](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).
    * For **Role-based access** enter the Role ARN that was provided by AWS after creating the role.  \
    * For **Key access** enter the **Access Key ID **and** Secret Access Key.** See [AWS Access Key ID](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/UsingTokens.html#RequestWithSTS) and [AWS Secret Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for details.
12. **Log File Discovery.** You have the option to set up Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to notify Sumo Logic of new items in your S3 bucket. A scan interval is required and automatically applied to detect log files.
    * **Scan Interval.** Sumo Logic will periodically scan your S3 bucket for new items in addition to SNS notifications. **Automatic** is recommended to not incur additional AWS charges. This sets the scan interval based on if subscribed to an SNS topic endpoint and how often new files are detected over time. If the Source is not subscribed to an SNS topic and set to **Automatic** the scan interval is 5 minutes. You may enter a set frequency to scan your S3 bucket for new data. To learn more about Scan Interval considerations, see [About setting the S3 Scan Interval](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-scan-interval-sources).
    * **SNS Subscription Endpoint (Highly Recommended**). New files will be collected by Sumo Logic as soon as the notification is received. This will provide faster collection versus having to wait for the next scan to detect the new file. Click the box below to open instructions:

    <details>
    <summary>Set up SNS in AWS</summary>

    The following steps use the Amazon SNS Console. You may instead use AWS CloudFormation. Follow the instructions to use [CloudFormation to set up an SNS Subscription Endpoint](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/configure-your-aws-source-cloudformation#set-up-an-sns-subscription-endpoint).

    1. To set up the subscription you need to get an endpoint URL from Sumo to provide to AWS. This process will save your Source and begin scanning your S3 bucket when the endpoint URL is generated. Click **Create URL** and use the provided endpoint URL when creating your subscription in step 3.

     Sumo Logic highly recommends using an SNS Subscription Endpoint for its ability to maintain low-latency collection. This is essential to support up-to-date [Alerts](/docs/alerts).

    2. Go to **Services >** **Simple Notification Service** and click **Create Topic**. Enter a **Topic name** and click **Create topic**. Copy the provided **Topic ARN**, you’ll need this for the next step. Make sure that the topic and the bucket are in the same region.
    3. Again go to **Services >** **Simple Notification Service** and click **Create Subscription**. Paste the **Topic ARN** from step 2 above. Select **HTTPS** as the protocol and enter the **Endpoint** URL provided while creating the S3 source in Sumo Logic. Click **Create subscription** and a confirmation request will be sent to Sumo Logic. The request will be automatically confirmed by Sumo Logic.
    4. Select the **Topic** created in step 2 and navigate to **Actions > Edit Topic Policy**. Use the following policy template, replace the `SNS-topic-ARN` and `bucket-name` placeholders in the `Resource` section of the JSON policy with your actual SNS topic ARN and S3 bucket name:
    ```
    {
        "Version": "2008-10-17",
        "Statement": [{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "*"
            },
            "Action": [
                "SNS:Publish"
            ],
            "Resource": "SNS-topic-ARN",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:bucket-name"
                }
            }
        }]
    }
    ```
    5. Go to Services > [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/) and select the bucket to which you want to attach the notifications. Navigate to **Properties > Events > Add Notification**. Enter a **Name** for the event notification. In the **Events** section select **All object create events**. In the **Send to** section (notification destination) select **SNS Topic**. An **SNS** section becomes available, select the name of the topic you created in step 2 from the dropdown. Click **Save**.

    </details>


13. Set any of the following under **Advanced**:
  * **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** This option is selected by default. If it's deselected, no timestamp information is parsed at all.
    * **Time Zone.** There are two options for Time Zone. You can use the time zone present in your log files, and then choose an option in case time zone information is missing from a log message. Or, you can have Sumo Logic completely disregard any time zone information present in logs by forcing a time zone. It's very important to have the proper time zone set, no matter which option you choose. If the time zone of logs can't be determined, Sumo Logic assigns logs UTC; if the rest of your logs are from another time zone your search results will be affected.
    * **Timestamp Format.** By default, Sumo Logic will automatically detect the timestamp format of your logs. However, you can manually specify a timestamp format for a Source. See [Timestamps, Time Zones, Time Ranges, and Date Formats](/docs/send-data/reference-information/time-reference) for more information.
* **Enable Multiline Processing. **See [Collecting Multiline Logs](/docs/send-data/reference-information/collect-multiline-logs) for details on multiline processing and its options. This is enabled by default. Use this option if you're working with multiline messages (for example, log4J or exception stack traces). Deselect this option if you want to avoid unnecessary processing when collecting single-message-per-line files (for example, Linux system.log). Choose one of the following:  
    * **Infer Boundaries.** Enable when you want Sumo Logic to automatically attempt to determine which lines belong to the same message. If you deselect the Infer Boundaries option, you will need to enter a regular expression in the Boundary Regex field to use for detecting the entire first line of multiline messages.
    * **Boundary Regex.** You can specify the boundary between messages using a regular expression. Enter a regular expression that matches the entire first line of every multiline message in your log files.
14. [Create any Processing Rules](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules/create-processing-rule) you'd like for the AWS Source.
15. When you are finished configuring the Source, click **Save**.


### Step 4: Configure and collect Amazon SNS notifications for Amazon SES

1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an  [HTTP](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) source.
* **Name—**Enter a name to display for the new Source.
* **Description—**Enter an optional description.
* **Source Category—**Enter a source category, such as: AWS/SES/Events/Notifications
* **Timestamp Parsing Settings**:
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing—**True
    * **Timezone—**Logs are sent in UTC by default and can be auto detected
    * **Timestamp Format—**Auto Detect
* Deselect checkbox—Enable Multiline Processing
* **Enable** — One Message Per Request
3. Click **Save.**

    **Note the source EndPoint URL**. Once an HTTP Source is added, it generates a URL which will be used to receive notifications from SNS. The URL looks like `https://collectors.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/ABCDEFGHIJK`.

4. You are going to send SES Notifications to SNS and then from SNS forward them to Sumo Logic. Have your Amazon SNS topic ready to receive SES notifications. Create SNS Topic, if not already created in SNS Service at AWS account from which to forward events to Sumo. Follow instructions in the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-sns-notifications.html#configure-feedback-notifications-prerequisites) to setup an SNS topic to receive SES notifications.

    **Note the SNS Topic ARN**, as you'll need it to set the subscription.

5. Whenever the SNS topic referred to in the previous step receives SES notification, forward the received notification to registered subscribers of that SNS topic. Now, subscribe Sumo Logic endpoint as subscriber. Create a Subscription to the SNS Topic you just created, specifying the following:
    * Topic ARN—from the [Step 4](#TopicARN).
    * Protocol — **HTTPS**
    * EndPoint — Sumo source Endpoint URL you noted in [Step 3](#EndpointURL).
6. After a subscription is created, Amazon SNS sends a [subscription confirmation ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SendMessageToHttp.html#SendMessageToHttp.confirm)message to the Sumo source endpoint. Do the following:
    * Go to the Sumo search box and execute the following:
     ```
     _sourceCategory=AWS/SES/Events/Notifications SubscribeURL
     ```
    * Look in Sumo for the source category, and get the SubscribeURL field value. You need to confirm the subscription by entering the SubscribeURL field value in the **Subscription confirmation URL** field.
    * Go to **AWS Account > SNS service**, and select the subscription you just created. Then, choose **Confirm Subscription**, paste the SubscribeURL, and click **Confirm Subscription**.
7. Select the subscription, then under **Other Subscription actions** or **Actions**, select **Edit Subscription Attributes**, check the check box for **Raw message delivery**, and click **Set Subscription attributes**. This delivers a message to Sumo source with only one field as raw.
8. After completing successful subscription, Configure Notifications Using the Amazon SES Console. For detailed instructions, see the [Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/configure-sns-notifications.html#configure-feedback-notifications-console).

:::note
SES sends notifications to SNS in a JSON format. Any notification sent through SNS is by default wrapped into a JSON message. This then creates a nested JSON that is a nearly unreadable message. To prevent the problem of nested JSON messages, we highly recommend configuring SNS to use [raw message ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/large-payload-raw-message.html)delivery option.
:::



## Installing the Amazon SES App

Now that you have set up collection for Amazon SES, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

To install the app:
1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app. You can click **Preview Dashboards** to verify that you have the app you need.
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library** and complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    2. **Data Source**. Select either of these options for **SES CloudTrail Log Source**, and **SES Notification Log Source**.
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list.
            * For SES CloudTrail Logs, provide sourceCategory as **AWS/CloudTrail**
            * For SES Notification Logs, provide sourceCategory as **AWS/SES/Notifications**
        * **Choose Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`).
3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your Personal folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization. See [Welcome to the New Library] for information on working with the library in the new UI.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
