Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a DynamoDB-compatible caching service that enables you to benefit from fast in-memory performance for demanding applications. Amazon DynamoDB response times can be measured in single-digit milliseconds. If you require response times in microseconds, DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) delivers fast response times for accessing eventually consistent data. For more details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAX.html).
