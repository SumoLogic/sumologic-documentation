The Threat Intel for AWS App correlates CrowdStrike threat intelligence data with your AWS log data, allowing for real-time security analytics to help detect threats in your environment and protect against cyber-attacks. The Threat Intel for AWS App scans your AWS CloudTrail, AWS ELB and AWS VPC Flow logs for threats based on IP address.

The Sumo Logic Threat Intel lookup database is only available with Sumo Logic Enterprise and Professions accounts, or during a 30-day trial period. The Threat Intel lookup database is not available for Sumo Logic Free accounts.
