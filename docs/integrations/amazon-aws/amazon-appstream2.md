Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed application streaming service that provides users with instant access to their desktop applications from anywhere. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources required to host and run your applications, scales automatically, and provides access to your users on demand. AppStream 2.0 provides users access to the applications they need on the device of their choice, with a responsive, fluid user experience that is indistinguishable from natively installed applications. For more details, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/what-is-appstream.html).

## Log and metric types
* [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/monitoring.html#monitoring-with-cloudwatch)
* [CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html)

## Setup

You can collect the logs and metrics for Sumo Logic's Amazon AppStream 2.0 integration by following the below steps.

### Configure metrics collection

* Collect **CloudWatch Metrics** with namespace `AWS/AppStream` using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source/) source. For `AWS/AppStream` metrics and dimensions, refer to [Amazon AppStream 2.0 CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/monitoring.html#monitoring-with-cloudwatch).

### Configure logs collection

* Collect [AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html) using the [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source/) source. Amazon AppStream 2.0 is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service in AppStream 2.0. CloudTrail captures API calls for AppStream 2.0 as events, which include calls from the AppStream 2.0 console and code calls to the AppStream 2.0 API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for AppStream 2.0.
