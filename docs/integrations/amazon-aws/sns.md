Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications service for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients.

The Sumo Logic App for Amazon SNS is a unified logs and metrics (ULM) App that provides insights into the operations and utilization of your SNS service. The preconfigured dashboards help you monitor the key metrics by application, platform, region, and topic name, view the SNS events for activities, and help you plan the capacity of your SNS service.

Log and Metrics Types
The App uses SNS logs and metrics:

SNS CloudWatch Metrics. For details, see here. 
SNS operations using AWS CloudTrail. For details, see here.
