Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications service for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients.

The Sumo Logic app for Amazon SNS collects CloudTrail logs and CloudWatch metrics provides a unified logs and metrics app that provides insights into the operations and utilization of your SNS service. The preconfigured dashboards help you monitor the key metrics by application, platform, region, and topic name, view the SNS events for activities, and help you plan the capacity of your SNS service.

## Log and Metrics types

The Sumo Logic app for Amazon SNS uses:
* SNS CloudWatch Metrics. For details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sns-metricscollected.html). 
* SNS operations using AWS CloudTrail. For details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the Amazon SNS app

### Collecting Metrics for Amazon SNS  

1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics) or [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source) (Recommended).
3. Namespaces. Select **aws/sns**.
4. **Metadata**. Add an **account** field to the source and assign it a value that is a friendly name/alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting metrics. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. The **account** field allows you to query metrics.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Amazon-SNS/Metadata%2Baccount.png')} alt="Metadata" />
5. Click **Save**.

### Collecting Amazon SNS Events using CloudTrail

1. Add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source.md) to your Hosted Collector.
    * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
    * **Description**. Enter an optional description.
    * **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your SNS S3 bucket.
    * **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your SNS S3 bucket.
    * **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (*) in this string.
      * DO NOT use a [leading forward slash](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions).
      * The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Don’t include the bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
    * **Source Category**. Enter a source category. For example, enter `aws/observability/CloudTrail/logs`.
    * **Fields**. Add an account field and assign it a value that is a friendly name/alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting logs. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Logs can be queried using the **account** field. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Amazon-SNS/Fields.png')} alt="Fields" />
    * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html). Learn how to use Role-based access to AWS [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources).
    * **Log File Discovery -> Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes. Alternately, enter the frequency. Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data. Learn how to configure Log File Discovery [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources).
    * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select the **Extract timestamp information from log file entries** check box.
    * **Time Zone**. Select **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and select **UTC** from the dropdown.
    * **Timestamp Format.** Select **Automatically detect the format**.
    * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Select the **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** check box, and select **Infer Boundaries**.
2. Click **Save**.

### Field in Field Schema

Login to Sumo Logic, go to Manage Data > Logs > Fields. Search for the `"topicname"` field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields#manage-fields).

### Field Extraction Rule(s)

Create a Field Extraction Rule for CloudTrail Logs. Learn how to create a Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

```sql
Rule Name: AwsObservabilitySNSCloudTrailLogsFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data): account=* eventname eventsource \"sns.amazonaws.com\"
```

**Parse Expression**:

```sql
| json "userIdentity", "eventSource", "eventName", "awsRegion", "recipientAccountId", "requestParameters", "responseElements" as userIdentity, event_source, event_name, region, recipient_account_id, requestParameters, responseElements nodrop
| where event_source = "sns.amazonaws.com"
| json field=userIdentity "accountId", "type", "arn", "userName"  as accountid, type, arn, username nodrop
| parse field=arn ":assumed-role/*" as user nodrop
| parse field=arn "arn:aws:iam::*:*" as accountid, user nodrop
| json field=requestParameters "topicArn", "name", "resourceArn", "subscriptionArn" as req_topic_arn, req_topic_name, resource_arn, subscription_arn  nodrop
| json field=responseElements "topicArn" as res_topic_arn nodrop
| if (isBlank(req_topic_arn), res_topic_arn, req_topic_arn) as topic_arn
| if (isBlank(topic_arn), resource_arn, topic_arn) as topic_arn
| parse field=topic_arn "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*" as region_temp, accountid_temp, topic_arn_name_temp nodrop
| parse field=subscription_arn "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*:*" as region_temp, accountid_temp, topic_arn_name_temp, arn_value_temp nodrop
| if (isBlank(req_topic_name), topic_arn_name_temp, req_topic_name) as topicname
| if (isBlank(accountid), recipient_account_id, accountid) as accountid
| "aws/sns" as namespace
| fields region, namespace, topicname, accountid
```

## Centralized AWS CloudTrail Log Collection
In case, you have a centralized collection of CloudTrail logs and are ingesting them from all accounts into a single Sumo Logic CloudTrail log source, create the following **Field Extraction Rule** to map a proper AWS account(s) friendly name/alias. Create it if not already present or update it as required.

* **Rule Name**: AWS Accounts
* **Applied at**: Ingest Time
* **Scope (Specific Data)**: `_sourceCategory=aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs`
* **Parse Expression**: Enter a parse expression to create an “account” field that maps to the alias you set for each sub account. For example, if you used the “dev” alias for an AWS account with ID "528560886094" and the “prod” alias for an AWS account with ID "567680881046", your parse expression would look like:

```sql
| json "recipientAccountId"
// Manually map your aws account id with the AWS account alias you setup earlier for individual child account
| "" as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "528560886094",  "dev", account) as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "567680881046",  "prod", account) as account
| fields account
```
