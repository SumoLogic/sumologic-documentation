Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon S3 Audit presents details from access logs that contain information about the request type, the average response time, and the inbound and outbound data volume.

ImportantOur new app install flow is now in Beta. It is only enabled for certain customers while we gather Beta customer feedback. If you can see the Add Integration button, follow the "Before you begin" section in the "Collect Logs" help page and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app.
