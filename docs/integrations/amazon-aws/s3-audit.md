Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon S3 Audit presents details from access logs that contain information about the request type, the average response time, and the inbound and outbound data volume.


## Log Types

Amazon S3 Audit uses Server Access Logs (activity logs). For more information on the log format, see: [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/LogFormat.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/LogFormat.html).


### Sample Log Message

The server access log files consist of a sequence of new-line delimited log records. Each log record represents one request and consists of space delimited fields. The following is an example log consisting of six log records.

```json

## Collecting Logs for the Amazon S3 Audit App

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

This topic details how to collect logs for Amazon S3 Audit and ingest them into Sumo Logic.

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the Account page in  Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.


### Before you begin

Before you can begin to collect logs from an S3 bucket, perform the following steps:

1. [Enable logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html) via the AWS Management Console.
2. Confirm that logs are being delivered to an S3 bucket.
3. [Grant Sumo Logic Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).


### Configure a Collector

In Sumo Logic, configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Configure an S3 Audit Source

import Aws3 from '../../reuse/apps/create-aws-s3-source.md';

<Aws3/>

### Field Extraction Rules

Field Extraction Rules (FERs) tell Sumo Logic which fields to parse out automatically. For instructions, see [Create a Field Extraction Rule](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).

Use the following Parse Expression:

```sql
parse "* * [*] * * * * * \"* HTTP/1.1\" * * * * * * * \"*\" *" as bucket_owner, bucket, time, remoteIP, requester, request_ID, operation, key, request_URI, status_code, error_code, bytes_sent, object_size, total_time, turn_time, referrer, user_agent, version_ID
```

## Installing the Amazon S3 Audit App

Now that you have configured log collection for Amazon S3 Audit, install the Sumo Logic App for Amazon S3, and take advantage of predefined Searches and dashboards. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon S3 Audit presents details from access logs that contain information about the request type, the average response time, and the inbound and outbound data volume.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';
