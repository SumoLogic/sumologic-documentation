The AWS Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, receives requests, evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group.

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Application Load Balancing uses logs and metrics to give you visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups. Use the pre-configured dashboards to understand the latency, request and host status, threat intel, and HTTP backend codes by availability zone and target group.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics


### Log Types

The App uses:

* The metrics are included in the AWS/ApplicationELB namespace. For more details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/elb-metricscollected.html#load-balancer-metrics-alb).
* The [Application Load Balancer Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) Log introduces two new fields in addition to the fields contained in the Classic ELB Access log:
    1. **Type. **This is the type of request or connection (HTTP, HTTPS, H2, ws, wss)
    2. **Target_group_arn**. This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group
* The logs are stored in a .gzip format in the specified S3 bucket and contain these fields in this order:


```
timestamp, elb, client:port, target:port, request_processing_time, target_processing_time, response_processing_time, elb_status_code, target_status_code, received_bytes, sent_bytes, request, user_agent, ssl_cipher, ssl_protocol, target_group_arn, trace_id
```

The log format is described in [AWS Application Load Balancer Access Log Collection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html)


### Metrics Types

## Installing the AWS Application Load Balancer App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS Application Load Balancer, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured searches and [dashboards](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/01Amazon_and_AWS/AWS_Classic_Load_Balancer/Install-the-AWS-Classic-Load-Balancer-App-and-view-the-Dashboards#Dashboards) that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

**To install the app:**

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library** and complete the following fields.
    * **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.â€¨
    * **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
    * Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.



## Viewing AWS Application Load Balancer Dashboards


### Overview

The** AWS Application Load Balancer - Overview** dashboard provides visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups, with at-a-glance views of latency, request and host status, requests from malicious sources, and HTTP backend codes.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor requests to each load balancer to ensure the load is being distributed as desired.
* Quickly identify healthy and unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor trends for load balancers errors, 4xx, and 5xx errors, as well as healthy and unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor the current state across all load balancers via active connections, new connections, target connection errors, and rejected connections.

### Connection and Host Status

The** AWS Application Load Balancer - Connection and Host Status** dashboard provides insights into active and rejected connections, target connection errors, and healthy and unhealthy hosts.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor active connections, new connections, rejected connections, and connection errors for the load balancer.
* Monitor healthy and unhealthy host counts by the load balancer, target group, and availability zone across your infrastructure.

### Requests and Processed Bytes

The** AWS Application Load Balancer - Requests and Processed Bytes** dashboard provides insights into client requests, network traffic, and processed data.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor client request load, network traffic, and processed bytes to determine how to best configure load balancers for optimal performance.
* Determine how to best allocate backend resources and target groups based on load.

### Threat Intel

The **AWS Application Load Balancer - Threat Intel** dashboard provides insights into incoming requests from malicious sources determined via [Sumo Logicâ€™s Threat Intel feature](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/22Security_and_Threat_Detection/Threat_Intel_Quick_Analysis/03_Threat-Intel-FAQ). Panels show detailed information on malicious IPs and the malicious confidence of each threat.

Use this dashboard to:
* Identify known malicious IPs that are access your load-balancers and use firewall access control lists to prevent them from sending you traffic going forward
* Monitor the malicious confidence level for all incoming malicious IP addresses the threats.
