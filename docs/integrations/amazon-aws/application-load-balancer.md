The AWS Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, receives requests, evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group.

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Application Load Balancing uses logs and metrics to give you visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups. Use the pre-configured dashboards to understand the latency, request and host status, threat intel, and HTTP backend codes by availability zone and target group.


## Log Types

The App uses:

* The metrics are included in the AWS/ApplicationELB namespace. For more details, see [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/elb-metricscollected.html#load-balancer-metrics-alb).
* The [Application Load Balancer Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) Log introduces two new fields in addition to the fields contained in the Classic ELB Access log:
    1. **Type. **This is the type of request or connection (HTTP, HTTPS, H2, ws, wss)
    2. **Target_group_arn**. This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group
* The logs are stored in a .gzip format in the specified S3 bucket and contain these fields in this order:


```
timestamp, elb, client:port, target:port, request_processing_time, target_processing_time, response_processing_time, elb_status_code, target_status_code, received_bytes, sent_bytes, request, user_agent, ssl_cipher, ssl_protocol, target_group_arn, trace_id
```

The log format is described in [AWS Application Load Balancer Access Log Collection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html)
