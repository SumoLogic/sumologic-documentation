Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Elastic Load Balancer - Classic distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. The Sumo Logic App for Elastic Load Balancer - Classic ingests logs generated by this activity, providing greater visibility into events that, in turn, help you understand the overall health of your EC2 deployment. For example, you can use the Sumo Logic App to analyze raw Elastic Load Balancing data to investigate the availability of applications running behind Elastic Load Balancers. Or, by correlating Elastic Load Balancer data with other data sets, you can get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

Our new app install flow is now in Beta. It is only enabled for certain customers while we gather Beta customer feedback. If you can see the Add Integration button, follow the "Before you begin" section in the "Collect Logs" help page and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app.
For information on collecting unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic, see AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM - Classic.

If you are just beginning with AWS ELB, for background see the Sumo Logic DevOps blog, "AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Load Balancer Best Practices."

## Collect Logs



## Installing the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS ELB, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Classic to use the preconfigured searches and [dashboards](https://help.sumologic.com/07Sumo-Logic-Apps/01Amazon_and_AWS/AWS_Elastic_Load_Balancing_-_Classic/AWS-Elastic-Load-Balancer---Classic-App-Dashboards#Dashboards) to analyze your data.

**To install the app:**

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**.

Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see the [Install the Apps from the Library.](https://help.sumologic.com/01Start-Here/Library/Apps-in-Sumo-Logic/Install-Apps-from-the-Library)


1. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (_sourceCategory=MyCategory). 
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
2. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.

Our new app install flow is now in Beta. It is only enabled for certain customers while we gather Beta customer feedback. If you can see the Add Integration button, follow the "Before you begin" section in the "Collect Logs" help page and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app.


### What if data isn't displaying in all Panels?

Amazon S3 buckets are scanned for new files according to the Scan Interval you set when configuring the S3 Source used for AWS Elastic Load Balancing logs. Even if you set a shorter Scan Interval, say five minutes, if no new files are found, the Scan Interval is automatically doubled, up to 24 hours (you can read more in [Set the S3 Source Scan Interval](https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/Amazon-Web-Services/AWS-S3-Scan-Interval-for-Sources)). If the Scan Interval increases, it means that a Panel set to a 60-minute time range may not find any data to display, because no files have uploaded to Sumo Logic. This isn't to say that no data is being collected from your S3 bucket; you can confirm that data is being collected on the Status page.

Additionally, you can change the time range of a Panel. Even though these Panels have been preconfigured, they can be edited just like any other Panel. You'll find instructions in Changing the time range of a Panel.


## Viewing the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic Dashboards

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancing helps you monitor the overall health of your ELB deployment. Dashboards keep an eye on errors being generated by back-end applications as well as errors generated from ELB instances.


### Overview

Track your Elastic Load Balancer activity at a glance to identify areas for further investigation such as requests by geolocation, browsers most frequently used, requests by protocol and cipher, which load balancers make the most requests, data sent and received, status codes, response times, and latencies.

* **Requests by Geolocation.** Uses a geolocation query to display a map of the IP addresses used by clients accessing your apps for the last three hours.
* **Browsers and Operating Systems.** See requests by browser used, broken down by  operating system for the last three hours.
* **Requests by SSL Protocol and Cipher. **See which version of TSL or SSL is being used by requests, broken down by which cryptographic cipher was used for the last three hours.
* **Requests by Load Balancer.** See how many requests are hitting a load balancer for the last three hours.
* **Data Sent and Received in MB. **Compare the data being sent and received by client IP in a bar chart for the last three hours.
* **4XX and 5XX Status Codes by Backend Instance and ELB.** Charts the number of 4XX and 5XX status codes for each backend instance and ELB in a bar chart over the last 24 hours.
* **Average Req and Resp Processing Time by ELB.** Compare the request and response time for each ELB for the last three hours.
* **Latency by Load Balancer.** See the latency of each load balancer in AWS in a stacked column chart for the last three hours.
