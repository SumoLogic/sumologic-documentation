The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancer - Classic distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. The Sumo Logic App for Elastic Load Balancer - Classic ingests logs generated by this activity, providing greater visibility into events that, in turn, help you understand the overall health of your EC2 deployment.

For example, you can use the Sumo Logic App to analyze raw Elastic Load Balancing data to investigate the availability of applications running behind Elastic Load Balancers. Or, by correlating Elastic Load Balancer data with other data sets, you can get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

If you are just beginning with AWS ELB, for background see the Sumo Logic DevOps blog, ["AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Load Balancer Best Practices"](https://www.sumologic.com/blog-devops/aws-elastic-load-balancer-best-practices/).

## Log Types

ELB logs are stored as .log files in the buckets you specify when you enable logging.

The process to enable collection for these logs is described in [AWS ELB Enable Access Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html).

The logs themselves contain these fields in this order:
```
datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, \
backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, \
ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, \
protocol, domain, server_port, path
```
The log format is described in [AWS ELB Access Log Collection](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html). For information on unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic, see [AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM - Classic](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Classic-Load-Balancer).

## Prerequisites

Follow the [Before you begin](#Before-you-begin) section and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app. For information on collecting unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic, see [AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM - Classic](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/classic-load-balancer.md).


### Before you begin

Enable Elastic Load Balancing logging in your AWS account and configure a Sumo Logic ELB Source, using [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-elastic-load-balancing-source).

If you have more than one environment that generates Elastic Load Balancing data (such as ops, dev, and so on), you’ll need to configure a separate S3 Source for each environment. This means that you’ll have the three App Dashboards for each environment. To avoid confusion, and in order to identify which environment is generating data, you should name each S3 Source with the environment's name. For example, you might name Sources as ELB-prod, ELB-dev, ELB-test, and so on.

Finally, make copies of each Panel in the Elastic Load Balancing Dashboards, and modify the search logic in each Panel so that you select the appropriate source for each environment. For example, for a production environment, you will add the string `_source=ELB-production` to the beginning of each search. If you have three environments then you will have three copies of the application for each of them (nine dashboards in total).


## Collecting Logs for the AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic App

This procedure shows how to enable access to your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logs and ingest them into Sumo Logic.

:::note
Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page in Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.

### Configure a Collector

Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Configure an ELB Source

{@import ../../reuse/apps/create-aws-s3-source.md} 

### Field Extraction Rules

For Field Extraction Rules, use the source category established earlier.

```bash title="AWS Elastic Load Balancing Logs"
parse "* * *:* *:* * * * * * * * \"* *://*:*/* HTTP" as datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, protocol, domain, server_port, path
```


### Sample Log Message

```json
2017-01-20T23:00:26.059475Z elb-shop-com 10.15.120.181:80 10.34.7.122:80 0.000026
0.315185 0.000027 200 200 51 1230 "POST https://examplesite.com:443/Common/path HTTP/1.1"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Safari; Touch) AppleWebKit/537.35+ (HTML, like Gecko) Version/10.3.2.2239

```

### Sample Query

```sql title="Name - Request by Geolocation"
_sourceCategory=elb*
| parse "* * *:* *:* * * * * * * * \"* *://*:*/* HTTP" as f1, elb_server, clientIP, port, backend, backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, protocol, domain, server_port, path nodrop
| parse "* * *:* *:* * * * * * * * \"-" as f1,elb_server,clientIP,port,backend,backend_port,requestProc,ba_Response,cli_Response,ELB_StatusCode,be_StatusCode,rcvd,send
| lookup latitude, longitude, country_code, country_name, region, city, postal_code, area_code, metro_code from geo://default on ip = clientIP
| count by latitude, longitude, country_code, country_name, region, city, postal_code, area_code, metro_code
| sort _count
```

## Installing the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS ELB, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Classic to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards to analyze your data.

{@import ../../reuse/apps/app-install.md}

<details><summary>What if data isn't displaying in all Panels?</summary>

Amazon S3 buckets are scanned for new files according to the Scan Interval you set when configuring the S3 Source used for AWS Elastic Load Balancing logs. Even if you set a shorter Scan Interval, say five minutes, if no new files are found, the Scan Interval is automatically doubled, up to 24 hours (you can read more in [Set the S3 Source Scan Interval](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-scan-interval-sources)). If the Scan Interval increases, it means that a Panel set to a 60-minute time range may not find any data to display, because no files have uploaded to Sumo Logic. This isn't to say that no data is being collected from your S3 bucket; you can confirm that data is being collected on the Status page.

Additionally, you can change the time range of a Panel. Even though these Panels have been preconfigured, they can be edited just like any other Panel. You'll find instructions in Changing the time range of a Panel.

## Viewing the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic Dashboards

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancing helps you monitor the overall health of your ELB deployment. Dashboards keep an eye on errors being generated by back-end applications as well as errors generated from ELB instances.
