The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancer - Classic distributes incoming application traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. The Sumo Logic App for Elastic Load Balancer - Classic ingests logs generated by this activity, providing greater visibility into events that, in turn, help you understand the overall health of your EC2 deployment.

For example, you can use the Sumo Logic App to analyze raw Elastic Load Balancing data to investigate the availability of applications running behind Elastic Load Balancers. Or, by correlating Elastic Load Balancer data with other data sets, you can get a broader understanding of the fault tolerance of your applications across multiple AWS Availability Zones.

If you are just beginning with AWS ELB, for background see the Sumo Logic DevOps blog, ["AWS Elastic Load Balancing: Load Balancer Best Practices"](https://www.sumologic.com/blog-devops/aws-elastic-load-balancer-best-practices/).

## Log Types

ELB logs are stored as .log files in the buckets you specify when you enable logging.

The process to enable collection for these logs is described in [AWS ELB Enable Access Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/enable-access-logs.html).

The logs themselves contain these fields in this order:
```
datetime, ELB_Server, clientIP, port, backend, \
backend_port, requestProc, ba_Response, cli_Response, \
ELB_StatusCode, be_StatusCode, rcvd, send, method, \
protocol, domain, server_port, path
```
The log format is described in [AWS ELB Access Log Collection](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/access-log-collection.html). For information on unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic, see [AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM - Classic](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Classic-Load-Balancer).

## Prerequisites

Follow the [Before you begin](#Before-you-begin) section and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app. For information on collecting unified logs and metrics for AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic, see [AWS Elastic Load Balancing ULM - Classic](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/classic-load-balancer.md).


### Before you begin

Enable Elastic Load Balancing logging in your AWS account and configure a Sumo Logic ELB Source, using [these instructions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-elastic-load-balancing-source).

If you have more than one environment that generates Elastic Load Balancing data (such as ops, dev, and so on), you’ll need to configure a separate S3 Source for each environment. This means that you’ll have the three App Dashboards for each environment. To avoid confusion, and in order to identify which environment is generating data, you should name each S3 Source with the environment's name. For example, you might name Sources as ELB-prod, ELB-dev, ELB-test, and so on.

Finally, make copies of each Panel in the Elastic Load Balancing Dashboards, and modify the search logic in each Panel so that you select the appropriate source for each environment. For example, for a production environment, you will add the string `_source=ELB-production` to the beginning of each search. If you have three environments then you will have three copies of the application for each of them (nine dashboards in total).


## Collecting Logs for the AWS Elastic Load Balancing - Classic App

This procedure shows how to enable access to your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) logs and ingest them into Sumo Logic.

:::note
Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page in Sumo Logic to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.
:::


### Configure a Collector

Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).


### Configure an ELB Source

When you create an AWS Source, you associate it with a Hosted Collector. Before creating the Source, identify the Hosted Collector you want to use, or create a new Hosted Collector. For instructions, see [Configure a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).

#### Rules

* If you're editing the `Collection should begin` date on a Source, the new date must be after the current `Collection should begin` date.
* Sumo Logic supports log files (S3 objects) that do NOT change after they are uploaded to S3. Support is not provided if your logging approach relies on updating files stored in an S3 bucket. S3 does not have a concept of updating existing files, you can only overwrite an existing file. When this overwrite happens, S3 considers it as a new file object, or a new version of the file, and that file object gets its own unique version ID.

  Sumo Logic scans an S3 bucket based on the path expression supplied, or receives an SNS notification when a new file object is created. As part of this, we receive a file name (key) and the object's ID. It's compared against a list of file objects already ingested. If a matching file ID is not found the contents of the file are ingested in full.

  When you overwrite a file in S3, the file object gets a new version ID and as a result, Sumo Logic sees it as a new file and ingests all of it. If with each version you post to S3 you are simply adding to the end of the file, then this will lead to duplicate messages ingested, one message for each version of the file you created in S3.
* Glacier objects will not be collected and are ignored.
* If you're using SNS you need to create a separate topic and subscription for each Source.


#### S3 Event Notifications Integration

Sumo’s S3 integration combines scan-based discovery and event based discovery into a unified integration that gives you the ability to maintain a low-latency integration for new content and provide assurances that no data was missed or dropped. When you enable event based notifications S3 will automatically publish new files to Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics which Sumo Logic can be subscribed. This notifies Sumo Logic immediately when new files are added to your S3 bucket so we can collect it. For more information about SNS, see the [Amazon SNS product](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) detail page.

Enabling event based notifications is an S3 bucket-level operation that subscribes to an SNS topic. An SNS topic is an access point that Sumo Logic can dynamically subscribe to in order to receive event notifications. When creating a Source that collects from an S3 bucket Sumo assigns an endpoint URL to the Source. The URL is for you to use in the AWS subscription to the SNS topic so AWS notifies Sumo when there are new files. See [Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) for more information.

You can adjust the configuration of when and how AWS handles communication attempts with Sumo Logic. See [Setting Amazon SNS Delivery Retry Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/DeliveryPolicies.html) for details.


#### Create an AWS Source

These configuration instructions apply to log collection from all AWS Source types. Select the correct Source type for your Source in Step 3.

1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**.
2. On the **Collectors** page, click **Add Source** next to a Hosted** **Collector, either an existing Hosted Collector, or one you have created for this purpose.
3. Select your AWS Source type.
4. Enter a name for the new Source. A description is optional.
5. Select an **S3 region** or keep the default value of **Others**. The S3 region must match the appropriate S3 bucket created in your Amazon account.

Selecting an AWS GovCloud region means your data will be leaving a FedRAMP-high environment. Use responsibly to avoid information spillage. See [Collection from AWS GovCloud](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/collection-aws-govcloud) for details.
6. For **Bucket Name**, enter the exact name of your organization's S3 bucket. Be sure to double-check the name as it appears in AWS, for example:

7. For **Path Expression**, enter the wildcard pattern that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use **one **wildcard (*) in this string. Recursive path expressions use a single wildcard and do **NOT** use a leading forward slash. [See About Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions) for details.
8. **Collection should begin.** Choose or enter how far back you'd like to begin collecting historical logs. You can either:
    * Choose a predefined value from dropdown list, ranging from "Now" to “72 hours ago” to “All Time”, or
    * Enter a relative value. To enter a relative value, click the **Collection should begin** field and press the delete key on your keyboard to clear the field. Then, enter a relative time expression, for example `-1w`. You can define when you want collection to begin in terms of months (M), weeks (w), days (d), hours (h), and minutes (m).

If you paused the Source and want to skip some data when you resume, update the **Collection should begin** setting to a time after it was paused.
9. For **Source Category**, enter any string to tag the output collected from this Source. (Category metadata is stored in a searchable field called _sourceCategory.)
10. **Fields**. Click the **+Add Field** link to add custom log metadata [Fields](/docs/manage/fields.md).
    * Define the fields you want to associate, each field needs a name (key) and value.

* ![green check circle.png](/img/reuse/green-check-circle.png) A green circle with a check mark is shown when the field exists and is enabled in the Fields table schema.
* ![orange exclamation point.png](/img/reuse/orange-exclamation-point.png) An orange triangle with an exclamation point is shown when the field doesn't exist, or is disabled, in the Fields table schema. In this case, an option to automatically add or enable the nonexistent fields to the Fields table schema is provided. If a field is sent to Sumo that does not exist in the Fields schema or is disabled it is ignored, known as dropped.
11. For **AWS Access** you have two **Access Method** options. Select **Role-based access** or **Key access** based on the AWS authentication you are providing. Role-based access is preferred, this was completed in the prerequisite step [Grant Sumo Logic access to an AWS Product](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).
    * For **Role-based access** enter** **the Role ARN that was provided by AWS after creating the role.  
    * For **Key access** enter the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key.** See [AWS Access Key ID](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/UsingSTS/UsingTokens.html#RequestWithSTS) and [AWS Secret Access Key](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for details.
12. **Log File Discovery.** You have the option to set up Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to notify Sumo Logic of new items in your S3 bucket. A scan interval is required and automatically applied to detect log files.

Sumo Logic highly recommends using an SNS Subscription Endpoint for its ability to maintain low-latency collection. This is essential to support up-to-date [Alerts](/docs/alerts).
    * **Scan Interval.** Sumo Logic will periodically scan your S3 bucket for new items in addition to SNS notifications. **Automatic** is recommended to not incur additional AWS charges. This sets the scan interval based on if subscribed to an SNS topic endpoint and how often new files are detected over time.
If the Source is not subscribed to an SNS topic and set to **Automatic** the scan interval is 5 minutes. You may enter a set frequency to scan your S3 bucket for new data. To learn more about Scan Interval considerations, see [About setting the S3 Scan Interval](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-scan-interval-sources).
    * **SNS Subscription Endpoint **(**Highly Recommended**). New files will be collected by Sumo Logic as soon as the notification is received. This will provide faster collection versus having to wait for the next scan to detect the new file.
        3. To set up the subscription you need to get an endpoint URL from Sumo to provide to AWS. This process will save your Source and begin scanning your S3 bucket when the endpoint URL is generated. Click on **Create URL** and use the provided endpoint URL when creating your subscription in step C.



#### Set up SNS in AWS (Highly Recommended)

The following steps use the Amazon SNS Console. You may instead use AWS CloudFormation. Follow the instructions to use [CloudFormation to set up an SNS Subscription Endpoint](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/configure-your-aws-source-cloudformation#set-up-an-sns-subscription-endpoint).

1. Go to **Services >** **Simple Notification Service** and click **Create Topic**. Enter a **Topic name** and click **Create topic**. Copy the provided **Topic ARN**, you’ll need this for the next step.
Make sure that the topic and the bucket are in the same region.
2. Again go to **Services >** **Simple Notification Service** and click **Create Subscription**. Paste the **Topic ARN** from step B above. Select **HTTPS** as the protocol and enter the **Endpoint** URL provided while creating the S3 source in Sumo Logic. Click **Create subscription** and a confirmation request will be sent to Sumo Logic. The request will be automatically confirmed by Sumo Logic.
3. Select the **Topic** created in step B and navigate to **Actions > Edit Topic Policy**. Use the following policy template, replace the `SNS-topic-ARN` and `bucket-name` placeholders in the `Resource` section of the JSON policy with your actual SNS topic ARN and S3 bucket name:
```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [{
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "AWS": "*"
        },
        "Action": [
            "SNS:Publish"
        ],
        "Resource": "SNS-topic-ARN",
        "Condition": {
            "ArnLike": {
                "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:bucket-name"
            }
        }
    }]
}
```
4. Go to **Services > [S3](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/)** and select the bucket to which you want to attach the notifications. Navigate to **Properties > Events > Add Notification**. Enter a **Name** for the event notification. In the **Events** section select **All object create events**. In the **Send to** section (notification destination) select **SNS Topic**. An **SNS** section becomes available, select the name of the topic you created in step B from the dropdown. Click **Save**.


#### Complete setup in Sumo

1. Set any of the following under **Advanced**:
* **Enable Timestamp Parsing.** This option is selected by default. If it's deselected, no timestamp information is parsed at all.
    * **Time Zone.** There are two options for Time Zone. You can use the time zone present in your log files, and then choose an option in case time zone information is missing from a log message. Or, you can have Sumo Logic completely disregard any time zone information present in logs by forcing a time zone. It's very important to have the proper time zone set, no matter which option you choose. If the time zone of logs can't be determined, Sumo Logic assigns logs UTC; if the rest of your logs are from another time zone your search results will be affected.
    * **Timestamp Format.** By default, Sumo Logic will automatically detect the timestamp format of your logs. However, you can manually specify a timestamp format for a Source. See [Timestamps, Time Zones, Time Ranges, and Date Formats](/docs/send-data/reference-information/time-reference) for more information.
* **Enable Multiline Processing. **See [Collecting Multiline Logs](/docs/send-data/reference-information/collect-multiline-logs) for details on multiline processing and its options. This is enabled by default. Use this option if you're working with multiline messages (for example, log4J or exception stack traces). Deselect this option if you want to avoid unnecessary processing when collecting single-message-per-line files (for example, Linux system.log). Choose one of the following:  
    * **Infer Boundaries.** Enable when you want Sumo Logic to automatically attempt to determine which lines belong to the same message. If you deselect the Infer Boundaries option, you will need to enter a regular expression in the Boundary Regex field to use for detecting the entire first line of multiline messages.
    * **Boundary Regex.** You can specify the boundary between messages using a regular expression. Enter a regular expression that matches the entire first line of every multiline message in your log files.
1. [Create any Processing Rules](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules/create-processing-rule.md) you'd like for the AWS Source.
2. When you are finished configuring the Source, click **Save**.


#### SNS with one bucket and multiple Sources

When collecting from one Amazon S3 bucket with multiple Sumo Sources, you need to create a separate topic and subscription for each Source. Subscriptions and Sumo Sources should both map to only one endpoint. If you were to have multiple subscriptions Sumo would collect your objects multiple times.

Each topic needs a separate filter (prefix/suffix) so that collection does not overlap. For example, the following image shows a bucket configured with two notifications that have filters (prefix/suffix) set to notify Sumo separately about new objects in different folders.


#### Update Source to use S3 Event Notifications

There is a [community supported script](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-content/tree/master/Sumo-Logic-Tools/Event_Based_S3_Automation) available that configures event based object discovery on existing AWS Sources.

1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**.
2. On the Collection page navigate to your Source and click **Edit**. Scroll down to **Log File Discovery** and note the Endpoint **URL** provided, you will use this in step 10.C when creating your subscription.
3. Complete steps 10.B through 10.E for [configuring SNS Notifications](#Configure-SNS-Notifications).


#### Troubleshoot S3 Event Notifications

In the web interface under **Log File Discovery** it shows a red exclamation mark with "Sumo Logic has not received a validation request from AWS".

Steps to troubleshoot:

1. Refresh the Source’s page to view the latest status of the subscription in the SNS Subscription section by clicking **Cancel** then **Edit** on the Source in the Collection tab.
2. Verify you have enabled sending **Notifications** from your S3 bucket to the appropriate SNS topic. This is done in [step 10.E](#Configure-SNS-Notifications).
3. If you didn’t use CloudFormation check that the SNS topic has a confirmed subscription to the URL in AWS console. A "Pending Confirmation" state likely means that you entered the wrong URL while creating the subscription.

In the web interface under **Log File Discovery** it shows a green check with "Sumo Logic has received an AWS validation request at this endpoint." but you still have high latencies.

The green check confirms that the endpoint was used correctly, but it does not mean Sumo is receiving notifications successfully.

Steps to troubleshoot:

1. AWS writes CloudTrail and S3 Audit Logs to S3 with a latency of a few minutes. If you’re seeing latencies of around 10 minutes for these Sources it is likely because AWS is writing them to S3 later than expected.
2. Verify you have enabled sending **Notifications** from your S3 bucket to the appropriate SNS topic. This is done in [step 10](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Elastic-Load-Balancing-Classic#Configure-SNS-Notifications).


### Field Extraction Rules

For Field Extraction Rules, use the source category established earlier.

```

## Installing the AWS Elastic Load Balancer Classic App

Now that you have set up collection for AWS ELB, install the Sumo Logic App for AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Classic to use the preconfigured searches and dashboards to analyze your data.

{@import ../../reuse/apps/app-install.md}

<details><summary>What if data isn't displaying in all Panels?</summary>

Amazon S3 buckets are scanned for new files according to the Scan Interval you set when configuring the S3 Source used for AWS Elastic Load Balancing logs. Even if you set a shorter Scan Interval, say five minutes, if no new files are found, the Scan Interval is automatically doubled, up to 24 hours (you can read more in [Set the S3 Source Scan Interval](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-scan-interval-sources)). If the Scan Interval increases, it means that a Panel set to a 60-minute time range may not find any data to display, because no files have uploaded to Sumo Logic. This isn't to say that no data is being collected from your S3 bucket; you can confirm that data is being collected on the Status page.

Additionally, you can change the time range of a Panel. Even though these Panels have been preconfigured, they can be edited just like any other Panel. You'll find instructions in Changing the time range of a Panel.
