AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

The Sumo Logic App for AWS WAF analyzes traffic flowing through AWS WAF and automatically detects threats using Sumo Logic Threat Intel. The App provides pre-configured dashboards and searches that allow you to monitor threat and traffic details by client IP,  allowed and blocked traffic, malicious IPs, threat actors, location, rules configured, trends and more.

Our new app install flow is now in Beta. It is only enabled for certain customers while we gather Beta customer feedback. If you can see the Add Integration button, follow the "Before you begin" section in the "Collect Logs" help page and then use the in-product instructions in Sumo Logic to set up the app.
