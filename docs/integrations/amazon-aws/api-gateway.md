AWS API Gateway service allows you to create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs for real-time two-way communication applications in containerized and serverless environments, as well as web applications.

The Sumo Logic AWS API Gateway app provides insights into API Gateway tasks while accepting and processing concurrent API calls throughout your infrastructure, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management.

## Log and metrics types  

The AWS API Gateway app uses the following logs and metrics:

* [Amazon API Gateway metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-metrics-and-dimensions.html) <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/OOjs_UI_icon_external-link-ltr-progressive.svg' alt="Thumbnail icon" width="12"/>
* [CloudTrail API Gateway Data Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/cloudtrail.html) <br/><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/OOjs_UI_icon_external-link-ltr-progressive.svg' alt="Thumbnail icon" width="12"/>

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for AWS API Gateway

### Collect Metrics for AWS API Gateway   

Sumo Logic supports collecting metrics using two source types:
* Configure an [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source) (**recommended**); or
* Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics)

:::note
Namespace for **AWS API Gateway** Service is **AWS/ApiGateway**.
:::

For **Metadata**, add an **account** field to the source and assign it a value that is a friendly name/alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting metrics. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Metrics can be queried via the “account field”.


### Collect AWS API Gateway CloudTrail Logs

To your Hosted Collector, add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source.md):
1. **Name**. Enter a name to display the new Source.
2. **Description**. Enter an optional description.
3. **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your **API Gateway** S3 bucket.
4. **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your **API Gateway** S3 bucket.
5. **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (`*`) in this string.
  :::note NOTES
  DO NOT use a leading forward slash. See [Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions). The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Don’t include the S3 bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
  :::
6. **Source Category**. Enter `aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs`.
7. **Fields**. Add an **account** field and assign it a value that is a friendly name/alias to your AWS account from which you are collecting logs. This name will appear in the Sumo Logic Explorer View. Logs can be queried via the “account field”.
8. **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSGettingStartedGuide/AWSCredentials.html). Learn how to use Role-based access to AWS [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources)
9. **Log File Discovery -> Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes. Alternately, enter the frequency. Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data. Learn how to configure **Log File Discovery** [here](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-sources).
10. **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select the **Extract timestamp information from log file entries** check box.
11. **Time Zone**. Select **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and select **UTC** from the dropdown.
12. **Timestamp Format.** Select **Automatically detect the format**.
13. **Enable Multiline Processing**. Select the **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** check box, and select **Infer Boundaries**.

### Field in Field Schema

Login to Sumo Logic, go to **Manage Data** > **Logs** > **Fields**. Search for the **apiname** field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields.md#manage-fields).


### Field Extraction Rule(s)

Create Field Extraction Rule for CloudTrail Logs. Learn how to create Field Extraction Rule [here](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule).
```sql
Rule Name: AwsObservabilityApiGatewayCloudTrailLogsFER
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data):
account=* eventname eventsource "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
Parse Expression:
| json "eventSource", "awsRegion", "responseElements", "recipientAccountId" as eventSource, region, responseElements, accountid nodrop
| where eventSource = "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
| "aws/apigateway" as namespace
| json field=responseElements "name" as ApiName nodrop
| tolowercase(ApiName) as apiname
| fields region, namespace, apiname, accountid
```

### Centralized AWS CloudTrail log Collection

In case you have a centralized collection of CloudTraillogs and are ingesting them from all accounts into a single Sumo Logic CloudTraillog source, create following Field Extraction Rule to map proper AWS account(s) friendly name/alias. You'll need to create it if not already present or update it as required.
```sql
Rule Name: AWS Accounts
Applied at: Ingest Time
Scope (Specific Data):
_sourceCategory=aws/observability/cloudtrail/logs
```

#### Parse Expression

Enter a parse expression to create an `account` field that maps to the alias you set for each sub account. For example, if you used the `“dev”` alias for an AWS account with ID `"528560886094"` and the `“prod”` alias for an AWS account with ID `"567680881046"`, your parse expression would look like this:

```sql
| json "recipientAccountId"
// Manually map your aws account id with the AWS account alias you setup earlier for individual child account
| "" as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "528560886094",  "dev", account) as account
| if (recipientAccountId = "567680881046",  "prod", account) as account
| fields account
```

## Installing the AWS API Gateway app

Now that you have set up a collection for the **AWS API gateway**, install the Sumo Logic app to use the pre-configured dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

### Enhanced Monitoring
The **AWS API Gateway - Enhanced Monitoring** dashboard provides detailed insights into API Gateway performance throughout your infrastructure, including the number and types of API calls, API resources, cache hits, and misses, latency averages, and errors by HTTP method.

For your API Gateway instance to send enhanced metrics, you must have explicitly enabled detailed CloudWatch metrics. You can do this in the AWS management console under a Stage settings tab by selecting Enable CloudWatch Metrics. Alternatively, you can call the update-stage AWS CLI command to update the metrics enabled property to True.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor API Gateways across your infrastructure using enhanced metrics.
* Monitor API requests trend by resource, HTTP method, and deployment stage.
* Monitor API cache hits and misses to optimize cache capacities to achieve desired performance.
* Monitor the overall responsiveness of API calls and the backend origin servers
* Monitor the total number of client-side and server-side errors based on HTTP methods
