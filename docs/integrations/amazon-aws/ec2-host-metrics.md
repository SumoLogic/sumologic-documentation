Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

The Sumo Logic App for Host Metrics (EC2) allows you to collect your EC2 instance metrics and display them using predefined dashboards. The App provides dashboards to display analysis of EC2 instance metrics for CPU, memory, disk, network, and TCP. Also, it provides detailed insights into all cloudtrail audit events associated with EC2 instances and specifically helps identify changes, errors, and user activities.


## Metrics Types  

Host metrics are gathered by the open-source [SIGAR library](https://github.com/hyperic/sigar). The metrics that are collected are described in [Host Metrics for Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Host-Metrics-Source#Collected_Metrics).

* [CPU Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics#CPU-Metrics)
* [Memory Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics#Memory-Metrics)
* [TCP Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics#TCP-Metrics)
* [Networking Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics#networking-metrics)
* [Disk Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics#disk-metrics)


### Sample Query  

```sql title="Average CPU Utilization"
_sourcecategory=Labs/AWS/Host/Metrics metric=CPU_Total account=* region=* namespace=aws/ec2 instanceid=* | avg
```


## Collecting Metrics for the Host Metrics (EC2) App

The Host Metrics (EC2) app relies upon an Installed Collector with a [Host Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Host-Metrics-Source) on each of your AWS EC2 hosts. This page describes the data sources for the Host Metrics (EC2) app and has instructions for setting up metric collection.


### Field in Field Schema

Log in to Sumo Logic, go to Manage Data > Logs > Fields. Search for the `instanceid` field. If not present, create it. Learn how to create and manage fields [here](/docs/manage/fields#manage-fields).


### Configure Host Metrics sources  

Follow the instructions in this section to configure the Sumo Logic Installed Collector and a [Host Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Host-Metrics-Source) on each of your AWS EC2 hosts. You will assign account and Namespace metadata [fields](/docs/manage/fields) to the sources so that incoming logs and metrics will be appropriately tagged.

This step is not necessary if you already have an Installed Collector and Host Metrics tagged with account and Namespace metadata fields.

Perform these steps for each EC2 host.

1. Set up an Installed Collector. For instructions, see [Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/Installed-Collectors).
2. Add a Host Metrics Source to the Installed Collector. For instructions, see [Manually Configure a Host Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/Host-Metrics-Source#Manually-Configure-a-Host-Metrics-Source). In the **Fields** portion of the configuration::
   * Add a field named account, and set it to your AWS account alias.
   * Add a field named Namespace and set it to AWS/EC2.
3. Set the **Scan Interval** (the frequency at which the Source is scanned) to 1 minute.

A default Scan Interval of 1 minute is recommended. You can set it to a higher or lower interval as needed. Faster intervals may result in increased consumption cost.

You can also build your EC2 AMI machine image with these fields and settings. For instructions, see [this blog](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/packer-and-sumo-logic). Here’s a sample sources.json file that you can include in your AMI.


```json
{
  "api.version": "v1",
   "source": {
    "name": "Host Metrics",
    "category": "hostmetrics",
    "automaticDateParsing": false,
    "multilineProcessingEnabled": true,
    "useAutolineMatching": true,
    "contentType": "HostMetrics",
    "forceTimeZone": false,
    "filters": [],
    "cutoffTimestamp": 0,
    "encoding": "UTF-8",
    "fields": {
      "account": "<your AWS account alias>",
      "Namespace": "AWS/EC2"
    },

          "path": {
            "type": "NoPathExpression"
          },
          "authentication": {
            "type": "NoAuthentication"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "interval": 300000,
    "metrics": [
      "CPU_User",
      "CPU_Sys",
 …..
    ],
    "processMetrics": [],
    "sourceType": "SystemStats"
  }
}
```


### AWS Metadata

Collectors running on AWS EC2 instances can optionally collect AWS Metadata such as EC2 tags to make it easier to search for Host Metrics. Only one AWS Metadata Source for Metrics is required to collect EC2 tags from multiple hosts. For more information, see [AWS Metadata Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-metadata-tag-source).


# Install the Host Metrics (EC2) App

Now that you have set up the collection for Host Metrics (EC2) metrics, install the Sumo Logic App to use the pre-configured searches and [dashboards](#Dashboards) that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app**.**
2. To install the app, click **Add to Library** and complete the following fields.
    * **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    * **Advanced**. Select the **Location in the Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
3. Click **Add to Library**.

Once the app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or any other folder you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
