[Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/details/mysql-details/) is a MySQL is a relational database built for the cloud. The Sumo Logic app for Aurora MySQL ULM is a unified logs and metrics (ULM) app for your Aurora MySQL database. The app allows you to monitor slow queries executing on the database, the number of connections made, identify users and client hosts, and client locations used to connect to database. The app also provides insights for queries executed per second, CPU utilization, free memory, network utilization, volume read and write IOPS, replica lags, latency, throughput, failed login and  connection attempts, and other health and performance related data.

The Sumo Logic app for Aurora MySQL ULM includes predefined searches and dashboards that allow you to monitor logs and metrics for the database. The logs enable you to monitor database activity, user activity, incoming connections, query execution time, and errors. The metrics allow you to monitor database resource utilization and throughput performance.

This guide provides an overview of the Aurora MySQL ULM app pre-defined queries and dashboards, as well as instructions for collecting logs and metrics from Aurora MySQL, and installing the app.

## Collecting Logs and Metrics for the Aurora MySQL ULM app

The **Aurora MySQL ULM app** includes predefined searches and dashboards that allow you to monitor logs and metrics for your Aurora MySQL database. The logs enable you to monitor database activity, user activity, incoming connections, query execution time, and errors. The metrics allow you to monitor database resource utilization and throughput performance.

The Aurora MySQL ULM is used for monitoring your database with CloudTrail event logs, and CloudWatch logs and metrics. The logs enable you to monitor database activity, user activity, incoming connections, query execution time, and errors. Metrics allow you to monitor database resource utilization and throughput performance. CloudTrail events allow you to monitor the use of Aurora services and operations by users.

This section provides instructions for collecting logs and metrics for ingest into Sumo Logic, and consists of the following steps:

### Step 1: Plan your source categories

Before you configure log and metric sources for the Sumo Logic app for Aurora MySQL ULM, you must decide upon the source category to assign to each source.  Taking a hierarchical approach allows you to make use of wildcards when performing searches, as shown in the following examples:

* For the AWS CloudTrail source for CloudTrail Events, you could specify a source category of AWS/CloudTrail
* For the AWS CloudWatch Metric source to collect CloudWatch metrics, you could specify a source category of AWS/RDS/Metric.
* For the AWS CloudWatch Logs source to collect various Aurora MySQL CloudWatch logs (Error, SlowQuery, Audit and General), you could specify a source category of AWS/RDS/Aurora/MySQL/Error, AWS/RDS/Aurora/MySQL/SlowQuery, AWS/RDS/Aurora/MySQL/Audit, AWS/RDS/Aurora/MySQL/General

### Step 2: Collect AWS CloudTrail events using AWS CloudTrail source  

This section provides instructions for setting up AWS CloudTrail Source to collect events for ingest into Sumo Logic.

To collect AWS CloudTrail events, do the following:
1. Configure a [Hosted Collector.](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector)
2. Add an [AWS CloudTrail Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source) to the Hosted Collector, providing the following information:
   * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
   * **Description**.(Optional) Enter a description of the Source.
   * **S3 Region**. Select the Amazon Region for your CloudTrail Aurora S3 bucket.
   * **Bucket Name**. Enter the exact name of your CloudTrail Aurora S3 bucket.
   * **Path Expression**. Enter the string that matches the S3 objects you'd like to collect. You can use a wildcard (*) in this string. (DO NOT use a leading forward slash. See [Amazon Path Expressions](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-path-expressions).)The S3 bucket name is not part of the path. Don’t include the bucket name when you are setting the Path Expression.
   * **Source Category**. Enter a source category, for example, AWS/CloudTrail.
   * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon [Access Key ID and Secret Access Key](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html).
   * **Scan Interval**. Use the default of 5 minutes, or enter a time interval frequency at which Sumo Logic will scan your S3 bucket for new data.
   * **Enable Timestamp Parsing**. Select the **Extract timestamp information from log file entries** check box.
   * **Time Zone**. Select **Ignore time zone from the log file and instead use**, and select **UTC** from the dropdown.
   * **Timestamp Format.** Select **Automatically detect the format**.
   * **Enable Multiline Processing**. Select the **Detect messages spanning multiple lines** check box, and select **Infer Boundaries**.
3. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Collect AWS CloudWatch logs for Aurora MySQL (Error, SlowQuery, Audit, and General)

This section provides instructions for setting up the collection of AWS CloudWatch logs for ingest into Sumo Logic. To collect AWS CloudWatch logs, do the following:

1. Follow the instructions for collecting [Amazon CloudWatch logs](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/amazon-cloudwatch-logs). By default, Aurora MySQL Error Logs are enabled to be pushed to CloudWatch. However, you need to turn ON other log types, as explained in the following steps.
2. While configuring the log forwarding with Lambda function to Sumo Logic, set log format as **Others**.
3. Create a **DB Parameters Group**, if not done already.
4. Enable the following:
   * General log
   * Slow Query log: Set the `long_query_time parameter`, then enable `log_slow_admin_statement`s, `log_slow_slave_statements`, and `log_queries_not_using_indexes`.
5. Create a **DB Cluster Parameter Group**, if not done already.
6. Enable the following audit logs:
   * server_audit_logging
   * server_audit_logs_upload
7. Modify the cluster to specify the **Cluster Parameter group on cluster level** and the **Parameter Group on instance level**.
8. Reboot the instances to make the changes effective.

### Step 4: Collect Aurora CloudWatch metrics using AWS CloudWatch Metric Source

This section provides instructions setting up the collection of Aurora CloudWatch metrics using AWS CloudWatch Metric Source for ingest into Sumo Logic.

To collect Aurora CloudWatch metrics, do the following:
1. Configure a [Hosted Collector.](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector)
2. Configure an [Amazon CloudWatch Metrics Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics), providing the following information:
   * **Name**. Enter a name to display for the new Source.
   * **Description**. (Optional) Enter a description of the Source.
   * **Regions**. Select your Amazon Regions for Amazon RDS.
   * **Namespaces**. Select **AWS/RDS**.
   * **Source Category**. Enter a source category, for example, AWS/RDS/Metric.
   * **Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**. Enter your Amazon Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
   * **Scan Interval**. Accept the default of 5 minutes, or enter a time interval at which Sumo Logic will scan CloudWatch Sources for new data.
3. Click **Save**.
