[Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) is an intelligence threat detection service that provides accurate, continuous monitoring to protect AWS accounts and workloads. This page explains the log collection process, and provides instructions for configuring log collection and installing the Amazon GuardDuty Benchmark App.

The Sumo Logic **Amazon GuardDuty Benchmark App** integrates **Global Intelligence Service (GIS)** with Amazon GuardDuty for continuous machine learning and statistical baselines for KPIs (key performance indicators) and KRIs (key risk indicators). These baselines enable you to optimize security configuration and threat detection on all your AWS accounts.  

Global Intelligence baselines are computed by aggregating data for a given customer across all source categories defined for Amazon GuardDuty. As result, to enable meaningful comparisons, the app must be provided with all the source categories in your Sumo Logic account that are associated with Amazon GuardDuty. Follow the instructions on the [Custom Data Filters](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#custom-data-filters) page to set up your app with custom data filters, specifying multiple source categories for Amazon GuardDuty.

The App includes pre-configured dashboards and searches with visual displays for global threat baselines and real-time threat detection across your AWS environment, including threat sources and targets by geographic locations.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic App for GuardDuty requires the Amazon GuardDuty findings to be sent through the Amazon CloudWatch Events. For more details, see [GuardDuty findings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html).


## Configuring Log Collection and Deploying the App

:::note
If you have already Amazon GuardDuty data flowing into Sumo Logic, you can skip the steps in this section and [install the Amazon GuardDuty Benchmark App](#installing-the-amazon-guardduty-benchmark-app) from the Sumo Logic App Catalog.
:::

:::note
These tasks require the Manage Collectors and Manage Access Keys [role capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities).
:::

Sumo Logic provides a SAM application based on [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/serverless_app.html), and is published in the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/). This SAM deployment:
1. Creates a Lambda function and its associated components.
2. Creates collector, and HTTP Source at Sumo Logic.
3. Installs the Sumo Logic GuardDuty Benchmark App.

After completing this process, logs are ingested into Sumo Logic in the following way:

1. Amazon GuardDuty sends notifications based on CloudWatch events when new findings, or new occurrences of existing findings, are generated.
2. A CloudWatch events rule enables CloudWatch to send events for the GuardDuty findings to the Sumo CloudWatchEventFunction Lambda function.
3. The Lambda function sends the events to an HTTP source on a Sumo Logic hosted collector.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/AGD_BM_Collection_Overview.png')} alt="flow" />

This section shows you how to generate an access key and access ID for log collection, and then how to deploy the Amazon GuardDuty Benchmark App.


### Step 1: Generate an Access Key and Access ID

In this step, you need to generate access key and access ID from the Sumo Logic console.

To generate an access key and access ID, do the following:
1. Follow the instructions as described in this [Sumo Logic Access Key](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#Create_an_access_key)) document.
2. Copy down both the values as youâ€™ll need them to deploy the Sumo Logic GuardDuty Benchmark SAM App.


### Step 2: Deploy the Sumo Logic GuardDuty Benchmark SAM App

In this step, you deploy the SAM application, which creates the AWS resources described in the [process overview](#Process_overview).

To deploy the Sumo Logic GuardDuty Benchmark SAM App, do the following:

1. Go to [https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications).
2. Search for **sumologic-guardduty-benchmark** and click the app link when it appears.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/AGD_BM_Deploy_Benchmark_App_dialog.png')} alt="flow" />
3. When the page for the Sumo app appears, click **Deploy**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/AGD_BM_Deploy_App_dialog.png')} alt="flow" />
4. In **Configure application parameters** panel, enter the following parameters:
    * Access ID (Required): Sumo Logic Access ID generated from Step 1.
    * Access Key (Required): Sumo Logic Access Key generated from Step 1.
    * Deployment Name(Required): Deployment name (environment name in lower case as per [docs](/docs/api/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security)).
    * Collector Name: Enter the name of the Hosted Collector which will be created in Sumo Logic.
    * Source Name: Enter the name of the HTTP Source which will be created within the collector.
    * Source Category Name: Enter the name of the Source Category which will be used for writing search queries.
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. When the deployment is successful, click **View CloudFormation Stack**.
7. In the Outputs section, copy the app folder name to search your personal folder in the Sumo Logic console.
