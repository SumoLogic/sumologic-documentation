Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that provides an easy way for companies to distribute content to end-users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. The Sumo Logic app for Amazon CloudFront provides analytics on visitor information, rates and statistics, content being served, and other metrics. The app uses predefined searches and Dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real time analysis of overall usage.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic app for Amazon CloudFront uses logs from an Amazon S3 bucket. These logs will be generated by the Amazon CloudFront service. For setup details, refer to Collecting Logs for Amazon CloudFront.

## Collecting logs for the Amazon CloudFront app

### Prerequisites

Before you install the Amazon CloudFront app, complete the following tasks:

1. Enable [CloudFront logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html).
2. Confirm that access logs are being delivered to the Amazon S3 bucket.
3. [Grant Sumo Logic Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota, you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-legacy-account) at any time.

### Add an AWS Source

import Aws3 from '../../reuse/apps/create-aws-s3-source.md';

<Aws3/>

### Multiline Processing Boundary Regex Example

If your CloudFront log message is of this format:
```bash
2017-06-13    22:02:13    SYD1 ..............
```

You could use this Boundary Regex:
```bash
^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*
```

## Installing the Amazon CloudFront app

Now that you have set up collection for CloudFront, install the Sumo Logic app for Amazon CloudFront to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

## Uninstalling the Amazon CloudFront app (Optional)

import AppUninstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-uninstall.md';

<AppUninstall/>

## Additional logs and metrics collection (Optional)

### Log and metric types

* [CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html)
* [Real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html)
* CloudWatch Logs
  * [Edge Function Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-functions-logs.html)
* [CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging_using_cloudtrail.html)

### Configure metrics collection

* Collect **CloudWatch Metrics** with namespace [AWS/CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html) using [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-metrics-source/) source. For `AWS/CloudFront` metrics and dimensions, refer to [Amazon CloudFront CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/programming-cloudwatch-metrics.html).

### Configure logs collection

* Collect **real-time Logs** using the [Amazon S3](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-source/) source if you have real-time logs destination set to S3 bucket. With CloudFront [real-time logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/real-time-logs.html), you can get information about requests made to distribution in real-time (logs are delivered within seconds of receiving the requests). You can use real-time logs to monitor, analyze, and take action based on content delivery performance.
* Collect **Amazon CloudWatch Logs** using the [AWS Kinesis Firehose for Logs](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source/) source. You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to get logs for your [edge functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/edge-functions-logs.html), both Lambda@Edge and CloudFront Functions.
* Collect [AWS CloudTrail Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/logging_using_cloudtrail.html) using the [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-cloudtrail-source/) source. Amazon CloudFront is integrated with CloudTrail, an AWS service that captures information about every request sent to the CloudFront API by your AWS account, including your IAM users. CloudTrail periodically saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail captures information about all requests, whether they were made using the CloudFront console, the CloudFront API, the AWS SDKs, the CloudFront CLI, or another service, for example, AWS CloudFormation.
