Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that provides an easy way for companies to distribute content to end-users with low latency and high data transfer speeds. The Sumo Logic App for Amazon CloudFront provides analytics on visitor information, rates and statistics, content being served, and other metrics. The app uses predefined searches and Dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real time analysis of overall usage.

## Log Types

The Sumo Logic App for Amazon CloudFront uses logs from an Amazon S3 bucket. These logs will be generated by the Amazon CloudFront service. For setup details, refer to Collecting Logs for Amazon CloudFront.

## Collecting Logs for the Amazon CloudFront App

### Before you begin

Before you install the Amazon CloudFront App, complete the following tasks:

1. Enable [CloudFront logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html).
2. Confirm that logs are being delivered to the Amazon S3 bucket.
3. [Grant Sumo Logic Access to the Amazon S3 Bucket](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/grant-access-aws-product).

Once you begin uploading data, your daily data usage will increase. It's a good idea to check the **Account** page to make sure that you have enough quota to accommodate additional data in your account. If you need additional quota, you can [upgrade your account](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/upgrade-cloud-flex-account.md) at any time.


### Add an AWS Source

{@import ../../reuse/apps/create-aws-s3-source.md}

### Multiline Processing Boundary Regex Example

If your CloudFront log message is of this format:
```bash
2017-06-13    22:02:13    SYD1 ..............
```

You could use this Boundary Regex:
```bash
^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\s+\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}.*
```



## Installing the Amazon CloudFront App

Now that you have set up collection for CloudFront, install the Sumo Logic App for Amazon CloudFront to use the pre-configured searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.
