The Opsgenie App provides at-a-glance views and detailed analytics for alerts on your DevOps environment, allowing you to effectively monitor and gain valuable insights into your incidents and incident handling operations.

Opsgenie is an incident management platform for operating services that are on 24/7. Opsgenie allows you to plan for service disruptions and stay in control during incidents. Opsgenie centralizes alerts and reliably notifies the correct contacts to ensure timely analysis and efficient action.

For more information, see the [Opsgenie Alerts and Alert Fields](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/alerts-and-alert-fields) documentation.

## Log Types

Sumo Logic - Opsgenie integration supports the following Alert types:
* Create
* AddRecipient
* Acknowledge
* AddNote
* UnAcknowledge
* EscalateToNext
* Escalate
* Close


### Sample Log Message

Different Alert types used by Opsgenie, with sample payloads, are defined here: [https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/sample-alert-action-data](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/sample-alert-action-data)


### Sample Query

The following query sample is taken from the **Alerts by Priority Over Time** panel on the **Opsgenie - Alerts Breakdown Dashboard**:


```sql
_sourceCategory="opsgenie/events" Create
| json "alert.createdAt", "alert.description", "alert.message", "action", "alert.team",  
"alert.priority", "alert.source" , "alert.tags[*]","alert.recipients[*]" as created_at,
description, message, action, team, priority, source, tags, recipients nodrop
| where action = "Create"
| timeslice 1h
| count by _timeslice, priority
| transpose row _timeslice column priority
```


## Collecting Logs for Opsgenie

The Sumo Logic Opsgenie App is designed to effectively monitor Opsgenie alerts, team performances, detect any outliers, and track the team's Mean time to repair (MTTR) incidents. With Sumo Logic dashboards you can easily identify:

* Alerts by Type Over Time
* Alerts Created - Outlier
* Alerts Escalated - Outlier
* Alerts Breakdown by Team/Priority/Users/Sources/Tags
* Alerts Created/Closed/Escalated/Acknowledged/Escalated to Next
* Alerts - One Day Time Comparison
* Alerts MTTR with additional details


### Configuring collection

This section explains the log collection process, and then walks you through the steps for configuring log collection for the Sumo Logic App for Opsgenie.

There are two methods for integrating Opsgenie with Sumo Logic:
* When an action happens at Opsgenie alerts, the webhook data is forwarded to the Sumo Logic and the data appears in the Opsgenie App. This integration method are described in this section.
* Sumo Logic sends webhook alerts to Opsgenie which acts as a dispatcher for these alerts and determines the right people to notify based on on-call schedules, and notifies them via email, text messages (SMS), phone calls, and iPhone & Android push notifications, and escalates alerts until the alert is acknowledged or closed. This data is not utilized by the Opsgenie App, but you can configure this integration by following the instructions provided in [this Set Up Webhook Connections document](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections). Opsgenie Alerts are defined at the Team level, so you need to create an Opsgenie - Sumo Logic Webhook integrations for each team.

To configure log collection for the Opsgenie App, do the following:

1. Configure a [Sumo Logic HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics), an endpoint for receiving log and metric data uploaded to a unique URL generated for the Source. Make a note of the URL for the endpoint, as you will need to enter the endpoint URL in step 3.
2. Follow the [Opsgenie Webhook Integration ](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/webhook-integration) instructions to create a Webhook integration for the Opsgenie App. Webhook connections allow you to send Sumo Logic alerts to third-party applications that accept incoming Webhooks.
3. Specify the following parameters to send Opsgenie alerts to Sumo Logic:
   * For **Webhook URL** field provide Sumo Logic HTTP URL (from step 1).
   * Check **Add Alert Description to Payload.**
   * Check **Add Alert Details to Payload.**

   The Final Configuration for your integration should look similar to the following example:
4. (Optional) Create an Opsgenie - Sumo Logic Webhook integration for each team. Opsgenie Alerts are defined at the Team level. In the following example shows two Webhook Integrations, one for each team. Sending Opsgenie alerts to Sumo Logic for analysis with the predefined searches and dashboards provided by the Opsgenie App.


## Installing the Opsgenie App

This section provides instructions for installing the Opsgenie App, as well as examples of each of the app dashboards.

## Viewing OpsGenie Dashboards

:::tip Filter with template variables    
Template variables provide dynamic dashboards that can rescope data on the fly. As you apply variables to troubleshoot through your dashboard, you view dynamic changes to the data for a quicker resolution to the root cause. You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filter with template variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables.md).

### Overview

The **Opsgenie - Overview Dashboard** provides a high level view of alert types, details, trends, and comparisons. The at-a-glance graphs are an easy to access visual reference for alert breakdowns by source, team, priority, recipient, and tags.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor key KPIs such as Alerts Created/Closed/Escalated/Acknowledged/Escalated to Next.
* Track trends for different alert types in the Alerts over Time panel.
* Identify any spikes or unusual behavior in your DevOps environment, then identify the root cause by drilling further down to view related fields.

### Alert Details

The **Opsgenie - Alert Details Dashboard** provides detailed graphs and analytics for alert outliers, escalated alerts, and alert summaries.

Use this dashboard to:
* Gain visibility into the summary and source of the incident to help DevOps teams debug the root cause of the issue.
* Use panel filters to slice the information by source, priority, team and users.
* Track outlier in Alert Escalations to notify on-call teams to take appropriate action, and prevent any production outages.

### Alert Breakdown

The **Opsgenie - Alert Breakdown Dashboard** provides visual graphs and detailed tables with analytics on alerts by priority, source, team, users, tags, and recipient, over time and by comparison.

Use this dashboard to:

* Provide further visibility into alerts by breaking them down by different dimensions such as team, source, tags, users and priority.
* Use bar graphs to identify unusual behavior or spikes across these dimensions.
* Compare current status of Opsgenie Alerts within your Infrastructure to Yesterdayâ€™s status
