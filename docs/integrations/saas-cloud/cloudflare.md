This application has been developed and is supported by Cloudflare. In case of technical questions, please review the technical [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/) for Cloudflare logs or email [analytics@cloudflare.com](mailto:analytics@cloudflare.com).

The Cloudflare App provides a set of dashboards that make analyzing Cloudflare logs easy, helping you to understand events and trends from your websites and applications on the Cloudflare network. Logs are gathered from all 160+ Cloudflare data centers in near real-time and can be combined with other data sources, such as your origin data, to provide unique insights and help you improve the performance and security of your websites and applications.


## Log Types

The Cloudflare App uses HTTP request logs in JSON format gathered from all of the 160+ Cloudflare data centers. By default, timestamps are returned as Unix nanosecond integers. We recommend using the RFC 3339 format for sending logs to Sumo Logic. For a description of the fields available in the logs see link [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull-api/#fields).


### Sample Log Message

```json
{
"ClientIP": "89.163.242.206",
"ClientRequestHost": "www.theburritobot.com",
"ClientRequestMethod": "GET",
"ClientRequestURI": "/static/img/testimonial-hipster.png",
"EdgeEndTimestamp": 2018-12-15T02:20:57Z,
"EdgeResponseBytes": 69045,
"EdgeResponseStatus": 200,
"EdgeStartTimestamp": 2018-12-15T02:20:57Z,
"RayID": "3a6050bcbe121a87"
}
```

### Sample Query

The following log query is from the ‘Total Number of Requests’ panel in the ‘Cloudflare - Snapshot’ dashboard.

```sql
ClientCountry*
| json "EdgePathingSrc", "EdgePathingOp","EdgePathingStatus", "ClientCountry",
"ClientIP", "ClientDeviceType", "ClientRequestHost", "ClientRequestUserAgent",
"ClientRequestURI", "OriginResponseStatus", "EdgeResponseStatus", "OriginIP",
"ClientIPClass" as edge_pathing_src, edge_pathing_op, edge_pathing_status, client_country,
client_ip, client_device_type, client_request_host, client_request_user_agent,
client_request_uri, origin_response_status, edge_response_status, origin_ip, client_ip_class
| count
```

## Collecting Logs for Cloudflare

This section shows you how to set up a Hosted Collector and specify a Sumo Logic Source.


### Set up a Hosted Collector and Specify a Sumo Logic Source

#### Prerequisites

To send Cloudflare logs to Sumo Logic, you must first configure Cloudflare Logs to send logs to AWS S3 using [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush) or [Logpull](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpull-api/).

To set up a Hosted Collector and specify a Sumo Logic Source, do the following:

1. Follow the instructions for [Configuring a Hosted Collector in Sumo Logic to start collecting logs](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector).
2. Follow the instructions for [Configure an Amazon S3 Source in Sumo Logic](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-s3-source). When setting up an S3 Source, it's important to specify the correct timestamp field. Follow the next steps to do so.
3. To forward logs to Cloud SIEM Enterprise, click **+Add Field** with the key `_parser` and value `/Parsers/System/Cloudflare/Cloudflare Logpush`
5. Click **Advanced**, if the settings are not already shown.
6. For Timestamp Format, select **Specify a format** and enter the following:
   * **Format:** `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'`
   * **Timestamp Locator:** `\"EdgeStartTimestamp\"\s*:\s*\"(.*)\"`
7. Click **Test**. A Test Timestamp Parsing dialog appears.
8. Enter a sample log message in the Test Timestamp Parsing dialog, such as the following, and then click **Test**: **"EdgeStartTimestamp":"2018-12-19T23:38:10Z"**. A dialog confirming that your timestamp format matched should appear.
9. Click **Done** and then click **Save** to save the timestamp parsing to the source.


## Installing the Cloudflare App

This section has instructions for installing the Cloudflare App for Sumo and descriptions of each of the dashboards.

Now that you've set up log and metric collection, you can install the Cloudflare App, and use its pre-configured searches and [dashboards](#viewing-dashboards).

To install the app, do the following:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see [Installing the Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app. 
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source. 
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list. 
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (_sourceCategory=MyCategory). 
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.


## Viewing the Cloudflare Dashboards

**All dashboard have a set of filters** that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

**Each panel has a set of filters** that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.


### Snapshot

**Cloudflare - Snapshot Dashboard** provides an at-a-glance overview of the most important metrics from your websites and applications on the Cloudflare network. You can use dashboard filters to further slice and dice the information for granular analysis of events and trends.

Use this dashboard to:
* Monitor the most important web traffic metrics of your websites and applications on the Cloudflare network.
* View what countries and IPs your traffic is coming from and analyze the breakdown between mobile and desktop traffic, protocol, methods, and content types.
