## Log Types

The Druva Cyber Resilience App utilizes Sumo Logic's Druva Cyber Resilience Source to gather [Events](https://developer.druva.com/reference/listeventsbytracker) from Cyber Resilience.

## Sample log message

```json title="Sample Event"
{
      "id": 20,
      "area": "Platform",
      "category": "Admin Event",
      "type": "Admin Login",
      "occurenceTime": 1610707530,

_source="Milan_Druva_Cyber_Resilience_v0.0.1"
| json "id","area","category","type","syslogSeverity","syslogFacility" as id,area,category,type,syslog_severity,syslog_facility nodrop
| if (syslog_severity=0,"Emergency",if(syslog_severity = 1,"Alert",if(syslog_severity = 2,"Critical",if(syslog_severity=3,"Error",if(syslog_severity = 4,"Warning",if(syslog_severity=5,"Notice",if(syslog_severity=6,"Informational",if(syslog_severity=7,"Debug","None")))))))) as syslog_severity
// global filters
| where type matches "{{type}}"
| where category matches "{{category}}"
| where syslog_severity matches "{{syslog_severity}}"
| where area matches "{{area}}"
| count by id
