The Sumo Logic app for Trust Login helps security analysts monitor authentication events, user activities, and potential security threats. It tracks login attempts, account changes, and policy updates in real time to detect anomalies. The Trust Login dashboard provides insights into event breakdowns, trends, and time-based comparisons, facilitating faster incident response and investigations. Additionally, the geo-location metrics identify login attempts from high-risk regions, enhancing threat detection. The alert mechanism highlights unusual activities, such as suspicious logins and geo-location events, enabling proactive threat mitigation. By centralizing security insights, the app improves visibility, streamlines investigations, and strengthens overall security.

## Log types

This app uses Sumo Logic’s [Trust Login Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/trust-login-source/) to collect incidents and events logs from the Trust Login platform.
