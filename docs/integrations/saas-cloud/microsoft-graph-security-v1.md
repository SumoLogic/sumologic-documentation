The Sumo Logic App for Microsoft Graph Security V1 enables you to identify security threats by analyzing alert logs and helps you to improve web security posture, proactively detect and mitigate potential security risks, and improve compliance with security policies and regulations.

:::caution
This version of the app uses alerts from Microsoft Graph API (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/alert-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) and continues to be supported for existing customers who are bringing in alerts from that source. If you are setting up a new cloud-to-cloud source, it will use API V2 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/security-list-alerts_v2?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) which is covered by the [Microsoft Graph Security V2 app](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/microsoft-graph-security-v2).
:::

Key features of the Microsoft Graph Security app include:
- Detect and mitigate potential ransomware attacks.
- Monitor endpoint security and identify potential threats.
- High-level overview of the organizational security posture, including metrics such as the number of alerts, alert severity, and status.
- Allows security teams to identify potential threats and take appropriate action based on the trends and patterns of security alerts over time.

## Log types

This app uses Sumo Logic’s Microsoft Graph Security Source to collect [Alerts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/alert-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) from Microsoft Graph Security.

## Viewing Microsoft Graph Security dashboards​​

* All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

 You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

* Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.
