The Sumo Logic app for JumpCloud Directory Insights provides comprehensive visibility into user activities, authentication events, and security actions in the JumpCloud managed environment. By using JumpCloud Directory Insights logs, this app enables IT administrators and security analysts to monitor access, detect anomalies, and respond to security threats efficiently.

With pre-configured dashboards, the app delivers insights into user authentication trends, directory modifications, policy enforcement, and security incidents. Analysts can track failed login attempts, privileged access changes, and account lockouts in real time to improve security and ensure organizational policy compliance.

:::info
This app includes [built-in monitors](#jumpcloud-directory-insights-monitors). For details on creating custom monitors, refer to the [Create monitors for JumpCloud Directory Insights app](#create-monitors-for-the-jumpcloud-directory-insights-app).
:::

## Log types

This app uses Sumo Logicâ€™s [JumpCloud Directory Insights Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/jumpcloud-directory-insights-source) to collect the logs from the JumpCloud Directory Insights platform.

### JumpCloud Directory Insights monitors

| Name | Description | Trigger Type (Critical / Warning / MissingData) | Alert Condition |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Alerts Created` | This alert is triggered when potential security risks, configuration issues, or critical system events requiring investigation are identified. | Critical | Count > 3 |
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Disabled MFA` | This alert is triggered when unauthorized flags or accidental removal of MFA are identified. This could expose accounts to compromise and immediate review is recommended to ensure compliance and security. | Critical | Count > 0 |
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Events from Embargoed Locations` | This alert is triggered when logins or actions from embargoed locations are detected, suggesting potential unauthorized access. Investigate to confirm legitimacy or block malicious actors. | Critical | Count > 0 |
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Impossible Logins` | This alert is triggered when the user account is compromised. For example, a user logging in from two distant locations consecutively. Immediate investigation is required to rule out credential theft. | Critical | Count > 0 |
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Unsuccessful Logins` | This alert is triggered when credentials are misconfigured, or when brute-force attacks and credential stuffing are detected. Review source IPs and lock accounts if suspicious activity is confirmed. | Critical | Count > 1 |
| `JumpCloud Directory Insights - Unsuccessful SSOs` | This alert is triggered by misconfigurations in identity providers or malicious attempts to bypass SSO. Check SSO logs to identify the cause or any threats. | Critical | Count > 1 |
