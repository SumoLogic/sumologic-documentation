The Sumo Logic app for Salesforce analyzes logs generated by Salesforce Event Monitoring, which provides insight into your Salesforce instance and Salesforce apps. This app allows you to monitor APEX and API performance, logins, report performance, setup audit activity, user activity, and user agents.

Salesforce generates event logs during non-peak hours, every 24 hours. This means that you may not see data fill your Dashboard Panels for at least 24 hours. If you do not see data in 48 hours, contact Salesforce customer support.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic app for Salesforce uses Salesforce Event Log Files. The number of log types you receive depends on the Event Monitoring Edition that you sign up for.  

For details, see the Salesforce [Event Monitoring Quick Start Guide](http://www.salesforcehacker.com/2015/03/event-monitoring-quick-start-guide.html).

For the complete list of available events and fields, see [Event Monitoring Event Types](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_eventlogfile_supportedeventtypes.htm).

### Sample queries

```sql title="Most Accessed Reports"
_sourceCategory=salesforce event type "Report"
| json "REPORT_ID_DERIVED","REPORT_ID_DERIVED_LOOKUP" as report_id, report_name
| count by report_name, report_id
| format("%s : %s",report_name, report_id) as report_id
| count by report_id
| sort by _count desc | top 20 report_id by _count
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up log collection, review the required prerequisites and process overview described in the following sections. Installing the Sumo Logic App for Salesforce requires the following:

* Your Salesforce subscription must include the [Salesforce Event Monitoring](https://www.salesforce.com/form/pdf/platform-event-monitoring.jsp) add-on, which is required to obtain all of the data presented in the app dashboards. The add-on enables access to all event types in the Salesforce EventLogFile, the LoginEvent object, Transaction Security, and the Event Monitoring Analytics App. For more information, see [Get Started with Event Monitoring](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/modules/event_monitoring/units/event_monitoring_intro) and [Enable Event Monitoring](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=Enabling-Event-Monitoring&language=en_US&type=1).
* You will need a user with the permissions API Enabled and View Event Log Files (or View All Data). For assistance, you may need to contact your Salesforce administrator. (See Salesforce Configuration for steps.)
* Your system must run JRE 7. If you do not meet this requirement, you may see an exception similar to:
  ```bash
  Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: \
  com/sumologic/content/tools/apiclient/SumoJanus : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0
  ```
  * If your Salesforce instance does not support Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.0, you will be required to run JRE 8 instead of JRE 7. Specifically, if you see an error message like this when the script queries data:
  ```bash
  TLS 1.0 has been disabled in this organization.
  Please use TLS 1.1 or higher when connecting to Salesforce using https.
  ```
* You may do the configuration steps on a  system with a web browser for authentication via OAuth2, and then move the configuration folder to your production system. Or if your production system has a web browser, all steps may be done on that system.

## Set up collection

To set up collection, follow the instructions in [Salesforce Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/salesforce-source). These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a source using the Salesforce Source category, which you will need to use when installing the app. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Salesforce app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your Salesforce data.
