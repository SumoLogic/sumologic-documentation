The Sumo Logic App for Box provides insight into user behavior patterns, monitors resources, and even tracks administrative activities. The app consists of three predefined Dashboards, providing visibility into your environment for real time analysis.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic app for Box collects Box events, which are described in detail [here](https://developer.box.com/guides/events/).

### Sample log messages

```json
{
   "source": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "225980941",
      "name": "First Last",
      "login": "user@sumologic.com"
   },
   "created_by": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "225980941",
      "name": "First Last",
      "login": "user@sumologic.com"
   },
   "created_at": "2016-12-15T11:08:58-08:00",
   "event_id": "7988d00a-aca3-4454-9021-652477f4fa78",
   "event_type": "LOGIN",
   "ip_address": "1.1.1.1",
   "type": "event",
   "session_id": null,
   "additional_details": null
}
```

```json
{
   "source": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "262207389",
      "name": "user",
      "login": "luser@sumologic.com"
   },
   "created_by": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "225980941",
      "name": "first last",
      "login": "user1@sumologic.com"
   },
   "created_at": "2016-12-14T16:09:33-08:00",

   "ip_address": "1.1.1.1",
   "type": "event",
   "session_id": null,
   "additional_details": null
}
```

### Sample queries

```sql title="Top 10 Failed Logins"
_sourceCategory=box  type "event_type" login
| json "created_at","ip_address","event_type","created_by.name","created_by.login" as messagetime,src_ip,event_type, src_user,src_login nodrop
| json "source.name","source.login","source.type"  as dest_user,dest_login, item_type nodrop
| where event_type="FAILED_LOGIN"
| count as EventCount by src_user,src_login,src_ip | top 10 src_user,src_login,src_ip by EventCount
```

## Collecting Events for Box

This section provides instructions for setting up event collection from Box for analysis in Sumo Logic. Before you begin setting up log collection, review the required prerequisites and process overview described in the following sections.

The Box API integration ingests events from the [Get Events API](https://developer.box.com/reference/get-events/). It securely stores the required authentication, scheduling, and state tracking information.

### Authentication

You'll need a Box App Key, App Secret, and Access Code to provide to Sumo Logic.

Complete the following steps to get the credentials:
1. Login into the [Box Account](https://app.box.com/login).
1. Create and register a new app from the [App Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console). To register the App with Box follow [these](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/#app-creation-steps) steps. Select **Server Authentication (with JWT)** as the authentication method. Note that use of a key pair requires  2-step verification to be enabled on Box.
1. Generate `public private key pair` as described in the following steps [Key Pair](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/#public-and-private-key-pair) and download the JSON file.
1. Go to the `Configuration` and change `App Access Level` to `App + Enterprise Access` and enable `Manage Enterprise properties` in `Application Scopes` and save changes as shown below.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source4.png')} alt="Box" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" /> <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source5.png')} alt="Box" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" /> <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source6.png')} alt="Box" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
1. Authorize your app by following the steps in [Authorize](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/jwt/jwt-setup/#app-authorization).


### States

A Box Source tracks errors, reports its health, and start-up progress. Youâ€™re informed, in real-time, if the Source is having trouble connecting, if there's an error requiring user action, or if it is healthy and collecting by utilizing [Health Events](/docs/manage/health-events).

A Box Source goes through the following states when created:
1. **Pending**. Once the Source is submitted, it is validated, stored, and placed in a **Pending** state.
1. **Started**. A collection task is created on the Hosted Collector.
1. **Initialized**. The task configuration is complete in Sumo Logic.
1. **Authenticated**. The Source successfully authenticated with Box.
1. **Collecting**. The Source is actively collecting data from Box.

If the Source has any issues during any one of these states, it is placed in an **Error** state.

When you delete the Source, it is placed in a **Stopping** state. When it has successfully stopped, it is deleted from your Hosted Collector.

On the Collection page, the [Health](/docs/manage/health-events#collection-page) and Status for Sources is displayed. Use [Health Events](/docs/manage/health-events) to investigate issues with collection.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source3.png')} alt="Box" />

You can click the text in the Health column, such as **Error**, to open the issue in Health Events to investigate.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/hover-c2c-error.png')} alt="Box" />

Hover your mouse over the status icon to view a tooltip with details on the detected issue.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/health-error-generic.png')} alt="Box" />

### Create a Box source

When you create a Box Source, you add it to a Hosted Collector. Before creating the Source, identify the Hosted Collector you want to use or create a new Hosted Collector. For instructions, see [Create a Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors#Create_a_Hosted_Collector).

To configure a Box Source:
1. In Sumo Logic, navigate to **Manage Data > Collection** and open the **Collection** tab.
1. On the Collectors page, click **Add Source** next to a Hosted Collector.
1. Select **Box**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source2.png')} alt="Box" width="100" />
1. Enter a **Name** for the Source. The **description** is optional. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/send-data/box-source1.png')} alt="Box" width="400" />
1. (Optional) For **Source Category**, enter any string to tag the output collected from the Source. Category [metadata](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/built-in-metadata) is stored in a searchable field called `_sourceCategory`.
1. **Forward to SIEM**. Check the checkbox to forward your data to [Cloud SIEM](/docs/cse).<br/>When configured with the **Forward to SIEM** option, the following metadata fields are set:
<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Field Name   </td>
   <td>Value   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>_siemVendor</code>   </td>
   <td>Box   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>_siemProduct</code>   </td>
   <td>Enterprise Events   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>_siemFormat</code>   </td>
   <td>JSON   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>_siemEventID</code>   </td>
   <td>&#123;event_type&#125;   </td>
  </tr>
</table>
1. (Optional) **Fields**. Click the **+Add** link to add custom log metadata [Fields](/docs/manage/fields).
    * Define the fields you want to associate, each field needs a name (key) and value.
        * ![green check circle.png](/img/reuse/green-check-circle.png) A green circle with a checkmark is shown when the field exists and is enabled in the Fields table schema.
        * ![orange exclamation point.png](/img/reuse/orange-exclamation-point.png) An orange triangle with an exclamation point is shown when the field doesn't exist, or is disabled, in the Fields table schema. In this case, an option to automatically add or enable the nonexistent fields to the Fields table schema is provided. If a field is sent to Sumo that does not exist in the Fields schema or is disabled it is ignored, known as dropped.
1. Upload the JSON file.
1. **Processing Rules**. Configure any desired filters, such as allowlist, denylist, hash, or mask, as described in [Create a Processing Rule](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules/create-processing-rule).
1. When you are finished configuring the Source, click **Submit**.

## Error types

When Sumo Logic detects an issue it is tracked by [Health Events](/docs/manage/health-events). The following table shows the three possible error types, the reason the error would occur, if the Source attempts to retry, and the name of the event log in the Health Event Index.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Type   </td>
   <td>Reason   </td>
   <td>Retries   </td>
   <td>Retry Behavior   </td>
   <td>Health Event Name   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>ThirdPartyConfig   </td>
   <td>Normally due to an invalid configuration. You'll need to review your Source configuration and make an update.   </td>
   <td>No retries are attempted until the Source is updated.   </td>
   <td>Not applicable   </td>
   <td>ThirdPartyConfigError </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>ThirdPartyGeneric   </td>
   <td>Normally due to an error communicating with the third party service APIs.   </td>
   <td>Yes   </td>
   <td>The Source will retry for up to 90 minutes, after which it quits.   </td>
   <td>ThirdPartyGenericError   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FirstPartyGeneric </td>
   <td>Normally due to an error communicating with the internal Sumo Logic APIs.   </td>
   <td>Yes   </td>
   <td>The Source will retry for up to 90 minutes, after which it quits.   </td>
   <td>FirstPartyGenericError   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### JSON configuration

Sources can be configured using UTF-8 encoded JSON files with the [Collector Management API](/docs/api/collector-management). See [how to use JSON to configure Sources](/docs/send-data/use-json-configure-sources) for details.
