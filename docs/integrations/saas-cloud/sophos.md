## Log types

This app uses Sumo Logicâ€™s Sophos Source to collect [Alerts](https://developer.sophos.com/docs/common-v1/1/routes/alerts/get) and [Events](https://developer.sophos.com/docs/siem-v1/1/routes/events/get) from the Sophos Central platform.

### Alerts Overview

The **Sophos - Alerts Overview** dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of security alerts across your network. This dashboard helps you to visualize the total number of alerts and their severity, breaking them into High, Medium, and Low categories to facilitate a prioritized response to critical threats. The dashboard highlights the top 10 most common alert types, providing insight into recurring security issues that require attention. It tracks alert trends over time and by categories such as panic, runtime detections, and policy, helping to identify patterns and shifts in the threat landscape. Additionally, it provides a detailed breakdown of alerts by their source (for example: computer, mobile) and the products affected (for example, encryption, endpoint), as well as a ranking of tenants based on the number of alerts, useful for organizations with multi-tenant environments. The recent alerts section lists the latest incidents with detailed descriptions, enabling quick analysis and response.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Sophos/Sophos-Alerts-Events.png')} alt="Sophos-Alerts-Events" />

### Sophos alerts

The Sumo Logic app for Sophos includes a comprehensive set of monitors designed to enhance security monitoring and incident response. These alerts are triggered by critical security events, such as the detection of blocklisted activities, high-severity alerts, and events indicating potential threats like ransomware or malicious traffic. For instance, specific alerts notify when malware cannot be automatically cleaned up, when real-time protection is disabled for an extended period, or when ransomware attempts to access the file system. By focusing on the severity and nature of these security incidents, the app provides actionable insights, enabling security teams to respond promptly and effectively to emerging threats.
