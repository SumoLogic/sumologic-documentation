The Sumo Logic App for Akamai DataStream is designed to monitor and analyze the performance of your Akamai Edge server, and request handling pipeline. It helps to identify any issues that may be impacting your users' experience. This app is tailored to work with the logs generated by Akamai DataStream 2, which include valuable information about each request, such as the request path, status code, response time, and more.

Akamai DataStream app provides pre-built queries that allow you to analyze your logs by various parameters, including response time, status code, request path, and more. In addition, this app includes dashboards that allow you to visualize your log data to easily understand the trends and patterns. You can also use these dashboards to monitor key metrics, such as request volume, response time, and error rate, which assists you in identifying any anomalies or issues.

## Log Types

This App uses Akamai Source to collect [DataStream 2 Logs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/docs/log-format-1#sample-log-lines) for Akamai DataStream.
