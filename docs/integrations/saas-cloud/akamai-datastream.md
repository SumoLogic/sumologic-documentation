The Sumo Logic App for Akamai DataStream is designed to monitor and analyze the performance of your Akamai Edge server, and request handling pipeline. It helps to identify any issues that may be impacting your users' experience. This app is tailored to work with the logs generated by Akamai DataStream 2, which include valuable information about each request, such as the request path, status code, response time, and more. 

Akamai DataStream app provides pre-built queries that allow you to analyze your logs by various parameters, including response time, status code, request path, and more. In addition, this app includes dashboards that allow you to visualize your log data to easily understand the trends and patterns. You can also use these dashboards to monitor key metrics, such as request volume, response time, and error rate, which assists you in identifying any anomalies or issues.

## Log Types

This App uses Akamai Source to collect [DataStream 2 Logs](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/docs/log-format-1#sample-log-lines) for Akamai DataStream.

## Setup Collection

Follow the instructions for setting up [Integration for Akamai DataStream 2](https://techdocs.akamai.com/datastream2/docs/stream-sumo-logic) source and use the same source category while installing the app.

## Installing the App

Now that you have configured Akamai DataStream 2 logs, install the Sumo Logic App for Akamai DataStream to take advantage of the pre-configured searches and dashboards. Follow the instructions below to install the app:

Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
2. Select the version of the service you're using and click **Add to Library**. Version selection is applicable only to a few apps currently. For more information, see [Installing the Apps from the Library](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#install-apps-from-the-library).
3. To install the app, complete the following fields.
    1. **App Name.** You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    2. **Data Source.** Select either of these options for the data source.
        * Choose **Source Category**, and select a source category from the list.
        * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and enter a custom source category beginning with an underscore. Example: (`_sourceCategory=MyCategory`).
    3. **Advanced**. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the Personal folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
4. Click **Add to Library**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data matching the time range query and received since the panel was created. Results won't immediately be available, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
