The Sumo Logic app for Webex provides comprehensive monitoring and analysis of Webex environments, offering real-time visibility into security events, user activities, and system health. This app includes pre-built dashboards and queries that help organizations quickly identify and respond to security incidents, track user behaviors, manage device activities, and ensure compliance. With detailed insights into login events, authorization activities, device management, and administrative actions, this app enhances operational efficiency and strengthens security postures by providing actionable intelligence.

## Log type

This app uses Sumo Logic’s [Webex Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/webex-source/) to collect [Admin Audit events](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/admin-audit-events/list-admin-audit-events) from the Webex platform.
