The Sumo Logic App for Armis offers enhanced visibility into both alerts and device data, making it easier to monitor and manage your device security. The app features dashboards that analyze alerts by severity, status, and type, providing a clear picture of the trend of alerts over time. Additionally, the app allows you to monitor devices by risk level, type, and category, and provides a table view of the latest devices with key information to keep your IT infrastructure secure.

## Log types

The Sumo Logic App for Armis gathers log information from the following two sources.

**Alerts**. These are notifications or warnings generated when a potential security threat is detected. The alerts provide information about the type of threat, its severity, and other relevant details.

| Path | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:-------|
| `activityIds` | Number  | The activity IDs of the alert. |  
| `activityUUIDs` | String | The activity UUIDs of the alert. |
| `alertId` | Number | The ID of the alert. |
| `connectionIds` | Number | The connection IDs of the alert.|
| `description` | String | A text description of the alert. |
| `deviceIds` | Number | The device IDs of the alert. |
| `severity` | String | The severity of the alert. |
| `status` | String | The status of the alert. |
| `time` | Date | The date and time the alert occurred. |
| `title` | String | The title of the alert. |
| `type` | String | The type of the alert. |


**Device**. These logs are generated by the devices being managed by Armis and contain information about device activity, configuration changes, and other relevant details. The device logs help in understanding device behavior and assist in troubleshooting.

| Path | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:----|
| `accessSwitch` | String | The access switch of the device. |

| where severity matches"{{Severity}}" and  status matches"{{Status}}" and type matches"{{Type}}"
| extract field=deviceIds "(?<ids>\b\d+\b)" multi
| where "{{Site}}" = "*" or [subquery: (_sourceCategory=ArmisDashboards id)
  | json "id","site.name" as ids, site
  | where site matches "{{Site}}"
  | compose ids]
| count_distinct(alertId)
```

```sql title="Device"
_sourceCategory=ArmisDashboards id
| json "id","name","manufacturer","model","riskLevel","sensor","site.name","type","category","operatingSystem" as id, name, manufacturer, model, riskLevel, sensor, site, type, category, operatingSystem nodrop
