The Sumo Logic App for Armis offers enhanced visibility into both alerts and device data, making it easier to monitor and manage your device security. The app features dashboards that analyze alerts by severity, status, and type, providing a clear picture of the trend of alerts over time. Additionally, the app allows you to monitor devices by risk level, type, and category, and provides a table view of the latest devices with key information to keep your IT infrastructure secure.

## Log Types

The Sumo Logic App for Armis gathers log information from the following two sources.

**Alerts**. These are notifications or warnings generated when a potential security threat is detected. The alerts provide information about the type of threat, its severity, and other relevant details.

| Path | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:-------|
| `activityIds` | Number  | The activity IDs of the alert. |  
| `activityUUIDs` | String | The activity UUIDs of the alert. |
| `alertId` | Number | The ID of the alert. |
| `connectionIds` | Number | The connection IDs of the alert.|
| `description` | String | A text description of the alert. |
| `deviceIds` | Number | The device IDs of the alert. |
| `severity` | String | The severity of the alert. |
| `status` | String | The status of the alert. |
| `time` | Date | The date and time the alert occurred. |
| `title` | String | The title of the alert. |
| `type` | String | The type of the alert. |


**Device**. These logs are generated by the devices being managed by Armis and contain information about device activity, configuration changes, and other relevant details. The device logs help in understanding device behavior and assist in troubleshooting.

| Path | Type | Description |
|:-------|:-----------|:----|
| `accessSwitch` | String | The access switch of the device. |
| `category` | String | The category of the device. |
| `firstSeen` | Date | The first time the device was seen. |

| `ipaddress` | String | The IP address of the device. |
| `ipv6` | String | The IPv6 address of the device. |
| `lastSeen` | Date | The last time the device was seen. |
| `macAddress` | String | The MAC address of the device. |
| `manufacturer` | String | The manufacturer of the device. |
| `model` | String| The model of the device. |

### Sample Queries

This section contains the sample queries of both the `Alerts` and `Device`.

```sql title="Total Alerts"
_sourceCategory=ArmisDashboards alertId
| json "alertId","activityUUIDs","connectionIds","description","deviceIds","severity","status","time","title","type" as alertId,activityUUIDs,connectionIds,description,deviceIds,severity,status,time,title,type nodrop
| where severity matches"{{Severity}}" and  status matches"{{Status}}" and type matches"{{Type}}"
| extract field=deviceIds "(?<ids>\b\d+\b)" multi
| where "{{Site}}" = "*" or [subquery: (_sourceCategory=ArmisDashboards id)
  | json "id","site.name" as ids, site
  | where site matches "{{Site}}"
  | compose ids]
| count_distinct(alertId)
```

```sql title="Device"
_sourceCategory=ArmisDashboards id
| json "id","name","manufacturer","model","riskLevel","sensor","site.name","type","category","operatingSystem" as id, name, manufacturer, model, riskLevel, sensor, site, type, category, operatingSystem nodrop
| where site matches "{{Site}}" and manufacturer matches "{{Manufacturer}}" and type matches "{{Type}}"
| count_distinct(id)
```

## Collecting Logs for Armis API

This section explains how to collect logs from Armis API and ingest them into Sumo Logic. Refer to the [Armis API Cloud-to-Cloud Integration](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/armis-api-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

## Installing the Armis App

{@import ../../reuse/app-install.md}

## Viewing the Armis Dashboards​

* All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

 You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

* Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.
