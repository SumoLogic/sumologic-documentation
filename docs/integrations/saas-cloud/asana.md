## Set up collection

To set up [Cloud to Cloud Integration Asana Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/asana-source/) for the Asana app, follow the instructions provided. These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a source using the Asana Source category, which you will need to use when installing the app. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Asana app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your Asana data.

## Installing the Asana app

This section has instructions for installing the Asana spp for Sumo Logic and description of the dashboard.
Locate and install the app you need from the **App Catalog**. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.
1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app.
1. Select **Add Integration** button to install the app.
1. Configure the Asana app using the steps described in the [Asana Cloud-to-Cloud Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/asana-source/). If you already have set up your data, skip this step by clicking on **Next**.
1. Complete the following fields:
   1. **Data Source**. Select either of these options for the data source:
      * Choose **Source Category** and then choose a source category from the list.
      * Select **Enter a Custom Data Filter** and type in a custom source category that starts with an underscore. For Example, `_sourceCategory=MyCategory`.
    2. **Folder Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    3. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the **Personal** folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
1. Click **Next**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. You can share it with your organization.

The panels will begin to fill automatically. It's worth noting that each panel gradually fills with data that matches the time range query and has been received since the panel was created. The results will not be available right away, but with some patience, you will be able to view full graphs and maps.
