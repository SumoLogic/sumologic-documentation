## Set up collection

Follow the instructions provided to set up [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration for CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/crowdstrike-filevantage-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app. By following these steps, you can ensure that your CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage data.

## Installing the CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage app

import AppInstall2 from '../../reuse/apps/app-install-v2.md';

<AppInstall2/>

## Viewing CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage dashboards

import ViewDashboards from '../../reuse/apps/view-dashboards.md';

<ViewDashboards/>

### Overview

The **CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage - Overview** dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of file and directory activity, helping security analysts monitor file integrity, and identify potential risks. It provides a total count of the file changes, categorizing them by severity: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, and **Low**, to prioritize investigations. Suppressed changes, which are ignored due to predefined policies are also highlighted.

Key metrics include file change types (**WRITE**, **RENAME**, **READ** **PERMISSION**, **OTHERS**, and/or **DELETE**), displayed in an easy-to-read pie chart for quick analysis. The dashboard tracks changes by operating system, identifies top hosts and users making changes, and highlights threats or anomalies.

The dashboard also shows the monitoring rules that triggered the most changes, assisting in policy refinement. A detailed table of recent file activities, including timestamps, hostnames, file paths, severities, and associated policies, is provided. Overall, the dashboard strengthens the detection and response to unauthorized or suspicious file activities. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Crowdstrike+Falcon+FileVantage/CrowdStrike+Falcon+FileVantage+-+Overview.png')} alt="CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage Overview" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
 
### Security

The **CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage - Security** dashboard is tailored for security analysts to monitor high-risk file actions and potential policy violations. It categorizes file activities based on severity (**CRITICAL**, **HIGH**, **LOW**, and **MEDIUM**) and action types, such as file creation, deletion, renaming, and attribute changes. This categorization helps analysts prioritize their responses to significant security events.

The dashboard tracks high-risk actions over time, enabling security teams to identify patterns or spikes in suspicious activity. There is also a dedicated section for policy violations, which lists instances where file changes conflict with configured security policies. This section includes details such as affected files, associated rules, and timestamps.

Additionally, security analysts can review file deletions with specific details, including file paths, user names, and originating countries. The severity trends are visually represented, providing a clear overview of security incidents over time and helping teams identify escalation points.

While the dashboard provides placeholders for tracking malicious file changes and directory changes, data in these sections requires specific configuration based on the environment. Finally, the **Host-Based Change Monitoring** table offers detailed insights into the hosts and host groups involved in file changes, assisting in pinpointing areas that need further investigation. Overall, this dashboard is a vital tool for ensuring file integrity and effectively mitigating risks. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/Crowdstrike+Falcon+FileVantage/CrowdStrike+Falcon+FileVantage+-+Security.png')} alt="CrowdStrike Falcon FileVantage Security" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />
