The Sumo Logic app for Symantec Web Security provides real-time insights into the web traffic and helps you to identify potential security threats. This app is based on a cloud-to-cloud Symantec Web Security Service source that collects Symantec Web Security access logs.
With the Sumo Logic app for Symantec Web Security, you can:
- **Monitor for web-based threats**. Monitor the web traffic for potential threats using access logs generated by the Symantec Web Security Service.
- **Detect and prevent malware infections**. Search access logs for patterns of behavior that are indicative of malware infections. It also provides integrations with threat intelligence sources, which can help you to quickly identify potential malware infections and take necessary action to prevent them.
- **Identify and block suspicious web activity**. You can use the app to monitor suspicious web activity, such as requests to known malicious sites.
- **Optimize web security policies**. This app provides insights into web traffic that can help you to optimize web security policies. You can also use the app to identify areas where policies may be too restrictive or too permissive and make adjustments accordingly.
