The Sumo Logic app for Symantec Web Security provides real-time insights into the web traffic and helps you to identify potential security threats. This app is based on a cloud-to-cloud Symantec Web Security Service source that collects Symantec Web Security access logs.
With the Sumo Logic app for Symantec Web Security, you can:
- **Monitor for web-based threats**. Monitor the web traffic for potential threats using access logs generated by the Symantec Web Security Service.
- **Detect and prevent malware infections**. Search access logs for patterns of behavior that are indicative of malware infections. It also provides integrations with threat intelligence sources, which can help you to quickly identify potential malware infections and take necessary action to prevent them.
- **Identify and block suspicious web activity**. You can use the app to monitor suspicious web activity, such as requests to known malicious sites.
- **Optimize web security policies**. This app provides insights into web traffic that can help you to optimize web security policies. You can also use the app to identify areas where policies may be too restrictive or too permissive and make adjustments accordingly.

## Log Types

This App uses [Symantec Web Security Service](docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/symantec-web-security-service-source/) to collect [Access Logs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/symantec-security-software/web-and-network-security/cloud-swg/help/wss-reference/accesslogformats-ref.html) from Symantec Web Security Service.

## Set up collection

To set up [Cloud to Cloud Integration Symantec Web Security Service Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/symantec-web-security-service-source/) for the Symantec Web Security Service App, follow the instructions provided. These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a source using the Symantec Web Security Service Source category, which you will need to use when installing the app. By following these steps, you can ensure that your Symantec Web Security Service app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your Symantec Web Security Service data.

## Installing the Symantec Web Security Service App​

This section has instructions for installing the Symantec Web Security Service App for Sumo Logic and descriptions of each of the dashboards.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.
1. Click **Add Integration**.
1. Configure **Symantec Web Security Service** app using the steps described in the [Symantec Web Security Service Cloud-to-Cloud Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/symantec-web-security-service-source/). If you already have set up your data, skip this step and click **Next**.
1. Complete the following fields.
   1. **Data Source**. Select either of these options for the data source:
      * Choose **Source Category** and then choose a source category from the list.
      * Select **Enter a Custom Data Filter** and enter a custom source category that starts with an underscore. For example, `_sourceCategory=MyCategory`.
    2. **Folder Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data that matches the time range query and has been received since the panel was created. Results will not be available right away, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
