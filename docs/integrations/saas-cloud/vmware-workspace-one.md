The Sumo Logic app for VMware Workspace ONE helps security analysts in monitoring device compliance, encryption, and overall security status. It provides dashboards that display non-compliant or compromised devices, along with data encryption deficiencies. Additionally, geolocation panels track device locations and identify instances of roaming in restricted areas. 

The app includes out-of-the-box alerts that notify analysts about critical security issues, such as compromised devices, non-compliance, and unauthorized roaming. These features enable analysts to identify and address risks, enforce security policies, and maintain a secure ecosystem for enterprise devices.

:::info
This app includes [built-in monitors](#vmware-workspace-one-monitors). For details on creating custom monitors, refer to the [Create monitors for VMware Workspace ONE app](#create-monitors-for-the-vmware-workspace-one-app).

## Log types

This app uses Sumo Logic’s [VMware Workspace ONE Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/vmware-workspace-one-source/) to collect audit logs from the VMware Workspace ONE platform.

## Viewing the VMware Workspace ONE dashboards​​

import ViewDashboards from '../../reuse/apps/view-dashboards.md';

<ViewDashboards/>

### Overview

The **VMware Workspace ONE - Overview** dashboard provides valuable insights into various security and compliance aspects. It displays the device information that has compromised statuses, gaps in data encryption, and device compliance. This dashboard provides insights into non-compliant devices and users, compromised devices and users, and non-data encrypted devices and users. Additionally, the geolocation panels provide a clear view of device locations and reveal any instances of roaming in restricted regions.<br/><img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/VMWare+Workspace+ONE/VMWare+Workspace+ONE+-+Overview.png' alt="VMware-Workspace-ONE-Overview" />

## Create monitors for the VMware Workspace ONE app

import CreateMonitors from '../../reuse/apps/create-monitors.md';

<CreateMonitors/>

### VMware Workspace ONE monitors

The VMware Workspace ONE monitors act as a security tool that focuses on tracking critical operations and identifying unusual activities within the VMware Workspace ONE platform. These notifications provide real-time insights into significant events, enabling security personnel to quickly respond to any deviations or breaches.

| Name | Description | Trigger Type (Critical / Warning / MissingData) | Alert Condition | 
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `Compromised Devices` | This alert is triggered when any devices marked as compromised in Workspace ONE are identified. It monitors the `compromised_status` field to initiate actions when devices are flagged, allowing analysts to promptly secure affected devices.| Critical | Count > 0 |
| `Non-Compliance Devices` | This alert is triggered when devices do not meet compliance standards as indicated by the `compliance_status` field. It ensures that devices adhere to organizational policies and regulatory requirements. | Critical | Count > 0|
| `Roaming Devices from Embargoed Countries` | This alert is triggered when devices are identified roaming in restricted or embargoed regions. It helps mitigate risks linked to unauthorized device movement in high-risk areas. | Critical | Count > 0|
