The Sumo Logic app for Proofpoint Targeted Attack Protection (TAP) app provides comprehensive visibility and analysis of messages and clicks of malicious URLs. Proofpoint TAP is a cybersecurity solution offered by Proofpoint, a leading cybersecurity company. By leveraging advanced technologies and threat intelligence, Proofpoint TAP helps organizations detect and mitigate sophisticated threats, reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks.

Key features of the Proofpoint TAP app include:

- **Message Protection**. Employs sophisticated email analysis techniques to identify malicious emails, such as those containing malware, ransomware, or phishing attempts.
- **URL Defense**. Analyzes URLs in real-time to identify malicious websites or links used for phishing or spreading malware. This app blocks access to these URLs, protecting you from potential threats.
- **Attachment Defense**. Examines email attachments for potential threats, including infected files or documents containing macros that can execute malicious code.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**. Gain real-time visibility into messages and clicks across your organization's infrastructure. Monitor and analyze messages, clicks, and suspicious activities to detect and respond to potential threats.
- **Interactive Dashboards**. Explore interactive dashboards that provide a holistic view of messages, clicks, and threat intelligence. Visualize data with pre-built charts, graphs, and tables to understand the trends, patterns, and anomalies.

## Log types

This app uses [Proofpoint TAP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/proofpoint-tap-source/) to collect messages and and retrieves SIEM events through the [SIEM API](https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/API_Documentation/SIEM_API).
