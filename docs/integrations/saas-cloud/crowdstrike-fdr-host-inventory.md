### CrowdStrike FDR Host Inventory alerts

| Name | Description | Trigger Type (Critical / Warning / MissingData) | Alert Condition | 
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `Device Prevention Policy Not Applied` | This alert is fired when the user has not applied the device prevention policy. CrowdStrike prevention policies are rules that determine how the CrowdStrike agent detects and prevents malware on endpoints. They are organized by operating system in the CrowdStrike console, and each operating system has its own set of policies. | Critical | Count > 0 | 
| `Device Sensor Update Policy Not Applied` | This alert is fired when the user has not applied the device sensor update policy. CrowdStrike's Device Sensor Update Policy allows customers to choose which parts of their fleet should install the latest sensor release, or an older version. This policy is part of the Falcon platform's protection mechanisms, which use AI and machine learning to identify and address advanced threats. | Critical | Count > 0|
