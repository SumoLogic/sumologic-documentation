The Sumo Logic App for Slack provides monitoring and data analytics for Slack users, channels, access logs for workspaces with free, standard, plus, and enterprise plans. The app is focused on **public channels** only.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a cloud-based set of software tools and online services that provide for secure collaboration across teams, departments, offices, and countries.

## Log Types

Slack logs are in JSON format. The Slack App utilizes the following log types:

* User logs
* Public channel logs
* Public message logs
* Access logs
* Audit logs

Sumo Logic’s Slack collector enhances the logs by adding a few metadata fields so the raw logs from Slack APIs might differ in format. The availability of all types of logs is determined by the [slack plans](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115003205446-Slack-plans-and-features-).

| Log Type | Free plan | Standard plan | Plus plan | Enterprise plan |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| User logs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Public Channel logs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Public Message logs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Access logs |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Audit logs |  |  |  | ✓ |

The sample query is from the **Channel Summary** panel of **Slack - Public Channels** dashboard.

```sql

## Collect logs for the Slack App

This legacy solution to pull logs from Slack to Sumo Logic has been replaced with a dedicated [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework). We recommend customers use the below [Slack Cloud-to-Cloud source](#create-slack-app-with-permissions) instead of the legacy Python collection method.

## Installing the Slack App

This section demonstrates how to install the Slack App.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing Slack Dashboards

**Each dashboard has a set of filters** that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level.

**Each panel has a set of filters** that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.
