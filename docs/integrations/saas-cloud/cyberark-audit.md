### Overview

The **CyberArk Audit - Overview** dashboard provides a comprehensive view of audit data, helping teams assess cybersecurity events in your organization. It displays key metrics like total events to display the volume of audit activities, explore events through service names and action types to reveal system access patterns. By categorizing events by audit and identity types, you can get insights into different event categories and user behaviors. Trend analysis and event distribution by geography helps you to identify anomalies, while summaries of deleted events highlights the active and ghost IT activities. This dashboard is the central nervous system for operational monitoring and strategic cybersecurity decisions. <br/><img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/CyberArk-Audit/CyberArk+Audit+-+Overview.png' alt="CyberArk-Audit-Overview" />

### Security Overview

The **CyberArk Audit - Security Overview** dashboard provides focuses on security metrics related to audit events for network administrators and cybersecurity teams. It highlights high-risk activities such as password resets, suspicious threats, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) events. The dashboard shows administrative events by location, noting activities from embargoed areas. It visualizes OAuth token generation trends to identify anomalies and secure access points. Summaries of password resets, administrative events, and login attempts help detect vulnerabilities and unauthorized access, enhancing cybersecurity defense. <br/><img src='https://sumologic-app-data-v2.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboards/CyberArk-Audit/CyberArk+Audit+-+Security+Overview.png' alt="CyberArk-Audit-Security-Overview" />
