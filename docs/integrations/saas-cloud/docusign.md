The Sumo Logic app for DocuSign helps you monitor and secure your DocuSign account by providing real-time actionable insights into critical events, alerts, and user activity, allowing you to identify and address potential security threats before they can cause harm. With the DocuSign app, you can also protect data loss, identify suspicious activity, maintain the security of your DocuSign account, and prevent data breaches - all from a single, centralized platform.

The app leverages the DocuSign Monitor API to collect and analyze data from your DocuSign account, including document access and modification, user activity, authentication activity, and system events. You can set up custom alerts for critical events and user activity, and receive notifications in real-time when potential security threats are detected.

With the DocuSign App, you can:
* Monitor who accesses and changes important documents and detect any instances of unauthorized access or modifications to sensitive documents.
* Monitor user actions to identify any suspicious behavior, including attempts to access unauthorized data or engage in malicious activity.
* Monitor login activity to identify any abnormal or suspicious login attempts or unusual patterns of activity.
* Monitor system events for any signs of anomalies or potential security threats.
* Protect data loss by closely monitoring access, changes, and unauthorized activity.
* Analyze user behavior to identify potential security threats by looking for deviations from normal patterns of activity.

## Log Types

The DocuSign App for Sumo Logic uses [Events](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/monitor101/events-alerts/events-list) and [Alerts](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/monitor-api/monitor101/events-alerts/alerts-list) data to generate logs that can be used for monitoring and analysis.

## Installing the DocuSign App

Before you begin, collect logs from DocuSign API and ingest them into Sumo Logic. Refer to the [DocuSign API Cloud-to-Cloud Integration](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/docusign-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing the DocuSign Dashboards

All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.

### DocuSign - Overview
