Fastly is a content delivery network (CDN) that provides you control over how and where you serve content, access to real-time performance analytics, and the ability to cache unpredictably changing content at the edge.


## Log Types

The Fastly app uses the following log types:
* Fastly CDN logs
* Fastly WAF Request and Debug logs. For information about WAF, logging see [Fastly WAF logging](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/web-application-firewall/fastly-waf-logging).


### Sample Queries

```sql title="Top Error-causing URLs"
_sourceCategory=fastly 50? | parse "\"reqPath\":\"*\"" as path, "\"status\":\"*\"" as status | urldecode(path) as path | where status > 499 | where status < 600 | count as errors by path | sort by errors
```

```sql title="Cache Performance"
_sourceCategory=fastly cacheStatus | parse "\"cacheStatus\":\"*\"" as status | where !(status="") | if(status="0", "0 - Non cacheable", if(status="1" OR status="2", "1/2 - Cache Hit", if(status="3", "3 - Cache Miss", ""))) as cachestatus | count by cachestatus
```

```sql title="Top Denials by Host"
_sourceCategory=fastly waf denyRules reqHost | parse "\"denyRules\":\"*\"" as deny, "\"reqHost\":\"*\"" as host | where deny != "" | timeslice 1m | count by host, _timeslice | transpose row _timeslice column host
```


## Collecting Logs for Fastly

This section has instructions for setting up log collection for the Fastly app.  


### Step 1: Configure collector and source

In this step, you configure a collector and source to receive Fastly logs.

1. Add a [Sumo Logic Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector) to your Sumo Logic Org.
2. Configure an [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) for your Fastly request logs. Make sure to set the Source Category when configuring the HTTP source. For example, `fastly`. Make a note of the Source Category you assign to the source. You will provide this Source Category value when you install the Fastly app.


### Step 2. Configure Endpoint in Fastly for CDN Logs

In this step you add Sumo Logic as a logging endpoint for Fastly services, and configure it to receive CDN logs. The process is described in [Adding Sumo Logic as a logging endpoint](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/streaming-logs/log-streaming-sumologic#adding-sumo-logic-as-a-logging-endpoint) in Fastly help.

If you want to collect CDN and Request WAF logs, see [Collect WAF Request logs](#Step_3:_Collect_WAF_Request_logs) below.

Ensure that the data is sent to Sumo Logic in [Log format version 2](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/streaming-logs/custom-log-formats#upgrading-endpoints-to-use-version-2-log-format). To check the format, see **Determine which log file format you are using** in Fastly help. Note, however, that all new logging endpoints use the version 2 custom log format by default.

When you configure the Sumo Logic endpoint in Fastly:
1. **Name**. Enter a name for the connection. For example, “Prod Fastly”.
2. **Log format**. Use this format string, which generates the necessary JSON output:

3. **Collector URL**. Enter the URL for the HTTP source you created in [Step 1](#Step_1:_Configure_collector_and_source) above.
4. Click **Advanced options**.
5. By default the log line format is set to **Classic**. Change it to **Blank.**
6. Click the **Create** button to create the new logging endpoint.
7. Click the **Activate** button to deploy your configuration.


### Step 3: Collect WAF Request logs

If you have Fastly's Web Application Firewall (WAF), perform these steps to update the configuration of the endpoint you created in [Step 2](#Step_2._Configure_endpoint_for_CDN_logs) above. You are updating the endpoint to receive WAF Request logs as well as CDN logs.

1. Use the JSON object below into the Log format field instead of the one specified in [Configure endpoint in Fastly for CDN logs](#Step_2._Configure_endpoint_in_Fastly_for_CDN_logs).

1. Point the logging endpoint to the `waf_debug_log` subroutine using curl, as described in [waf_debug_log](https://docs.fastly.com/guides/web-application-firewall/fastly-waf-logging#waf_debug_log) in Fastly help.
2. Create a request_id header to track a single request.


### Step 4: Collect WAF Debug Logs

If you have Fastly's Web Application Firewall (WAF), perform these steps to add a second logging endpoint in Fastly and configure it to send WAF request logs to Sumo Logic.

1. Configure another [HTTP Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) for debug logs and set its source category. For example, fastly/debug. Make a note of the Source Category you assign to the source. You will provide this Source Category value when you install the Fastly app.
2. Create another logging endpoint in Fastly following the instructions [Step 2](#Step_2._Configure_Sumo_logging_endpoint_in_Fastly), but enter the JSON below in the **Log format** field.

### Field Extraction Rule

This Field Extraction Rule (FER) is provided as an example to help you reduce your overall parsing time. Note that not all parse operators are supported in FERs. For more information, see Creating a Field Extraction Rule.

```sql
parse "\"reqMethod\":\"*\"" as method, "\"status\":\"*\"" as status, "\"fwdHost\":\"*\"" as origin| parse "\"bytes\":\"*\"" as bytes, "\"edgeIP\":\"*\"" as edgeip, "\"country\":\"*\"" as country, "\"cookie\":\"*\"" as cookie
```

There is a 200 field name limit for Field Extraction Rules (FER) and once a field is persisted using a FER, it can’t be removed. You can assign different targets to the name, but do not create overlapping messages and source categories.
