The Sumo Logic app for Palo Alto Cortex XDR provides comprehensive visibility and analysis of alerts and incidents from the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR platform. Our app empowers your security teams to proactively monitor and respond to security threats, strengthen incident response processes, improve overall security posture, and protect critical assets from advanced threats and attacks.

Key features of the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR app include:
- **Real-Time Monitoring**. Gain real-time visibility into security events and incidents across your organization's infrastructure. Monitor and analyze alerts, threats, and suspicious activities to detect and promptly respond to potential threats.
- **Interactive Dashboards**. Explore interactive dashboards that provide a holistic view of alerts, incidents, and threat intelligence. Visualize data with pre-built charts, graphs, and tables to understand trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Incident Management**. Streamline incident management processes by tracking security incidents. Monitor incident status, and collaborate with your security team for effective incident response.

## Log types

This app uses [Palo Alto Cortex XDR](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/palo-alto-cortex-xdr-source/) source to collect [alerts](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Prevent-Administrator-Guide/Alerts) and [incidents](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Prevent-Administrator-Guide/Incidents) from Palo Alto Cortex XDR.

## Set up collection

Prior to installing the Palo Alto Cortex XDR app, you'll first need to set up the source by following the instructions provided at [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Palo Alto Cortex XDR Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/palo-alto-cortex-xdr-source). By following these steps, you can ensure that your Palo Alto Cortex XDR app is properly integrated and configured to collect and analyze your Palo Alto Cortex XDR data.

## Installing the Palo Alto Cortex XDR app​

This section has instructions for installing the Sumo Logic app for Palo Alto Cortex XDR and descriptions of each of the dashboards.

1. From the **App Catalog**, search for and select the app. If you want to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app before installing, click **Preview Dashboards**.
1. Click **Add Integration**.
1. Configure **Palo Alto Cortex XDR** app using the steps described in the [Palo Alto Cortex XDR Cloud-to-Cloud Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/palo-alto-cortex-xdr-source/). If you already have set up your data, skip this step and click **Next**.
1. Complete the following fields.
   1. **Data Source**. Select either of these options for the data source:
      * Choose **Source Category** and then choose a source category from the list.
      * Select **Enter a Custom Data Filter** and enter a custom source category that starts with an underscore. For example, `_sourceCategory=MyCategory`.
    2. **Folder Name**. You can retain the existing name, or enter a name of your choice for the app.
    3. Select the **Location in Library** (the default is the **Personal** folder in the library), or click **New Folder** to add a new folder.
1. Click **Next**.

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder, or other folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with your organization.

Panels will start to fill automatically. It's important to note that each panel slowly fills with data that matches the time range query and has been received since the panel was created. Results will not be available right away, but with a bit of time, you'll see full graphs and maps.
