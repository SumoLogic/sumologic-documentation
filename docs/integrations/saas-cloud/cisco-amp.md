The Sumo Logic app for Cisco AMP provides security analysts with essential tools to enhance threat detection, conduct thorough investigations, and strengthen cybersecurity defenses. It offers security analysts with a powerful platform for real-time monitoring and analysis of cybersecurity incidents. Analysts can evaluate event severity, identify types of incidents, assess host activities, and analyze file types involved in breaches. 

Additionally, the app highlights the top hosts, users, tactics, and techniques, helping analysts recognize trends and potential risks. With this app, they can examine detection types, review recent malicious files, investigate compromised endpoints, and monitor suspicious processes to respond swiftly to security incidents. The app's geolocation features further enhance analysis by mapping the origins of cybersecurity events and emphasizing activities from restricted areas.
