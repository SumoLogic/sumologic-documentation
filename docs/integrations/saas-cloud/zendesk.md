The Sumo Logic app for Zendesk is designed to provide security analysts with critical visibility into their organization's Zendesk environment. It offers real-time monitoring of audit events, user activity, and security-related changes such as logins, user provisioning, and configuration updates. The app includes dashboards that track the actions of users, groups, and organizations, highlighting potential risks like audits from risky locations or impossible login attempts. 

Security analysts can quickly identify anomalous behavior, unauthorized access, and suspicious activities through detailed visualizations of audit trails and geographic trends. The app's integration with Zendesk ensures seamless tracking of key security metrics, empowering analysts to detect, investigate, and respond to threats promptly. This makes it an essential tool for securing Zendesk environments and ensuring compliance with security policies.
