The Airtable App for Sumo Logic monitors and analyzes your organization's Airtable audit logs, providing insights into user activity, data trends, and security events. This app is based on the Airtable Audit Logs, which provide detailed information on all actions performed in your Airtable account.

The Airtable App makes it simple to import data from your Airtable audit logs into Sumo Logic, where you can perform real-time analysis and build dashboards to visualize key metrics. You can monitor security events and gain insights into user activity across your organization.

The Airtable App allows you to:
* Keep track of user activity within your Airtable account in real-time.
* Analyze user actions, identify failed executions, and track trends over time.
* View a summary of audit logs in table format, enabling you to identify anomalous behavior and potential security threats.
* Create customized dashboards to visualize important metrics and track key performance indicators.

The Airtable App also offers a pre-built dashboard that enables you to start monitoring your Airtable audit logs right away. The Airtable App for Sumo Logic is especially useful for organizations that must comply with regulatory requirements or maintain a high level of security. With the ability to monitor user activity and track changes in real time, you can quickly identify potential issues and respond to security incidents as they occur.

## Log Types

The Sumo Logic App for Airtable consumes Audit logs from your Airtable Enterprise account. Audit Logs track user activity and record changes made to the data in the system.

To understand how to access detailed records of changes made to the Airtable Enterprise account, refer to the [Airtable Audit logs](https://support.airtable.com/docs/how-to-access-enterprise-audit-logs#interpreting-audit-logs) documentation. This documentation provides information on the different types of logs that are available, how to access them, and what information they contain.

## Installing the Airtable App

Before you begin, collect logs from Airtable API and ingest them into Sumo Logic. Refer to the [Airtable API Cloud-to-Cloud Integration](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/airtable-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

{@import ../../reuse/apps/app-install.md}

## Viewing Airtable Dashboardsâ€‹

* All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

 You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

* Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.
