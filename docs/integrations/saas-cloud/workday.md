Workday is a cloud-based ERP system that manages the business processes and allows organizations to use a system integrated application. Workday is a coherent cloud ERP system for financial analysis, analytical solutions, HCM suites, and better business processes.

The Sumo Logic App for Workday provides insights into authentication activity, user activity, and administrator activity. The pre-configured dashboards help identify events that identify compliance and incident reporting, common security events, and real-time analysis of suspicious activities.


## Log Types

The Sumo Logic App for Workday collects all logs in JSON format. It uses the following two types of logs:
* SignOn Logs
* Activity Logs


### Sample Log Messages

Workday App logs are all in JSON format. The Workday App uses two types of logs and this section provides examples of the log types.

```txt title="SignOn Logs"

```



### Sample Query

The query sample provided in this section is from the **Failed Login Reasons** panel of the **Workday - Login Activity** dashboard.

**Parameters**

* `Failed_Signon:*`
* `Authentication_Failure_Message:*`

```sql title="Query String"
_sourceCategory=workday_logs and _sourceName=signonlogs
| json auto

| count by Authentication_Failure_Message
| if (isBlank(Authentication_Failure_Message), "Unknown", Authentication_Failure_Message) as Authentication_Failure_Message
| sort by _count
```

## Before You Deploy

Sumo Logic collects data from the User Activity and Signon Activity Reports via the Workday APIs. Once data collection is set up, the data in the Sumo Logic platform is analyzed via the Workday app in the Sumo Logic app catalog.

User activity data is collected through the Workday Activity Logs API. To ensure that no sensitive information is being sent to Sumo Logic via this report, please run the “User Activity” Report and check the columns (specifically the Target column). If the data contains sensitive info, you can enable data masking for the security group created in the steps outlined below by following the instructions in [this doc](https://doc.workday.com/reader/Z9lz_01hqDMDg6NSf7wCBQ/uHBXsJmAzuJ2QFVU6D3o2w).

## Collecting Logs for the Workday App

This section explains how to collect logs from Workday and ingest them into Sumo Logic for use with the Workday App predefined dashboards and searches.

These instructions assume that the Security Administrator, System Auditor, and Report Administrator security groups are assigned to the user who will be configuring data collection in the Workday portal. Make sure the account used does not belong to an employee otherwise custom reports created by the user may no longer be available when they leave the organization.

Sumo Logic collects logs from Workday via a script that calls the Workday APIs. As part of the script configuration, you need to first configure log types that need to be collected, and these logs are then forwarded to Sumo Logic’s HTTPS source.

By default, the collection starts from the current date and time, but this setting is also configurable. For more information, see the [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) options.

### Recommended Deployment Process

We recommend deploying the Sumo Logic Workday integration using the following guidelines.

1. Start by configuring the collector source as described in the sections below for your Workday Sandbox environment.
2. Once the integration has been successfully deployed and tested in your Workday Sandbox environment, only then should you move to configuring this integration in your Workday production environment.  

If you run into performance issues in your Workday production environment after you've configured integration, file a ticket with Workday to determine what is causing the degradation. Disable the right Sumo Logic Workday collector source if the Workday team determines that it is causing performance problems and then file a support ticket with Sumo Logic to resolve it.

### Step 1: Configure the Workday Portal

This section demonstrates how to configure the Workday portal to integrate with Sumo Logic’s collection scripts. Configuring the Workday portal involves the following steps:

### Step 1.1: Create an Integration System User

1. Access the **Create Integration System User** task and provide the following parameters:
    * **User Name.** SumoLogic_ISU
    * **New Password and New Password Verify.** Enter the password
    * **Do Not Allow UI Sessions.** Check the box
    * **Session Timeout Minutes.** 0 (Disable session expiration)
2. Click **OK**.
3. Exempt the created user from the password expiration rule.
    * Access **Maintain Password Rules** task.
    * Add the users to **System Users exempt from password expiration**.


### Step 1.2: Create a Security Group

1. To create a security group, access the **Create Security Group** task and provide the following parameters:
    * **Type of Tenanted Security Group.** Integration System Security Group (Unconstrained)
    * **Name.** SumoLogic Client Security Group.
1. Click **OK**.
2. In the **Edit Integration System Security Group (Unconstrained)** window provide the following parameters:
    * **Integration System Users**. SumoLogic_ISU
    * **Comment (Optional)**. Provide a short description
3. Click **OK**.
4. To attach the security group to a domain, access the **View Domain** task for the domain System Auditing.
5. Select **Domain > Edit Security Policy Permissions** from the **System Auditing** related **Actions** menu.
6. Add the SumoLogic Client Security Group you created to both the tables as below:
    * **Report/Task Permissions table.** View access
    * **Integration Permissions table**. Get access
7. Click **OK**.
8. To apply policy changes, access the **Activate Pending Security Policy Changes** task and activate the changes you made.
9. Click **OK**.


### Step 1.3: Register the API Client

1. To register the API client, access the **Register API Client** **for Integrations** task, and provide the following parameters:
    * **Client Name.** Sumo Logic Workday Collector
    * **Non-Expiring Refresh Tokens.** Yes.
    * **Scope.** System.
2. Click **OK**.
3. Copy the **Client Secret** and **Client ID** before you navigate away from the page and store it securely. If you lose the **Client Secret,** you can generate a new one using the **Generate New API Client Secret** task.
4. Click **Done**.
5. To generate a refresh token, access the **View API Clients** task and copy the below two parameters from the top of the page:
    * **Workday REST API Endpoint. **The endpoint to use access to the resources in your Tenant.
    * **Token Endpoint**. The endpoint used to exchange an authorization code for a token (if you configure authorization code grant).
6. Go to **API Clients for Integrations **tab hover on **“Sumo Logic Workday Collector API”** client and click on the three-dot action buttons.
7. In the new pop up window, click **API Client** > Manage Refresh Token for Integrations.
8. In the **Manage Refresh Token for Integrations** window, select **“SumoLogic_ISU”** in the **Workday Account** field and click **OK**.
9. In the newly opened window, select **Generate New Refresh Token** checkbox and click **OK**.
10. Copy the value of the **Refresh Token** column from the opened window and click **Done**.


### Step 1.4: Enable your tenant to send data

1. To enable your Tenant to send data, access the **Edit Tenant Setup - System** task and ensure that the **Enable User Activity Logging** checkbox is selected.
2. Access the **Edit Tenant Setup - Security** task and ensure that the **OAuth 2.0 Clients Enabled** checkbox is selected.


### Step 1.5: Create a Custom sign on report

For customers that do not make use of the Recruiting Functional Area, the standard Candidate Signon report may not be available. The alternative is to create a new custom report with **Data Source = “All System Account Signons”** and **Data Source Filter **= **“Workday System Account Signons in Range”**. You can configure the fields using [Excel](https://appdev-readme-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/Workday/Signons_and_Attempted_Signons_-_Copy.xlsx).

1. Go to **Copy Standard Report to Custom Report** task to create a Customs SignOn Report.
2. Select **Candidate Signons and Attempted Signons** in **Standard Report** **Name** dropdown and click **OK**.
3. In the new window, select **Optimized for Performance **checkbox, edit the report **Name** to **Custom Signons and Attempted Signons Report** and click **OK**.
4. In the next window, edit the **Data Source Filter **field and select **Workday System Account Signons in Range **filter.
5. Go to the **Columns** tab and click the **+** button to add the following new fields:
    * Operating System
    * Password Changed
    * Request Originator
    * SAML Identity Provider
    * Forgotten Password Reset Request
    * Multi-Factor Type
    * Is Device Managed
    * UI Client Type
    * Browser Type
    * Device is Trusted
6. Remove the text in the **Column Heading Override** column, for **Field > Session ID** and **Field > System Account**. After configuring all the fields you can verify all the fields using the [Excel](https://appdev-readme-resources.s3.amazonaws.com/Workday/Signons_and_Attempted_Signons_-_Copy.xlsx).
7.  If you're configuring the [Cloud-to-Cloud Collector Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/workday-source/), Go to the **Prompts** tab and look for the **Do Not Prompt at Runtime** column under the **Prompts Defaults** table. Make sure that checkboxes are disabled for the **From_Moment** and **To_Moment** rows.
  <img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/saas-cloud/Workday-SignOn-Report-Prompts-Tab.png')} alt="workday custom sign-on report prompt tab" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} />
8. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click the **Enable As Web Service** checkbox under **Web Service Options**.
9. Go to the **Share** tab, enable **Share with specific users and groups** option, add **SumoLogic_ISU** in the **Authorized Users** field, and click **OK**.
10. Click **Done**. You can also test it by clicking the **Run** button.
11. To get the Report URL, search for **Custom Signons and Attempted Signons Report** in the search bar and run the report.
12. Click the **Actions** button and go to **Web Service > View URLs**.
13. Click **OK** and copy the URL from **JSON** link. You will need this later while configuring the collection.
From the URL, remove any query parameters like json, From Moment and To Moment. The report URL should look like this `https://wd2-impl-services1.workday.com/ccx/service/customreport2/<tenant>/<accountname>/<reportname>`


### Step 2: Add a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source

:::note
This step is not needed if you're configuring the [Cloud-to-Cloud Collector Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/workday-source/).
:::

In this step, you create a hosted collector and HTTP source to receive data from the scripts that collect data from your Workday tenant.

1. Configure a [Hosted Collector](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/configure-hosted-collector), or select an existing hosted collector for the HTTP source.
2. Configure an [HTTP source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/http-source/logs-metrics) on the hosted collector

Make a note of the HTTP address for the source. You will need it when you configure the collection for the Workday scripts in the next step.


### Step 3: Configure Collection for Workday

In this section, we will configure a collection of login and audit logs  from Workday and send them to Sumo Logic via one of the methods listed below.

* For non-FedRamp Sumo Logic deployments, [create a Workday Cloud To Cloud Collector Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/workday-source).
* If you're using the Sumo Logic FedRamp deployment, choose one of the following options:
    * [AWS Lambda based collection](#deploy-the-sumo-logic-workday-sam-application-in-your-aws-environment-deprecated): Use a Sumo Logic Workday collection script to be run in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment using the AWS Lambda service via a Serverless Application Model (SAM) application.
    * [Script-based collection](#configure-script-based-collection-for-workday-deprecated): Run Sumo Logic Python scripts to run periodically on a Linux machine via a cron job.

#### Configure script-based collection for Workday (DEPRECATED)

:::warning solution deprecated

See [Configure the script on a Linux machine](#configure-the-script-on-a-linux-machine) instead.

<details><summary>Learn how to configure script-based log collection for the Sumo Logic Workday App.</summary>

The sumologic-workday script is compatible with python 3.7 and python 2.7, and has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

**Prerequisites**

This task makes the following assumptions:

* You have successfully added a **Hosted Collector** and **HTTP source **and copied configuration parameters (HTTPLogsEndpoint, SignonReportUrl, IntegrationSystemUserPassword, IntegrationSystemUsername,  WorkdayRestApiEndpoint,  RefreshTokenEndpoint, ClientId, ClientSecret, and RefreshToken) from the Workday console, as described in [Add a Hosted Collector and HTTP Source](#step-2-add-a-hosted-collector-and-http-source) section.
* You are logged in to a Linux machine as the user account with which you will install the collector. If not, use the following command to switch to that account: `sudo su <user_name>`

</details>

:::

#### Configure the script on a Linux machine

This task shows you how to install the script on a Linux machine.

* **For python 3**, use:
  ```bash
  pip3 install sumologic-workday
  ```
* **For operating systems where default python is not python3**, use:
  ```bash
  /usr/bin/python3 -m sumoworkdaycollector.main
  ```

To deploy the script on a Linux machine, do the following:
1. If **pip** is not already installed, follow the instructions in the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to download and install **pip**.
2. Log in to a Linux machine (compatible with either Python 3.7 or Python 2.7).
3. Do one of the following:
    * **For Python 2**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install sumologic-workday
     ```
    * **For Python 3**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip3 install sumologic-workday
     ```
4. Create a `sumoworkdaycollector.yaml` configuration file in the home directory and fill in the parameters as shown in the following example.
  ```yml
  SumoLogic:
    HTTP_LOGS_ENDPOINT: <Paste the URL for the HTTP Logs source from step 2.>

  Workday_Report_Config:
    SIGNON_REPORT_URL: <SIGNON REPORT URL from Step 1.i>
    ISU_USERNAME: SumoLogic_ISU
    ISU_PASSWORD: <PASSWORD copied from Step 1.a>
    TIMEOUT: 600
    MAX_FETCH_INTERVAL: 86400
    MIN_FETCH_INTERVAL: 60
    API_CALL_DELAY_SECONDS: 60

  Workday_API_Config:
    AUDIT_API_URL: "/auditLogs"
    WORKDAY_REST_API_ENDPOINT: <Workday Rest API endpoint copied from Step 1.g>
    REFRESH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT: <Token endpoint copied from Step 1.g>
    CLIENT_ID: <API Client ID copied from 1.f>
    CLIENT_SECRET: <API Client SECRET copied from 1.f>
    REFRESH_TOKEN: <Refresh token generated from Step 1.g>
    PAGINATION_LIMIT: 100
    TIMEOUT: 60
    API_CALL_DELAY_SECONDS: 60
    BLACKLIST_TASK_NAMES:
      - "Search in Main Page (Web Service)"
      - "Home"
  ```
5. Create a cron job to run the collector every 5 minutes, (use the `crontab -e` option). Do one of the following:
   * **For Python 2**, add the following line to your crontab:
    ```bash
    */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python -m sumoworkdaycollector.main > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```
   * **For Python 3**, add the following line to your crontab:
    ```bash
    */5 * * * *  /usr/bin/python3 -m sumoworkdaycollector.main > /dev/null 2>&1
    ```


#### Advanced Configuration

This section provides a list of variables for Workday that you can define in the configuration file.

We do not recommend significantly changing how Workday APIs are being invoked by the Sumo Logic collection scripts as these may cause performance problems on your Workday instance.

The Workday specific configuration is shown in below two sections:

* `Workday_Report_Config`. Remove this section to stop collecting SignOn logs from the custom report.
* `Workday_API_Config`. Remove this section to stop collecting audit logs via REST API.

You can view the entire configuration with default settings [here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-workday/blob/master/sumoworkdaycollector/sumoworkdaycollector.yaml). For SAM deployments you can update `sumoworkdaycollector.yaml` file in the AWS Lambda console editor.

The following table provides a list of variables for Workday that you can optionally define in the configuration file.

#### Troubleshooting

This section shows you how to run the function manually and then verify that log messages are being sent from Workday.

To run the function manually, do the following:

1. Enter one of the following commands:
    * For **python**, use: `python -m sumoworkdaycollector.main`
    * For **python3**, use: `python3 -m sumoworkdaycollector.main`
2. Check the automatically generated logs in  **/tmp/sumoapiclient.log **to verify whether the function is getting triggered.
3. If you installed the collector as `root` user and then run it as a normal user, you will see an error message similar to the following because the config is not present in the home directory of the user running the collector. Switch to the `root` user and run the script again.

You can also avoid this error by running the script with config file path as the first argument.

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumoworkdaycollector/main.py", line 190, in main
   ns = WorkdayCollector()
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumoworkdaycollector/main.py", line 29, in __init__
   self.config = Config().get_config(self.CONFIG_FILENAME, self.root_dir, cfgpath)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumoworkdaycollector/common/config.py", line 22, in get_config
   self.validate_config(self.config)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sumoworkdaycollector/common/config.py", line 34, in validate_config
   raise Exception("Invalid config")
Exception: Invalid config
```
