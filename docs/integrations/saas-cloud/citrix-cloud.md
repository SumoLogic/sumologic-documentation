The Citrix Cloud is a platform that manages and hosts various Citrix cloud services. The Citrix Cloud App for Sumo Logic allows you to keep track of any modifications made to configurations or actions that have affected your environment and other account administrators. This app is built on the Citrix Cloud source, which ensures effortless integration between Citrix Cloud and Sumo Logic. Through real-time analysis, the App offers dashboards to display critical metrics, enabling you to understand administrator, client administrator, and group administrator activities within your Active Directory or Azure Active Directory (AD).

## Log Types

This Citrix Cloud App uses [SystemLog](https://developer.cloud.com/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud---systemlog/apis/Records/GetRecords) records from the Citrix Cloud. To learn about the Citrix Cloud API fields, see the [Event Data Fields](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-management/system-log/events.html#event-data-descriptions#fields) documentation.

## Installing the Citrix Cloud App

Before you begin, collect logs from Citrix Cloud API and ingest them into Sumo Logic. Refer to the [Citrix Cloud API Cloud-to-Cloud Integration](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/citrix-cloud-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

## Viewing the Citrix Cloud Dashboards

* All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

 You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

* Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.

**Citrix Cloud - Administrator Overview** dashboard provides detailed information on newly added administrators, pending invitations, and recently deleted administrators from your Citrix Cloud account, including any updates to roles and permissions. The Dashboard also allows for easy visualization of the distribution of event types and the actors who perform these records, enabling you to identify trends and patterns in administrator activity.

In addition to the above, the Dashboard provides a summary of all the Administrator events, allowing you to quickly assess the overall state of your Citrix Cloud account. With this Dashboard, you can easily monitor and analyze administrator activity, ensuring that your Citrix Cloud account remains secure and compliant with your organization's policies and regulations.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/saas-cloud/citrix-admin-overview.png')} alt="citrix-admin-overview" width="750"/>
