The SentinelOne App for Sumo Logic provides security professionals with a comprehensive view of their organization's security posture. The app, based on Sumo Logicâ€™s SentinelOne Source, allows you to quickly ingest data from your SentinelOne agents into Sumo Logic for real-time analysis.

With the SentinelOne App, you can gain valuable insights into your endpoint security data, including threat intelligence, endpoint activity, and system health. You can monitor your endpoints for suspicious behavior and quickly respond to any security incidents that may arise.

The app provides pre-built dashboards that enable you to quickly visualize your SentinelOne data and gain insights into your organization's security posture. You can customize these dashboards to meet your specific needs and monitor the metrics that matter most. With the SentinelOne App for Sumo Logic, you can:
* Ingest data from SentinelOne agents into Sumo Logic for real-time analysis and response
* Monitor your endpoints for suspicious behavior and respond to security incidents in real-time
* Gain valuable insights into your organization's security posture with pre-built dashboards
* Customize dashboards to meet your specific needs and monitor the metrics that matter most to you

In summary, the SentinelOne App for Sumo Logic provides security professionals with the tools they need to monitor and respond to security incidents in real-time, ensuring the protection of their organization's critical assets.

## Log Types

The Sumo Logic App for SentinelOne consumes Threats and Agents logs, refer to the [Threats](https://usea1-partners.sentinelone.net/api-doc/api-details?category=threats&api=get-threats) and [Agents](https://usea1-partners.sentinelone.net/api-doc/api-details?category=agents&api=get-agents) documentation.

## Installing the SentinelOne App

Before you begin, collect logs from SentinelOne and ingest them into Sumo Logic. Refer to the [SentinelOne Cloud-to-Cloud Integration](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/sentinelone-mgmt-api-source/) to create the source and use the same source category while installing the app.

import AppInstall from '../../reuse/apps/app-install.md';

<AppInstall/>

## Viewing SentinelOne Dashboardsâ€‹

* All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top dashboard menu bar to display a scrollable list of filters that are applied across the entire dashboard.

 You can use filters to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. Filters include client country, client device type, client IP, client request host, client request URI, client request user agent, edge response status, origin IP, and origin response status.

* Each panel has a set of filters that are applied to the results for that panel only, as shown in the following example. Click the funnel icon in the top panel menu bar to display a list of panel-specific filters.

### Agent Overview

**SentinelOne - Agent Overview** provides valuable insights related to SentinelOne agents deployed across an organization. The dashboard includes widgets that display key information on the total number of agents, active threats, and infected agents. It also provides information on the distribution of agents by mitigation, machine type, and scan status.

Additionally, the dashboard includes information on the frequency of agents by installer type and the top 10 agents' operating systems and group summary. With this dashboard, security teams can easily monitor the performance of agents and ensure that they are adequately protecting their organization from potential threats.

The SentinelOne Agent Overview enables organizations to quickly identify any issues with agent deployment or performance and take corrective action to improve their overall security posture. It is a powerful tool for any organization looking to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of its threat protection solutions.
