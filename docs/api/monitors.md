The Monitors Management API allows you to manage Monitors from HTTP endpoints. Monitors continuously query your data to monitor and send notifications when specific events occur. For more information see [Monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=10020).


Refer to [Getting Started](docs/api/index.md) for Authentication information and Endpoints.
