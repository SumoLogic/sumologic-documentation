The Archive Ingestion Management API allows you to ingest data from Archive destinations. You can use this API to ingest data from your Archive with an existing AWS S3 Archive Source. You need the Manage or View Collectors role capability to manage or view ingestion jobs. For more information see [Archive](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=10011).
