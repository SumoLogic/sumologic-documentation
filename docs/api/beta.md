## About Sumo Logic APIs

Our APIs are built with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/). You can generate client libraries in many languages and explore automated testing.

Our API documentation is hosted on each Sumo deployment. You need to select the appropriate API documentation link based on which deployment your account is on. Deployments are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. Select the documentation link for your deployment:
