Roles determine the functions that users are able to perform in Sumo Logic. The Role Management API allows you to [manage roles](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Users-and-Roles/Manage-Roles) from HTTP endpoints.

To manage roles, you must have an administrator role or your role must have been assigned the manage users and roles capability. For more information see [Manage Roles](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=5234).

 

Refer to [Getting Started](docs/api/index.md) for Authentication information and Endpoints.
