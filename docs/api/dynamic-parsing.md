The Dynamic Parsing Management API allows you to configure Run Time Field Extraction Rules from HTTP endpoints. Dynamic Parsing allows automatic field extraction from your log messages when you run a search. This allows you to view fields from logs without having to manually specify parsing logic. For more information see [Dynamic Parsing](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=20011).

Refer to [Getting Started](docs/api/index.md) for Authentication information and Endpoints.
