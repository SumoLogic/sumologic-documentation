The User Management API allows you to [manage user accounts](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Users-and-Roles/Manage-Users) from HTTP endpoints. To manage users, you must have the administrator role or your role must have been assigned the manage users and roles capability. For more information see [Manage Users](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=1006).


Refer to [Getting Started](docs/api/index.md) for Authentication and Endpoint information.
