The Service Map API allows you to fetch a graph representation of the Service Map, which is a high-level view of your application environment, automatically derived from tracing data. For more information, see [Service Map](/docs/apm/services-list-map).

:::tip Other Tracing APIs
See also: [Span Analytics APIs](/docs/api/span-analytics) and [Traces APIs](/docs/api/tracing).

Tracing APIs give you the ability to browse and execute queries for traces and span analytics, and request a service map of your application environment.

## Endpoints for API access  

Sumo Logic has deployments that are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. For API access, you must manually direct your API client to the correct Sumo Logic API URL.

See [Sumo Logic Endpoints](/docs/api/about-apis/getting-started#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for the list of the URLs.

An `HTTP 301 Moved error` suggests that the wrong endpoint was specified.
