For example, a parent organization might have child organizations across different deployments. As a result, the [List Organizations API](https://organizations.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/listOrganizations), which lists child organizations, is included in this assembly to accommodate child organizations spread across multiple deployments.</small> |
