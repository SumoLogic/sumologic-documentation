The Collector Management API gives you the ability to manage Collectors and Sources from HTTP endpoints. See the topics below for Collector API and Source API methods and examples, as well as upgrading and downgrading Collectors using the API.

:::caution
Collector Management APIs are not yet built with OpenAPI specifications and therefore not included in our [Swagger docs](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/). Instead, refer to the below documentation.
