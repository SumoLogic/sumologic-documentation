The Ingest Budget Management API allows you to manage **V1** [ingest budgets](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Ingestion-and-Volume/Ingest_Budgets) that have a **Field Value** from HTTP endpoints.

See [V2 API](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Ingest_Budget_Management_API_V2) for management of ingest budgets with a scope.

To manage ingest budgets you must have the **Manage Ingest Budgets** [role capability](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Users-and-Roles/Manage-Roles/05-Role-Capabilities). Enabling this will automatically enable the Manage Collectors capability. The Manage Collectors capability on its own permits the re-assignment of budgets to different Collectors, but not creating or deleting them. For more information see [Ingest Budgets](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Ingestion-and-Volume/Ingest_Budgets).

Refer to [Getting Started](docs/api/index.md) for Authentication information and Endpoints.
