The insight **Summary** pane provides a concise, actionable summary of threat incidents based on triggered signals. It consolidates key details to facilitate quick understanding and response by security teams. The summary is generated by Sumo Logic's Dojo AI Summary Agent, an agentic AI tool.

The summary is generated when an insight is created, and is regenerated whenever the insight is modified, keeping it current with added or removed signals. Summaries are not only generated for insights created by the system, but also custom insights created manually by users via the UI.
