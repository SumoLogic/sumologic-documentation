## Access Cloud SIEM
 
To access Cloud SIEM, in the main Sumo Logic menu select **Cloud SIEM**.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/cse-option-in-left-nav.png')} alt="Cloud SIEM menu option" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="200"/>

Cloud SIEM must be enabled by Sumo Logic before it is accessible to users in your organization. For more information, see [Onboarding Checklist for Cloud SIEM Administrators](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/onboarding-checklist-cse/).

## Theme

<Theme/>

## Heads Up Display

The first screen you see when you access Cloud SIEM is the Heads Up Display, a single pane of information about your environment. In the center, you'll see a radar showing insights, surrounded by the signals and records used to generate the insights. On the left is summary information, and on the right is recent activity. Use this screen as the starting place for your investigations, focusing on insights as the most valuable place to start.

For more information, see [Cloud SIEM Heads Up Display](/docs/cse/get-started-with-cloud-siem/cse-heads-up-display/).
