This section has instructions for deploying the CSE Network Sensor. It covers deployment planning, standard sensor placement, sensor requirements, installation, general configuration, and helpful commands. 

## Network Sensor overview

The CSE Network Sensor is a network security monitor. It uses Zeek, an open source network analysis framework to organize packets into flows, decode common protocols, perform file extraction, SSL certificate validation, OS fingerprinting and more.

The Network Sensor monitors live network traffic, and produces [log files](https://docs.zeek.org/en/current/script-reference/log-files.html) that record a network’s activity in high-level terms. These logs record every connection seen on the wire, and application-layer transcripts, including all HTTP sessions with their requested URIs, key headers, MIME types, and server responses; DNS requests with replies; SSL certificates; key content of SMTP sessions. The log files generated by the sensor are ingested by CSE.

The Network Sensor has a file extraction policy, enabled by default, that saves files observed on the network (unencrypted transfers, e.g. over protocols including SMB and HTTP). Configuration of this policy includes mime-types (exe, zip, pdf, and so on) and maximum extracted file size.

The sensor uses [PF_RING](https://www.ntop.org/products/packet-capture/pf_ring/) for flow-based load balancing across a number of processes that are monitoring/sniffing the same interface.

## Deployment process overview

1. Determine the appropriate location for each sensor, based on anticipated traffic.
1. For each location you designate:
   1. Determine the amount of throughput you will get with this placement.
   1. Use the scaling guide to determine the CPU and memory requirements for the VM or hardware. Confirm that their firewall rules are in place.
   1. Confirm that there is traffic flowing on the interface.
   1. Install the sensor.
1. Confirm the configuration and that data is flowing into the cluster. 

## Network Sensor positioning best practices

Robust network defense is enabled by visibility into events happening on the network. Events affecting digital assets may occur without observable after effects.

CSE helps clients achieve a robust level of network security and surface insights from their environment through the CSE platform and deployed sensors. A number of best practices apply to positioning these sensors for the best results. This section provides detailed guidance on optimal sensor visibility in the most common network environments.

### Position sensor in front of forward proxies

Forward proxies, such as HTTP web proxies, broker client connections to the internet and perform caching and content filtering. Because many threats are hosted on the web and delivered to internal clients by means of drive-by download attacks and similar methods, this outbound web pathway is critically important to security monitoring.

The following diagram Illustrates optimal sensor positioning prior to a web proxy.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/Network_Sensor_Deployment_Guide_SS_1.png')} alt="Network sensor deployment" width="800"/>

Sumo Logic advises positioning network sensors for visibility at a monitoring point immediately in front of the proxy server(s). This allows the sensor to record client source addresses and to see all web requests prior to content filtering. This is an important factor for a number of CSE’s rules and analytics, which rely on knowing the “true” source of requests. Because a number of threats beacon to remote internet servers, seeing even those requests that are filtered by a proxy server is important for monitoring and response.

Positioning the network sensor after a forward proxy is not advised. This placement results in the sensor seeing all traffic sourced from the proxy and complicates (or renders impossible) the ability to determine which assets or users on the LAN were the origin of the traffic.

#### Explicit versus transparent forward proxies and server access logs

Forward proxies may be configured in an environment in either or both of the following ways:

* Explicit. Explicit proxy settings configure clients to use a proxy server for web access. This is often configured by admin policies or by using mechanisms such as proxy auto-configuration (PAC) files or Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Protocol (WPAD).
* Transparent. Transparent proxies intercept outbound web traffic with the assistance of network devices such as firewalls, routers, switches or load balancers, sometimes using Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP) to redirect and balance traffic flows. Clients that are transparently proxied require no configuration as the traffic is proxied upstream when it egresses the network.

In an explicit proxy configuration, clients connect to the proxy server and issue requests. The proxy performs DNS resolution and connects to the remote (origin) server on behalf of the client, meaning the destination IP address for client requests is that of the proxy server rather than the remote server on the internet. In a transparent topology, clients are unaware of the proxy. They perform DNS resolution and attempt to connect to the remote (origin) server directly, meaning the destination IP address in request traffic is that of the remote server. In either case, pre-proxy sensor placement is recommended. A Network Sensor positioned after the proxy server sees the proxy server as the source IP address for all web traffic, masking the identity of
the client.

### Position sensor behind reverse proxies

Reverse proxy servers are positioned in front of web servers and can provide caching, load balancing and request filtering capabilities. Many reverse proxies also provide SSL acceleration services to offload SSL/TLS processing from backend servers. CSE recommends positioning Network Sensor behind reverse proxies, between them and the backend web servers. This positioning allows the sensor to see traffic that is decrypted (allowing it to inspect and collect metadata for the complete request/response) and allows the Network Sensor to collect the true destination address of the backend server behind the proxy. This is particularly useful when large pools of servers exist behind reverse proxies to help identify targeted and affected hosts accurately. Because positioning the sensor behind the reverse proxy causes the network traffic to carry the IP address of the proxy as the source, it is important to send the original client address in the RFC7239 Forwarded extension, X-Forwarded-For header, or whatever related standard is best supported by reverse proxies in the environment.

### Position sensor inside perimeter firewalls and NATs

In all cases, sensor visibility inside of firewalls and NAT devices is advised.

#### Perimeter firewalls

Perimeter firewalls are positioned at an organization’s network border and are often one of the last devices for traffic outbound from an organization or inbound to it from the internet. In both cases, Sumo Logic recommends Network Sensor placement inside the firewall.

For outbound traffic, this ensures that the sensor can see traffic prior to Network Address Translation (NAT) and before any egress filters/ACLs are applied. As is the case with forward proxies, it is important to see outbound communication attempts from hosts on the network even if they are filtered upstream.

The Network Sensor logs every connection attempt observed, even those consisting of only a single TCP SYN packet. For inbound traffic, it is important that the sensor inspects only traffic that is allowed through the firewall filter policy and/or ingress ACLs. Doing so eliminates unimportant internet background noise. It also reduces the amount of traffic inspected, both bits per second (bps) and packets per second (pps), which can reduce load on the Network Sensor. This has a positive effect on log volume. These simple steps make it easier to surface insights on the more meaningful traffic which successfully passes into the environment.

#### NAT Devices

Aside from the devices and configurations described above, similar challenges are presented any time a Network Sensor inspects traffic after application of Network Address Translation. (NAT). NAT may refer to port address translation (PAT), source or destination NATs. In any case that a NAT policy rewrites the source IP address of a connection, it can impact the ability for CSE to analyze and identify affected assets and makes it difficult for operations teams to respond effectively. Sumo Logic  recommends that Network Sensors have visibility in front of NAT.

## Installation requirements

This section describes resource requirements and prerequisites for Network Sensor deployment.

### Host resource requirements

We recommend installing the network sensor on a host with at least two interfaces - one for traffic monitoring and one for management. That way, the sensor doesn't process and upload traffic associated with sensor management for analysis.

The system upon which you install the Network Sensor must have the following resources, at a minimum. Depending on expected throughput, additional core, memory, and storage resources may be required, as shown in [Throughput-dependent resource requirements](#throughput-dependent-resource-requirements)
below. 

| Operating System                   | Cores (CPU) | Memory (RAM) | Storage (Disk) |
|:------------------------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:----------------|
| CentOS 7, or Ubuntu 16, 18, 20 | 4           | 4GB          | 250GB          |

:::note
Before you deploy the network sensor, make sure you know the TAP or SPAN interface upon which captured data is available.
:::

### Prerequisites for CentOS

For CentOS, before running the install command, run these commands as root (or prefix with sudo):

```
yum update -y
yum install -y kernel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r) kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc*
dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)'
dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
yum install -y elfutils-libelf-devel python36
reboot
```

### Throughput-dependent resource requirements

| Throughput Specs | Cores (CPU) | Memory (RAM) | Storage (Disk) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 250mbps | 4 | 4GB | 250GB |
| 500mbps | 5 | 8GB | 250GB |
| 750mbps | 6 | 12GB | 250GB |
| 1gbps | 7 | 16GB | 500GB |
| 1.25gbps | 8 | 20GB | 500GB |
| 1.5gbps | 9 | 24GB | 500GB |
| 1.75gbps | 10 | 28GB | 500GB |
| 2gbps+ | Consult your SE. | Consult SE<br/>(Estimate is 4GB per 250Mbs) | Consult your SE. |

### Outbound Firewall Rules

Ensure that your firewall enables the following outbound traffic, with
these rules:

```
TCP/443 <customername>.portal.jask.ai
TCP/443 <customername>-ingest.portal.jask.ai
TCP/443 34.223.47.64/27
TCP/443 3.122.132.160/27
TCP/443 99.79.83.0/27
```

### Interface considerations

#### Offload Features

Modern network chipsets utilize hardware features to offload work from the host CPU as a performance improvement. Most drivers utilize these features by default These features are often detrimental to the proper functioning of capture interfaces on network sensors.

Verify information about the kernel module (driver) supporting the interface and view offload feature states for the NIC:

```
ethtool -i eno1
ethtool -k eno1
```

A number of NIC offload features should be disabled on capture devices (interfaces that monitor traffic, but not the management interface). An example of interface configuration that disables such features is provided below in [Recommended interface configuration](#recommended-interface-configuration).

#### NIC Hardware Buffer Queue Length

The default size of the ring buffer on many NICs is conservative and in high traffic, scenarios may cause some frames to be dropped before they can be processed. 

Verify the ring parameters for the capture interface(s). The following example shows a maximum RX value of 4096, but an effective setting of
256.

**Input ring buffer queue length**  

```
$ ethtool -g eno1
Ring parameters for eno1:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:         4096
RX Mini:    0
RX Jumbo:   0
TX:         4096
Current hardware settings:
RX:         256
RX Mini:    0
RX Jumbo:   0
TX:         256
```

An example interface configuration which increases the RX ring buffer size is provided below.

#### Recommended interface configuration

The following stanza can be set as an *interface (5)* configuration in Debian or Ubuntu Linux sensors. Most often the file path is `/etc/network/interfaces` (some installations may use a file in `/etc/network/interfaces.d/`). These settings configure the network interface for optimized traffic capture as described above. Similar concepts apply to Red Hat-based distributions using interface setup configurations provided by the distribution.

**/etc/network/interfaces (Debian/Ubuntu)**  

```
iface eno1 inet manual
    # Increase MTU if required for jumbo frames, VLAN tags, etc.
    mtu 1500
    pre-up /sbin/ethtool -G $IFACE rx 4096 tx 0
    pre-up /sbin/ethtool -K $IFACE gro off gso off lro off rx off sg off tso off tx off ufo off
    pre-up /sbin/ethtool -A $IFACE rx off autoneg off
    up ip link set $IFACE arp off allmulticast on
    down ip link set $IFACE down
    post-down /sbin/ethtool -G $IFACE rx 256 tx 256
    post-down /sbin/ethtool -K $IFACE gro on gso on lro on rx on sg on tso on tx on ufo on
    post-down /sbin/ethtool -A $IFACE rx on autoneg on
```

The section below describes the settings configured above. 

#### Interface settings

Link settings

* `arp off` = disable ARP resolution on the interface. The only traffic forwarded to the interface will be a feed from the monitored network segment.
* `allmulticast on` = enable IFF_ALLMULTI. The driver forwards all multicast packets to the kernel for handling.

`-G`

* `rx` = ring entries for Rx; NIC hardware buffer queue length
* `tx` = Tx queue; transmission is not utilized on capture interfaces

`-K`

* `rx` = rx-checksumming; Receive checksumming
* `tx` = tx-checksumming; Transmit checksumming
* `sg` = scatter-gather
* `tso` = tcp-segmentation-offload; TCP segmentation offload
* `ufo` = udp-fragmentation-offload; UDP fragmentation offload
* `gso` = generic-segmentation-offload; generic segmentation offload
* `gro` = generic-receive-offload; generic receive offload
* `lro` = large-receive-offload; large receive offload

`-A`

* `rx` = Rx pause frames; flow control
* `autoneg` = autonegotiation pause frames

## Install the Network Sensor

Download the installer using the download link for your deployment shown on [Sensor Download Locations](/docs/cse/sensors/sensor-download-locations/). Start the installer using the command provided on that page, and then respond to the prompts as described below.

## Uninstall the Network Sensor

1. Before uninstalling the Network Sensor, make sure that the service is stopped: `sudo service trident_sensor stop`
1. To remove the package:

   * On Ubuntu, using `dpkg`: `sudo dpkg -r trident-sensor`
   * On  Ubuntu, using `apt` (removes dependencies): `sudo apt remove trident-sensor`
   * On Centos: `sudo yum remove trident-sensor`

1. Remove remaining configuration and log files: `sudo rm -rf /opt/trident/sensor`

## Network Sensor configuration settings

This section describes the configuration options in the Network Sensor configuration file, ` /opt/trident/sensor/conf/trident-sensor.cfg`.

We strongly recommend that you do not edit  trident-sensor.cfg manually. Instead, you should run `/opt/trident/sensor/bin/configure.sh`, which is
the wizard that runs when you install a Network Sensor. For some configuration options, the wizard updates both `/opt/trident/sensor/conf/trident-sensor.cfg` and `node.cfg`. 

If you do make manual updates to `trident-sensor.cfg`, you must restart the Network Sensor for the changes to take effect with this command:

`sudo service trident_sensor restart`

### api_key

**Description.**  The "Sensor Key", shown on the Add Sensor page in CSE UI

**Default Value.** None

**Configured by wizard?** The wizard prompts you to supply this option value only if you did not supply the URL of a Sumo HTTP Source in response to the earlier prompt. (This is the situation where you are going to send captured data to a legacy CSE server.)

### compression

**Description.** This option controls whether the sensor compresses the bro output files stored in ` /opt/trident/sensor/output/`. By default the sensor does compress the bro files using gzip, when the size of the bro file exceeds the value of the `compression_threshold`. option, described below. To turn compression off, set this option to “no”, or any value other than “gzip”.  Compresses when the parameter is missing or set to gzip and bro output file is above the value set in `compression_threshold`.

**Default Value.** gzip

**Configured by wizard?** No

### compression_threshold

**Description.** Minimum file size for compression.

**Default Value.** 50kB

**Configured by wizard?** No

### debug

**Description.** The sensor writes messages about the upload process, that is, the process of uploading captured data to Sumo Logic or the CSE server.

When Records per second is below this threshold for a status report interval (default is 5 minutes) the report will be counted towards [no_data_restart_threshold](#no_data_restart_threshold). Use this parameter to tune automatic restarts of the Network Sensor when no data is being captured/reported (requires `no_data_restart_threshold` to be set, the recommended value for this parameter is 3, as described below ).

**Default value.** 3

**Configured by wizard?** No

### no_data_restart_threshold

**Description.** Number of consecutive status reports with no data that should trigger a restart of the Network Sensor. This may be enabled to handle Zeek out-of-memory issues that causes capturing to stop occasionally. Recommended number to start with is 3 (a single status report with no data is normal).

```

### Sample node.cfg file (cluster configuration file)

The `/opt/trident/sensor/bro/etc/node.cfg` file is automatically generated, based on the choices you make when running the configuration wizard at installation time. 

Typically you should not edit `node.cfg` without consulting CSE support. Under some circumstances, edits may be necessary, for example, if you want to monitor more than one capture interface.

If you do make manual updates to `node.cfg`, you must restart the Network Sensor for the changes to take effect with this command:
`sudo service trident_sensor restart`

This section contains Linux command for working with the sensor and its configuration files.

```
# Restart sensor
$ systemctl restart trident_sensor

# Sensor status
$ systemctl status trident_sensor

# Standard Performance check 1
$ top

# Bro Control Access
$ sudo /opt/trident/sensor/bro/bin/broctl # then you can run `help` to see all commands

# View Trident Config
$ cat /opt/trident/sensor/conf/trident-sensor.cfg

# Edit Trident Config
$ vi /opt/trident/sensor/conf/trident-sensor.cfg

# View Node Config
$ cat /opt/trident/sensor/bro/etc/node.cfg

# Edit Node Config
$ vi /opt/trident/sensor/bro/etc/node.cfg

# View Logs
$ tail -f /opt/trident/sensor/logs/trident-sensor.log

# View Data Flow Logs
$ tail -f /opt/trident/sensor/logs/trident-shipper.log

# View Outputs
$ ls -lh /opt/trident/sensor/output/

# TCPDump to verify the monitoring interface is seeing traffic
$ sudo tcpdump -c 20 -i <<interface name>>     Or    $ sudo tcpdump -c 20 -i <<interface name>> port 80
```

## Troubleshooting

### Interface status 

If an Ubuntu VM (possibly other Linux distributions) does not show both interfaces (one for traffic monitoring and one for management) that have been assigned when using the `ifconfig` command, but does show both interfaces when running an `ip link show` then the second interface is not currently in an UP state.   
   
You can temporarily put the interface in the UP state, using the following command:

`$ ip link set\<<interface name\>> up`  
   
To make the UP state persist through a reboot or service restart, edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file with your choice of editor.  Remember to use sudo. Add the following line to this file:  
   
`auto\<<interface name\>>`  
   
After you save this file, clear any existing IPs from the interface by running:  
   
`$ sudo ip addr flush\<<interface name\>>`

### Troubleshoot Bro/Zeek

Diagnose issues with Bro/Zeek using the following command:

`/opt/trident/sensor/bro/bin/broctl diag`

The output of this command shows any fatal errors observed when one or more workers crashed.

There’s also a `crash-diagscript` you can run for the node that had an issue (The output below is from intentionally crashing Bro worker-0-1 node with an invalid pcap filter):

```
[root@localhost ~]# /opt/trident/sensor/bro/share/broctl/scripts/crash-diag /opt/trident/sensor/output/worker-0-1/
