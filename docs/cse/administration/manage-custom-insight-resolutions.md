This topic has information about custom Insight resolutions and how to create and manage them.

## About Insight resolutions

When you close an Insight, Cloud SIEM prompts you to select a resolution that indicates why you closed it. There are four built-in resolutions:

* Duplicate — The insight has triggered before on the same entity and is a duplicate.
* False Positive—An insight triggered and it is legitimate activity.
* No Action—An insight triggered and it might not be an incident but is also not a false positive.
* Resolved — An incident occurred and was resolved.

You can define custom *sub-resolutions* for any of the built-in resolutions. This enables you to create more granular resolutions that indicate more clearly why an Insight was closed. For example, you might want to create a “Remediated” sub-resolution under “Resolved”.

## Create a custom sub-resolution

1. Click **Configuration** in the menu, and under **Workflow** choose **Resolutions**.
1. On the **Insight Resolutions** page, click **Create**. 
1. The **Create Insight Resolution** page appears.
    1. **Name**. Enter a meaningful name for the new resolution.
    1. **Parent Resolution**. Display the dropdown list and select a built-in resolution.
    1. **Description**. (Optional) Enter a description that will help other users understand when to use the new resolution.
    1. Click **Create**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/create-insight-resolution.png')} alt="Create Insight resolution" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
    1. The new resolution appears on the **Insight Resolutions** page, indented below the parent resolution. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/resolutions-list-with-new.png')} alt="Insight resolutions list" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

## Close an Insight using a custom resolution

1. After navigating to an Insight, you can close it by either clicking the **Close Insight** button or by selecting **Closed** from the **Status** pulldown.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/close-options.png')} alt="Close options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. The **Close Insight** popup presents a list of resolutions, including any custom sub-resolutions that have been defined. Note that a custom resolution is indented below its parent built-in resolution. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/resolution-options-2.png')} alt="Close Insight" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. Click the appropriate resolution for the Insight.
1. A popup appears where you can add a comment if desired. Click **Close Insight** to apply the selected resolution and close the Insight. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/confirm-close.png')} alt="Confirm close" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>

## Filter Insights by custom resolution

You can filter Insights by custom resolution.

1. On the **Insights** page, check the **Filters** area and make sure that the **Status** filter is not set to “is not closed”.  
1. Click in the **Filters** area and select **Custom Resolution**.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/filter-option.png')} alt="Filter options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. You’re prompted to select an operator: **is** or **is not**.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/operators.png')} alt="Operators" width="400"/>
1. After you choose an operator, you're prompted to select a custom resolution.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/custom-resolution-options.png')} alt="Custom resolution options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. Select a resolution to view Insights that have that resolution.  <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/search-results.png')} alt="Search results" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
