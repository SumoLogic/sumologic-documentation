This page has information about accessing the CSE APIs and API documentation.

Your API endpoint depends on your Sumo Logic deployment. For a list of Sumo Logic API endpoints by deployment, see Sumo Logic Endpoints and Firewall Security. Your endpoint will look something like this:

`https://api.us2.sumologic.com/api/`

To view API documentation, go to the `/docs/sec` path at your API endpoint. For example:

`https://api.us2.sumologic.com/docs/sec/`

The APIs themselves start with `/api/sec/v1/`

For example:  

`https://api.us2.sumologic.com/api/sec/v1/custom-insights`

API requests must be authenticated. For authentication options and information about rate limiting, see API Authentication.Â
