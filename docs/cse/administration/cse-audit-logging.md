import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The [Audit Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/audit-event-index/) and [System Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/system-event-index/) provide event logs in JSON format on your account activity so you to monitor and audit changes. By default the Audit Event Index and System Event Index are enabled for Cloud SIEM and Enterprise accounts.

:::note
This page describes functionality that is available to users whose Cloud SIEM URL ends in `sumologic.com`.

## Where to find documentation  

To learn more, see [Cloud SIEM audit log definitions](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/documentation-audit-log-definitions/#cloud-siem-audit-log-definitions).


## Scoping your search

This section explains how to scope a search of the Audit Event Index and System Event Index to return Cloud SIEM events.

## Limit search to user or system events

Cloud SIEM audit events are stored in two Partitions:

* `sumologic_audit_events`. This index contains user action events, which are events that were triggered by a user action, either from the UI or an API. For example, a user created an insight from a signal using the Cloud SIEM UI.
* `sumologic_system_events`. This index contains system action events, which are events that were triggered by the system. For example, an insight was generated by Cloud SIEM.

Use `_index=sumologic_audit_events` to limit results to events related to user actions

Use  `_index=sumologic_system_events` to limit results to events related to system actions.

## Limit search to Cloud SIEM events

You can use the `subsystem` field, which every event log contains, to limit the events returned to Cloud SIEM-related events:

`subsystem=cse*`

For information about other fields you can use in Audit Index searches, see auto-generated documentation at the documentation URL for your deployment.

## Limit search by Cloud SIEM feature

The table below shows the `_sourceCategory` that is assigned to event logs by Cloud SIEM feature.

## _sourceName and _sourceHost assignment

The `_sourceName` and `_sourceHost` fields are assigned to audit event
logs as follows.

| Metadata Field | Assignment Description |
|:--|:--|
| `_sourceName` | Value of the common parameter, `eventName`. |
| `_sourceHost` | The remote IP address of the host that made the request. If not available the value will be `no_sourceHost`. |

## Common parameters

Each audit event log has common keys that categorize it to a product
area and provide details of the event.

| Parameter | Description | Data Type |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `accountId` | The unique identifier of the organization. | String |
| `eventId` | The unique identifier of the event. | String |
| `eventName` | The name of the event. | String |
| `eventTime` | The event timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. | String |
| `eventFormatVersion` | The event log format version. | String |
| `operator` | Information of who did the operation. If it's missing, the Sumo service was the operator. | JSON object of Strings |
| `subsystem` | The product area of the event. | String |

## Search for Cloud SIEM events 

To search the Audit Event Index or System Event Index for logs that describe Cloud SIEM events:

1. Start a [log search](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/about-search-basics/). 
2. In the search tab, enter a search using `_index` to specify the partition you want to search, and other metadata or fields to further scope your search. For example:  
    ```sql
    _index=sumologic_system_events
    | json auto
    | where subsystem="cse*"
    ```
3. Choose the time range for your search.
4. Click **Start** to run the search.

## Example event log

Here is an example `InsightCreated` event log.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/cse/example-event.png')}  alt="Example event log" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600" />

## Index retention period 

By default, the retention period of the Audit Event Index is the same as the retention period of your Default Partition. You can change the retention period by editing the relevant partitions, `sumologic_audit_events` and `sumologic_system_events`. For more information, see [Create and Edit a Partition](/docs/manage/partitions/data-tiers/create-edit-partition).
