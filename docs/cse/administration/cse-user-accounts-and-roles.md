description: Learn how to create users and roles for CSE.
---

This topic has information about creating and managing user accounts and roles for CSE. CSE uses role-based access control (RBAC). An administrator controls access to capabilities by assigning capabilities or permissions to roles, and then assigning users to roles.  

The process and UI for setting users and roles depends on your CSE environment. 

* If your CSE URL ends in `sumologic.com`, you’ll set up users and roles in the Sumo Logic platform UI. For instructions, see the following help topics:
    * [Create and Manage Roles](../../manage/users-and-roles/roles/create-manage-roles.md)  The Sumo Logic platform allows you to assign multiple roles to a user. So, you might consider creating CSE-specific roles for different CSE user types, separate from roles you may define for Sumo Logic platform functionality. The CSE-related capabilities you can assign to roles are listed in the Cloud SIEM Enterprise section of the *Role Capabilities* page. 

        :::note
        When you create roles in the Sumo Logic platform, you have the option to set up a role search filter that specifies what log data users with the role may access. If you take advantage of that feature, be sure not to restrict CSE users’ access to [indexes that contain CSE Records](../records-signals-entities-insights/search-cse-records-in-sumo.md).

    * [Create and Edit Users](../../manage/users-and-roles/users/create-edit-users.md)
* If your CSE URL ends in `jask.ai`, you’ll set up user accounts and roles in the CSE UI. Follow the instructions below.

## Invite a user

These instructions apply if your CSE URL ends in `jask.ai`.

1. Click the gear icon, and choose **Accounts** under **Users**.   
    ![accounts-link.png](/img/cse/accounts-link.png)
1. On the **Accounts** page, click **Invite**.  
    ![invite-link.png](/img/cse/invite-link.png)
1. The **Invite Users** popup appears.  
    ![invite-users.png](/img/cse/invite-users.png)
1. **Emails**. Enter one or more email addresses. If you enter more than one address, separate them by commas.  
1. **Role**. Use the down-arrow to view a list of roles, and choose one. You can view the permissions associated with available roles on the  **Roles** page. (Click the gear icon, and choose **Roles** under **Users**.) 
1. Click **Invite**. 

The individuals you invite will be sent an email with a link to the CSE
UI, like the one shown below.

When the invitee accesses the CSE UI, they’ll be prompted to select a CSE username and password.  

## Create a role in CSE

A CSE role has a set of permissions associated with it. Users with that role have the permissions assigned to the role. 

To create a role:

1. Click the gear icon, and choose **Roles** under **Users**.   
    ![roles-link.png](/img/cse/roles-link.png)
1. The **Roles** page appears, and lists the roles that are already  defined. There are two built-in roles that cannot be deleted or edited: Administrator and Analyst. The avatar for each user that has the role is shown―hover over it to see the user's name and username.

1. Click **Create**.
1. The **Create Role** popup appears.

1. **Name**. Enter a name for the role.
1. **Permissions**. Checkmark each permission you want to assign to the role. For a description of each permission, see [Role Permissions](#role-permissions), below.
1. Click **Create**.
