Cloud SIEM Enterprise (CSE) is a cloud-based SIEM that provides the following functionality:Â 

* Collection of log and event data from your infrastructure and
    applications, on-premise and in-cloud.
* Correlation of the collected data to reduce the volume of info
    you need to sift through to investigate issues.
* A rich interface that analysts and admins can use to investigate
    security issues and administer CSE itself.
* Integration with the Sumo Logic platform.
