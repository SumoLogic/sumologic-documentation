This topic has instructions for find the log mappers that CSE provides for particular product or service.

CSE may have more than one log mapping for a particular product. For example, there may be a separate mapping for each message type issued by a product. You can view the available mappings in the CSE UI.

1. In the CSE UI, click the gear icon and select **Log Mappings**.   <br/>  ![config-gear-mappings.png](/img/cse/config-gear-mappings.png)
1. In the **Filters** area, filter by **Output Vendor**, **Output Product**, or both. In the following screenshot, the list of mappings is filtered to display mappings for *Output Vendor is Proofpoint*. The list contains six mappings for two Proofpoint products: five for Targeted Attack Protection, and one for Proofpoint On Demand.    <br/>  ![proofpoint-log-mappers.png](/img/cse/proofpoint-log-mappers.png)
