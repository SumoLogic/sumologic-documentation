The Cloud SIEM schema is the data model in which data is normalized and enhanced. When logs are processed, their data is mapped to a set of standard schema attributes (for example, for IP addresses, usernames, host names, and the like). In this way, information from logs provided by different vendors is normalized into a standard set of data that can be analyzed in Cloud SIEM. 

For the complete list of Cloud SIEM schema attributes, see [Schema: Full Schema](https://github.com/SumoLogic/cloud-siem-content-catalog/blob/master/schema/full_schema.md) in the [Cloud SIEM Content Catalog](https://github.com/SumoLogic/cloud-siem-content-catalog/blob/master/README.md).
