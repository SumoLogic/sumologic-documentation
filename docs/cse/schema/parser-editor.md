description: Learn how to use the Parser Editor to configure and test a custom parser.
---

This topic has instructions for using the Sumo Logic parser editor. You can use the editor to customize system parsers, and to create your own custom parsers.

For information about the Sumo Logic CSE parsing language, see [Parsing Language Reference Guide](parsing-language-reference-guide.md).

:::note
The instructions that follow assume that you have already written your parser code.

## Check parser code for mapping hints

Your parser code must contain statements that tell CSE what log mapping to use when creating Records from the field dictionary the parser creates for log messages. 

Make sure your parser code includes `MAPPER` statements that specify the vendor, product, and the event ID that the log messages to be parsed contain, and a `FORMAT` statement that defines the message format.

* `MAPPER:vendor`—Use this statement to identify the vendor that supplies the product. For example: `MAPPER:vendor = AWS`.   
* `MAPPER:product`—Use this statement to identify the product whose logs will be parsed by your parser. For example: `MAPPER:product = CloudTrail`.   
* `MAPPER:event_id`—Use this statement to specify the event ID to assign to parsed events. For some log messages this is a constant, for example, for a Windows Event: `MAPPER:event_id = Security-4624`. In other cases, you may need to form the event ID from fields contained in log messages. In that case, you can define an event ID pattern. For example: `MAPPER:event_id = {{eventType}}-{{eventName}}`.
* `FORMAT`—Use this statement to specify the format of the log messages to be parsed. For example: `FORMAT = JSON`.

## Configure and test a custom parser

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Logs** > **Parsers**.<br/>  ![add-button.png](/img/cse/add-button.png)
1. Navigate to the folder where you’d like to create the parser. If you want to create a new folder, click **Add** and select **New Folder**.  You don’t have to organize your parsers in folders, but it's easier to manage them if you do.
1. Click **Add** and select **New Parser** to display the **Create Parser** page.<br/>  ![create-parser-annotated.png](/img/cse/create-parser-annotated.png)
1. **Name**. Enter a distinctive name for the parser. Typically the parser name indicates the product or service whose messages it will parse.
1. **Description**. (Optional) Describe the parser.
1. **Parser Configuration**. Paste your parser code in this area.
1. **Import Messages from**. In this step, you enter or fetch messages that you’ll use to test whether the parser parses the messages correctly. There are three options:
   * **Sumo Log Search**. You can enter a log search query to obtain a selected number of log messages. Follow the instructions in [Using Sumo log search](#using-sumo-log-search) below.
   * **Saved Logs**. You can select a set of messages that you saved when previously using the **Paste Logs** option. Follow the instructions in [Using saved logs](#using-saved-logs) below.
   * **Paste Logs**. You can paste logs directly into the **Log Messages** area. Follow the instructions in [Using paste logs](#using-paste-logs) below. 

### Parse Logs

1. After you’ve obtained sample messages using one of the methods above, click **Parse Logs**.
1. If all of the sample messages are parsed successfully, you’ll see results like those shown below in the **Parsed Messages** section of the editor. The **Event Details** section shows the key-value pairs that were parsed from the raw message. If your results indicate that there were warnings, unparsed, or dropped messages, see [Understanding parsing failures and warnings](#understanding-parsing-failures-and-warnings).<br/>  ![successsful-blurred.png](/img/cse/successsful-blurred.png)

1. Once your new parser is working, and you want to start using it, follow the instructions in [Configuring a source to use a parser](#configure-and-test-a-custom-parser).

## Get sample messages

This section describes the three methods of obtaining messages for use in testing your parser.

### Using Sumo log search

To import messages by running a Sumo Logic search:

1. Choose the **Sumo Log Search** option to display this popup.<br/>  ![search-for-sample-logs.png](/img/cse/search-for-sample-logs.png)
1. Enter a log query, time range, the number of messages you want returned, and click **OK**.
1. The popup now displays the results of your search.<br/>  ![messages-returned.png](/img/cse/messages-returned.png)
1. Click **OK** to close the popup.
1. The **Sample logs** portion of the parser editor now contains the sample messages. 
1. Proceed to [Parse logs](#parse-logs).

### Using paste logs

To import messages by pasting them in the editor:

1. Choose the **Paste Logs** option to display this popup.<br/>  ![paste-in-sample-logs.png](/img/cse/paste-in-sample-logs.png)
1. **Raw Logs**. Paste your log messages into this area.
1. **Breaker**. Use this option to tell the parser editor how to split the text you entered into messages. The options are:
   * **Line \\n**. Choose this option to break the text at line breaks.
   * **JSON**. Choose this option for JSON messages.
   * **Custom Regex**. Choose this if you want to use a regex to define the split. The popup will refresh and prompt you for the regex.
1. Click **Break Messages**.
1. The popup refreshes and shows how the pasted text was broken into individual messages. Review the messages to verify they were split correctly.<br/>  ![after-split.png](/img/cse/after-split.png)
1. Click **OK** to close the popup. The **Sample logs** portion of the parser editor now contains the sample messages. Note the **Save Messages As** option. You can save the messages you just broke up for use in any additional testing of the parser that you may need to do.<br/>   ![save-messages-link.png](/img/cse/save-messages-link.png)
1. To save the message, click the **Save Messages As** option.
1. On the **Save Messages** popup, enter a name for the saved messages, and click **Save.**
1. Proceed to [Parse logs](#parse-logs).

### Using saved logs

To import previously saved messages:

1. Click **Saved Logs** in the **Sample Logs** section of the editor. This popup appears:<br/>  ![get-saved-messages.png](/img/cse/get-saved-messages.png)
1. Select a saved file of sample messages from the list in the **File Name** section of the popup.
1. The messages from the selected file appear in the **Preview Logs** section of the page.
1. Click **Get Logs**.
1. The popup closes and the logs that you retrieved now appear in the **Sample Logs** section of the editor.<br/>  ![messages-from-saved-file.png](/img/cse/messages-from-saved-file.png)
1. Proceed to [Parse logs](#parse-logs).

## Understanding parsing failures and warnings

When you test your parser, the editor presents a count of how many
messages were successfully parsed, and the counts of messages in the
following categories:

* Parsed messages with warnings—A warning or error occurred but the message was was partially parsed, depending on where the warning or error occurred. The most common cause of a warning is applying a [RENAME_FIELD](parsing-language-reference-guide.md) statement to a field that isn't present in the message.
* Unparsed messages—An error occurred that caused parsing to fail. Potential causes of parsing failures include:

  * An unmatched regex.
  * Invalid XML, when using XML parsing.
  * Invalid JSON parsing, when using JSON parsing.
  * Fewer CSV fields in the message than expected. 
  * Attempting a transform on a field that doesn't exist unless you use [TRANSFORM_FIELD_IF_PRESENT](parsing-language-reference-guide.md).

* Dropped messages—The message was dropped due to a [DROP](parsing-language-reference-guide.md statement in the parser. 

## Create a local configuration for a system parser

You can customize any of the system parsers that are built into CSE. When you open an system parser for editing, you'll see its code in the **System Configuration** section. For a system parser, the UI also provides an area for entering your customizations — that's the part of the page labeled **Local Configuration**. The [parsing language statements](parsing-language-reference-guide.md) you enter there will be executed in addition to the those in the system configuration. If a statement you add to the system configuration already exists in the system configuration, the local statement will override the system statement. For example, if the system configuration has:

`START_TIME_FIELD = eventTime`

and the local configuration has:

`START_TIME_FIELD = _messagetime`

the local statement overrides the system statement.

Here is an example of a local configuration that overrides the `START_TIME_FIELD` and `TIME_PARSE `statements.

![local-config.png](/img/cse/local-config.png)

The system configuration and local configuration are separate, so your customizations are preserved when Sumo Logic updates the parser.

### Use cases for local configuration

You can use a local configuration to override any statement in a system parser, and add additional logic to the parser using any of the statements supported by the parsing language.

One use case for a local configuration to override one or more of a parser’s time handling statements. For example, if the logs to be parsed don’t have a timestamp, you could set [START_TIME_FIELD](parsing-language-reference-guide.md) = `_messagetime`. This causes the Sumo Logic core platform message time to be used as the `_starttime` in the field dictionary your parser creates from a message. Or, if the time formats in the logs to be parsed don't exactly match the format that a system parser assumes, you use a local configuration to specify a different [TIME_PARSER](parsing-language-reference-guide.md) setting.

Another common reason to set up a local configuration is to pre-parse the content of a JSON object. If your parser is going to process an encapsulated JSON object, you can use a local configuration to pre-parse the original log message from the object.

To create a local configuration:

1. Go to **Manage Data** > **Logs** > **Parsers**.
1. In the System folder, navigate to the parser you want to modify and choose **Edit** from the three-dot more options menu.<br/>  ![three-dot.png](/img/cse/three-dot.png)
1. The parser editor opens. The parser code is shown in the **System Configuration** area.<br/>  ![system-parser-edit- button.png](/img/cse/system-parser-edit-button.png)
1. Paste your custom parser code in the **Local Configuration** area.
1. Use one of the methods in **Get test messages** above, and then click **Parse Logs**.

## Move a parser

You can move a parser from one location to another within the parser editor’s folder structure. To do so, navigate to the parser you want to move, and select **Move** from the three-dot more options menu. 

## Export and import a parser

You can export a parser as JSON, and import it to another Sumo Logic
org.

1. Navigate to the parser you want to export and choose **Export** from the three-dot more options menu.
1. On the **Export** popup, click **Copy to Clipboard** and then click **Done**.<br/>  ![export.png](/img/cse/export.png)
1. Access the Sumo Logic org where you want to import the parser.
1. Go to **Manage Data > Logs > Parsers**.
1. Navigate to the folder where you want to store the parser.
1. Choose **Import** from the three-dot more options menu.
1. Enter a name for the parser, paste the code you exported into the popup, and click **Import**.<br/>  ![import.png](/img/cse/import.png)

## Setting CSE log mapping information

In this step you configure one or more Log Mappings. If all of the messages your parser will process contain the same fields, and you want to create Records of the same type, a single Log Mapping will suffice. For some data sources, you will likely need to create more than one Log Mapping. For example:

With some CloudTrail logs messages, you might want to create a different [Record type](cse-record-types.md), depending on the event ID in a message. In some cases, an Authorization Record is appropriate, while in others, an Audit or Audit Change Record would be a better fit. 

In some CloudTrail messages, the field mapping (the mapping between a key in the field dictionary and a CSE Record) will vary, depending on the Event ID in the message. For example, you may want to map data into the CSE schema field action, but the data you want to map is located in different keys of the original CloudTrail JSON messages depending on the CloudTrail event type.

To create your mapping, see [Creating a Structured Log Mapping](create-structured-log-mapping.md). After setting up the mapping or mappings, complete the steps in [Configuring a source to use a parser](#configuring-a-source-to-use-a-parser), below.

## Configuring a source to use a parser

This section explains how to configure a Sumo Logic core platform source to send the messages it collects to a parser. This involves configuring a Field for the source: you'll create a `_parser` Field that defines the path to the parser. 

1. Navigate to your custom parser in the editor.
1. Hover over the row that contains the parser.<br/>  ![more-options-for-parser.png](/img/cse/more-options-for-parser.png)
1. Click the three-dot more options icon, and select **Copy Path** and save the path.
1. In Sumo Logic core platform, go to **Manage Data** > **Collection** > **Collection**.
1. Navigate to the source that produces the messages your custom parser will process.<br/>  ![cloudtrail-source.png](/img/cse/cloudtrail-source.png)
1. Click **+Add Field**. 
1. Two blank fields appear, below any Fields that have already been defined for the source. Enter `_parser` as the field name and the path to your parser as the value. <br/>![new-field.png](/img/cse/new-field.png) An orange icon indicates that the `_parser` field has not been created in your Sumo Logic core platform org yet.
