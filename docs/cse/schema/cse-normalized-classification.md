---



This topic describes how CSE applies normalized classification to Records. 

In CSE Records can be classified at two levels. First, all Records are classified at a high level by Record Type. At a more detailed level, you can classify more specifically using Normalized Classification Fields alongside the mapped attributes within a Record.

## Record Types

Every CSE Record has a Record Type. A Record Type classifies the nature of the event that the Record describes. CSE Record Types include **Authentication,** **Endpoint**, **NetworkHTTP** and so on.

A Record’s type is set by the [log mapping](/docs/cse/schema/create-structured-log-mapping) that processes it. For more information, see [CSE Record Types](/docs/cse/schema/cse-record-types).

## Normalized Classification Fields

For more granular classification of a Record, CSE uses *Normalized Classification Fields*. These are special normalized schema fields that have an enforced output defined by CSE. These fields provide a taxonomy that can be used to tie Records from multiple vendors and products together in a standard way. Rather than holistically trying to describe a Record as Record Type does, these fields exist alongside commonly used normalization schema fields which most often contain the what, where, and why of a particular Record. This allows for far more dynamic and specific classification of a Record than Record Type alone. 

Normalized Classification Fields are completely optional when creating a log mapping. When using Normalized Classification Fields, it is best to consider whether a parallel normalized schema field exists for the Record and whether there is an analogous enforced output available in the desired Normalized Classification Field. These fields will most typically utilize the lookup unless the vendor log output exactly matches the enforced outputs or a constant value is assigned.

:::note
* When creating a log mapping, if the output value used for a given Normalized Classification Field is not listed in the Enforced Output Values for that field, it will not be populated.
* Normalized Classification Fields are a new feature and will be backfilled to existing out-of-the-box mappings over time.

## normalizedAction

Complementary to the [action](/docs/cse/schema/schema-attributes) field, the `normalizedAction` field describes the initiation of an activity in a
standard way across Records. `normalizedAction` is meant to describe an attempt to perform an action, using the success boolean as a modifier to indicate whether or not the action was successful. Note that `normalizedAction` should be used with [normalizedResource](/docs/cse/schema/cse-normalized-classification) to indicate where an action was attempted, or the resource or entity upon which the action was attempted.

## normalizedCause

Complementary to the [cause](/docs/cse/schema/schema-attributes) field, this field describes the reason for any particular outcome in a Record in a standard way.

|  Enforced Output Value |  Description |
|:--|:--|

### success

True or false showing whether or not an action or event Recorded in a log was successful. This field is either defined as a constant or based on a lookup in a mapping.

## normalizedSeverity

Severity score on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being informational and 10 being critical. This is defined either explicitly per mapping or by a lookup to normalize a vendor specific severity level. Certain normalized threat rules will use normalizedSeverity to pass a dynamic severity into the signal.
