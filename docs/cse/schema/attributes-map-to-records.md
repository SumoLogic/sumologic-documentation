You can map schema attributes to records. Note that you can map any of the attributes defined to any [record type](/docs/cse/schema/cse-record-types). 

For the complete list of attributes you can map to records, see [Schema: General Schema Fields](https://github.com/SumoLogic/cloud-siem-content-catalog/blob/master/schema/general_fields.md) in the [Cloud SIEM Content Catalog](https://github.com/SumoLogic/cloud-siem-content-catalog/blob/master/README.md).

For information about all schema attributes, including those that cannot be mapped to records, for example enrichment fields, see [Schema Attributes](/docs/cse/schema/schema-attributes).
