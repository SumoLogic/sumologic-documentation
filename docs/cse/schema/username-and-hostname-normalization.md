This topic describes how CSE normalizes usernames and hostnames in Records during the parsing and mapping process. This allows for common name forms among Active Directory, AWS, and fully qualified domain names to be normalized into a domain and username form.

## Details

The name normalization process normalizes a complete username into a base username and a domain. The following forms of usernames are
normalized.

Some of the common forms for username are:

* `username` (no domain)
* `AD-DOMAIN\username`
* `username@AD-DOMAIN.X` (the AD domain format that’s more fully qualified)
* `username@EMAIL-DOMAIN` (FQDN)
* `arn:aws(-us-gov)?:iam::<USER_ID>:user/username` or `arn:aws(-us-gov)?:iam::<USER_ID>:user/username@FQDN`
* `AROA<AWS_ID>:username@FQDN` or `arn:aws:iam::<USER_ID>:user/username@FQDN`

Some of the common forms of hostname are:

* `hostname` (no domain)
* `AD-DOMAIN\hostname`
* `hostname@AD-DOMAIN.X` and `hostname$@AD-DOMAIN.X`
* `hostname.DOMAIN` (or `EMAIL-DOMAIN`)

The following fields of the schema are normalized.

| Schema Attribute     | Normalization Type |
|:----------------------|:--------------------|
| `device_hostname`    | hostname           |
| `dstDevice_hostname` | hostname           |
| `fromUser_username`  | username           |
| `srcDevice_hostname` | hostname           |
| `user_username`      | username           |

When a username is normalized, the original, un-normalized name is placed in a `_raw` name attribute, for example,  `user_useraname_raw`. The normalized name is placed in the attribute field `user_username`. The rules engine allows the `_raw` username forms to be used in rule creation.

It’s important to note, that if no name normalization configuration exists, the name attribute will consist of the original (non-normalized) form and the system will continue to operate as it does today, with the exception that that `_raw` attribute will also be populated. 

If a name normalization configuration exists, the name attribute will be populated with the form `<username>:<friendly_domain>` where the `<friendly domain name>` portion is not populated for the normalized default domain.  When name normalization is enabled all name fields (not-raw) will be lowercase. For more information, see [Example - single Domain](#example---single-domain) and [Example - multiple domains](#example---multiple-domains), below.

## Configuration

The name normalization feature can be enabled in the **Incoming Data** section under the **Entities** tab of the CSE configuration.

You can configure just username normalization, just hostname normalization, or both. We recommend you enable both. 

There are configuration options to normalize names (“Normalization Formats”) from:

* FQDN - Normalize names in the form `user@somedomain.net` or `hostname.somedomain.net`
* Active Directory - Normalize active directory domains username and hostname formats
* AWS - Normalize AWS ARN and Usernames

## Default domains

When normalization is configured, at least one domain must be configured and a “Normalized Default Domain” must be provided. The default name will never show up in normalized names, as it’s assumed, and username forms with no domain portion will be considered part of that domain. In our example above, we’ve assumed the name “sumo”.

Next, the user should enter the domain name forms that will be seen in the customer's environment.  This should include:

* The fully qualified domain name, for example, `sumologic.com`.
* The active directory domain, for example, `SUMO` or `SUMOLOGIC`.
* The active directory domain name with the `.LOCAL` extension, for example, `SUMO.LOCAL`.
* Any other domains or sub-domains.  

These domains should all have the “Normalized Name” that matches the “Normalized Default Domain”, for example, `sumo`.   

## Secondary domains

The normalization configurations also supports secondary domains that may not map users in a different namespace to the same name. For example, if `bob@sumologic.com` is not the same as `bob@jask.com`, then a secondary domain should be configured.  In this case a second set of configurations should be populated to maps to a different “normalized domain” (`jask`). 

For example, in this case a configuration could be:

* The fully qualified secondary domain (`jask.com`)
* Any secondary domains (`JASK`)

In this case, these domains map to a different normalized domain (`jask`).  When one of these domains is normalized, it will show up as `bob:jask` in the normalized name form.

## Warnings and issues

If no name normalization is configured, the system will continue to operate as it does today.  If normalization is then enabled, any signals already created in the system will use the non-normalized form of the name.  Any new signals will use the normalized name.  This means there is potential for insights to be uncorrelated between the two different name forms for one insight window.  This is especially true as all usernames will now be lowercase. 

## Example UI

An example UI is provided for a case where the customer has a domain name `test.com` and an active directory domain named `test`.

### Example - single domain

In this example, it is assumed the user has configured the system for “Primary domain” and has configured the domains `SUMO` and `sumologic.com`. In this case, assume a log line has a username field:

`bob`

When that’s mapped and normalized, the normalized username is set in the username field:

`user_username = bob`

The raw name is populated in the un-normalized name field:

`user_username_raw = bob`

The same would logic would apply to a hostname:

`device_hostname = desktop1 `

would be populated with the normalized name and the raw name would be
populated:

`device_hostname_raw would be = desktop1`

Now if an AD logon event was identified with the username:

`user_username_raw = SUMO\bob`

In this case, the domain portion (SUMO) would be normalized and the name would be:

`user_username = bob `

The hostname example would be the same:

`device_hostname_raw = SUMO\desktop1`

would have a normalized name 

`device_hostname = desktop1`

This would also hold true for the username `bob@sumologic.com` and the hostname `desktop1@sumologic.com`.   In all of these cases, the usernames or hostnames would normalize to the same name respectively.

For any name not matching a configured domain name, the normalized name would just be set to the username, so in this example:

`user_username = jask\fred`

The normalized username would be:

`user_username_raw = JASK\fred`

#### Example - multiple domains

In this example, it is assumed the user has configured the system for “Primary domain” and has also introduced a sub-domain (JASK). In this case, the configuration looks like:

Normalized Default Domain: sumo

| Domain String | Base Domain |
|:---------------|:-------------|
| SUMO          | sumo        |
| sumologic.com | sumo        |
| JASK          | jask        |
| jask.com      | jask        |

Name forms matching the default domain would look like:

| Username String (raw) | Normalized Value      |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| `bob`                   | `bob`                   |
| `SUMO\bob`              | `bob`                   |
| `bob@sumologic.com`     | `bob`                   |
| `fred@jask.com`         | `fred:jask`            |
| `JASK\fred`             | `fred:jask`             |
| `bob@someothername.com` | `bob@someothername.com` |
| `OTHERDOMAIN\suzy`      | `otherdomain\suzy`     |
