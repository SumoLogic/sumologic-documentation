## About First Seen rules
First Seen rules allow you to generate a Signal when behavior by an entity (user) is encountered that hasn't been seen before. For example, a First Seen rule might look for the events like the following:

* First time a user logged in from a new geographic location (geolocation)
* Newly created or added admin accounts
* High severity EDR alert seen for the first time
* MFA acceptance from first seen device

A First Seen rule is different from other CSE rule types in that you don’t define the criteria for firing a Signal. Instead, the rule expression in a First Seen rule is simply a filter condition that defines what incoming Records the rule will apply to. For each First Seen rule, CSE automatically creates a baseline of normal behavior evidenced by Records that match the Rule Expression. After the baseline period is completed, when an incoming Record includes activity not seen during the baseline period, the rule creates a Signal.

For example, for the “First time a user logged in from a new geographic location” use case, CSE will build a baseline of all the geolocations from where a logon event is seen for the entity (user). Once the baselining period is complete, CSE will create a Signal for every new geolocation detected and incrementally add to the baseline.

## Example rule
The screenshot below shows a First Seen rule in the CSE rules editor. For an explanation of the configuration options, see [Configure a First Seen Rule](#configure-a-first-seen-rule), below.

## Configure a First Seen rule
This section has instructions for configuring a First Seen rule.

### If triggered
The settings in the **If triggered** section determine what Records the rule will be applied to and baseline-related options.

1. **Advanced**. Click **Advanced** to display baseline settings.
   1. **Data Retention**. The number of days after which the data points in the baseline will expire (be dropped from the baseline). The default is 90 days. You can decrease this period, but not increase it.
   1. **Baseline Period**. The minimum amount of time for which data points should be collected before firing a Signal. The default is 30 days.
   :::note
   The **Baseline Period** must be shorter than the **Data Retention** period.
   :::
1.  **When a Record matching the expression**. Enter an expression that matches the Records that you want to rule to apply to.
1. **Has a new value for the field(s)**. Select the Record field that will be used to build the baseline.
1. **after building a [global | per entity]** The settings in this section define the scope of the baseline that will be built.
   * **per entity**. Baselines will be created for all entities for the Entity type or types that you'll specify in the following step. Note that a **per entity** baseline creates a baseline for a particular Entity type. This baseline scope is typically used to track events that an entity has never done before.
   * **global**. Baselining will be performed for all entities and not for specific Entity types. Note that **global** baselines are organizational baselines and are used to track first seen activity across all Entity types.
1. **for the following entity(ies)**. If you selected **per entity** above, you’ll be prompted to select one or Record fields for which you want baselines built.

### Then create a Signal

For instructions, see [Configure “Then Create a Signal” settings](docs/cse/rules/write-match-rule.md#configure-then-create-a-signal-settings) section of the Match Rule topic.
