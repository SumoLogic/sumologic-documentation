## .NET Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability


 Observes for possible exploitation of CVE-2017-8759

## ADPassHunt Tool


 From FireEye Red Team Tool Countermeasures:
This IOC detects indicators associated with the ADPassHunt Tool. This tool is used to hunt for AD credentials and used via execute-assembly that looks for passwords in GPP, Autoruns and AD objects


## AWS - Excessive OAuth Application Permissions Scope


 Alert when an OAuth application has requested a high number of permissions to aspects of AWS.

## AWS - New UserPoolClient Created


 A UserPoolClient is an entity that has permission to call unauthenticated API operations (operations that do not have an authenticated user).

## AWS Cloud Storage Deletion


 Detects the removal of cloud storage infrastructure in AWS.

## AWS CloudTrail - Customer Master Key Disabled or Scheduled for Deletion


 The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) can be used to generate key pairs for encrypting and decrypting your data. Disabling or deleting keys can come with heavy destructive consequences as data encrypted with those keys cannot be decrypted. AWS forces users to either disable keys allowing them to be re-enabled at a later time or users must schedule a key deletion at a later time if the keys absolutely must be removed. The default time for scheduling a key deletion is 30 days.

## AWS CloudTrail - Database Snapshot Created


 Creating DB snapshots is an efficient way for an attacker to begin downloading a targets database.  These signals should be considered around the context of other signals that may indicate data theft is in progress.

## AWS CloudTrail - EC2 Access Key Action Detected


 Actions observed that create, import and delete access keys to EC2 could indicate an advisary is taking action on their objective to extend or otherwise manipulate access to EC2 instance(s).

## AWS CloudTrail - GetSecretValue from non Amazon IP


 The secrets manager service is commonly used by cloud components to retrieve secrets (connection strings etc) while performing routine functions.  This signal identifies when secret values are retrieved via the GetSecretValue API call and the source host does not belong in an Amazon instance IP space.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM CreateUser Action Observed


 This signal fires for all observances of the CreateUser action in the IAM event source.  Creating AWS users is likely a benign, infrequent activity.  Hostile actors will create users to persist access.  Use this signal in context of other activity to determine intent.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM Policy Applied


 A policy was attached to a user, group, or role. By default, IAM denies all access to all services for users, and policies must be applied to grant access to AWS services and resources. This signal could indicate a policy is granting additional access within your cloud environment.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM Privileged Policy Applied to Group


 This rule identifies both 'attach' and 'put' actions with this privileged policy. The difference between 'attach' and 'put' is that 'attach' actions apply a managed policy to an item, where a 'put' action indicates the policy is defined in-line and is part of the items definition. Applying privileged policies to items could indicate hostile action that attempts to increase the privilege level of a user or set of users. Because there are legitimate times when this will occur, consider this signal in context of other activities that may indicate suspicious behavior.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM Privileged Policy Applied to Group (Username)


 This rule identifies both 'attach' and 'put' actions with this privileged policy.  The difference between 'attach' and 'put' is that 'attach' actions apply a managed policy to an item, where a 'put' action indicates the policy is defined in-line and is part of the items definition. Applying privileged policies to items could indicate hostile action that attempts to increase the privilege level of a user or set of users.  There are legitimate times when this will occur, consider this signal in context of other activities that may indicate suspicious behavior.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM Privileged Policy Applied to Role


 This rule identifies both 'attach' and 'put' actions with this privileged policy.  The difference between 'attach' and 'put' is that 'attach' actions apply a managed policy to an item, where a 'put' action indicates the policy is defined in-line and is part of the items definition. Applying privileged policies to items could indicate hostile action that attempts to increase the privilege level of a user or set of users.  There are legitimate times when this will occur, consider this signal in context of other activities that may indicate suspicious behavior.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM Privileged Policy Applied to User


 This rule identifies both 'attach' and 'put' actions with this privileged policy.  The difference between 'attach' and 'put' is that 'attach' actions apply a managed policy to an item, where a 'put' action indicates the policy is defined in-line and is part of the items definition. Applying privileged policies to items could indicate hostile action that attempts to increase the privilege level of a user or set of users.  There are legitimate times when this will occur, consider this signal in context of other activities that may indicate suspicious behavior.

## AWS CloudTrail - IAM User Generating AccessDenied Errors Across Multiple Actions


 An IAM account sent multiple requests to perform a wide distinct number of AWS actions in a short time frame while receiving the error code AccessDenied. This could indicate an account attempting to enumerate their access across the AWS account.

## AWS CloudTrail - Logging Configuration Change Observed


 Changing the configuration of logging to any mission-critical service or platform should be closely monitored.  This signal identifies when AWS logging configurations have been changed.  The severity of signals increases depending on the type of action observed.  For instance disabling/deleting logs is a higher severity than enabling logs.

## AWS CloudTrail - OpsWorks Describe Permissions Event


 This event sourced from AWS OpsWorks occurs rarely.  It could indicate that an adversary is attempting to collect information for later attack.  When successful, the Describe Permissions event returns information regarding a specified stack's permissions for access.

## AWS CloudTrail - Permissions Boundary Lifted


 A Permissions Boundary was lifted against an IAM User or Role. This unusual action may increase the effect permissions to the asset by allowing all the actions granted in its permissions policies.

## AWS CloudTrail - Public S3 Bucket Exposed


 An AWS request occurred to either create a new public bucket or to add a bucket access control list (ACL) to an existing bucket to make it public. While there are some use cases for AWS S3 public buckets, most are generally private. The security operations center should have a strong understanding of which buckets are allowed to be public.

## AWS CloudTrail - Reconnaissance related event


 This signal identifies a small number of CloudTrail API actions that when observed could indicate an actor's intent to enumerate the environment.  These events are generally benign, and occur during normal operations.  Use this signal as context around an unfolding security story.

## AWS CloudTrail - Root Console Successful Login Observed


 This signal detects when a successful root account login occurred within an AWS account. This privileged account should be used within an AWS cloud environment only on a seldom basis. Amazon's best practices state you should only use the root account to create the initial local IAM users and assigned one of the accounts administrative privileges or to perform rare tasks only available to the root user. The security operations center should be aware when the AWS root account is accessed.

## AWS CloudTrail - S3 Bucket Public Access Block Disabled


 Detects when GetPublicAccessBlock returns NoSuchPublicAccessBlockConfiguration, indicating the public access block has all values set to false or the feature is disabled.

## AWS CloudTrail - SQS List Queues Event


 This event sourced from AWS SQS occurs rarely.  It could indicate that an adversary is attempting to collect information for later attack.  When successful, the List Queues event returns all SQS queues that may be valid targets for further probing/attack.

## AWS CloudTrail - ScheduleKeyDeletion in KMS


 Deleting cryptographic key material managed by KMS can be risky. The risk is that after key material is deleted, cypher text may remain that is now indecipherable. Because of this risk, AWS enforces a minimum 7 day waiting period. A key cannot be deleted, it must first be scheduled for deletion by the system. This signal indicates that a key has been scheduled or canceled for deletion. This signal in context of other signals around this entity may describe a hostile pattern of attack.

## AWS CloudTrail - Secrets Manager sensitive admin action observed


 Administrative changes to the AWS Secrets Manager aren't overtly hostile, but are generally low volume and can be considered sensitive.  These signals highlight when these actions occur and can be used in context of other suspicious activity to raise the risk of a hostile entity.  Several Secrets Manager API actions are included and assessed as sensitive.

## AWS CloudTrail - sensitive activity in KMS


 AWS KMS is an encryption and key management web service.  Besides encrypting and decrypting data, users and administrators can use this service to create keys, manage keys etc.  This signal indicates activity that enables and disables keys explicitly.  This activity has been surveyed to be a low volume event and could be considered suspicious given other activity involving the entity.  Additionally, monitoring for these events is required to achieve certain industry audit compliance.

## AWS CloudTrail Network Access Control List Deleted


 Enforcing network-access controls is one of the defensive mechanisms used by cloud administrators to restrict access to a cloud instance. After the attacker has gained control of the console by compromising an admin account, they can delete a network ACL and gain access to the instance from anywhere.

## AWS CloudWatch Alarm Actions Disabled


 Detects the AWS CloudWatch DisableAlarmActions API action. DisableAlarmActions disables the actions for the specified alarms. When an alarm's actions are disabled, the alarm actions do not execute when the alarm state changes.

## AWS CloudWatch Alarm Deletion


 Detects the AWS CloudWatch DeleteAlarms API action. DeleteAlarms deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarm with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation.

## AWS CloudWatch Anomaly Detector Deletion


 Detects the AWS CloudWatch DeleteAnomalyDetector API action. DeleteAnomalyDetector deletes the specified anomaly detection model from your account.

You can optionally specify the IP address of a DNS resolver, an EDNS0 client subnet IP address, and a subnet mask. An adversary could use this API action for testing if various DNS types and domains are allowed.

## AWS Route 53 Traffic Policy Creation


 Detects the AWS Route 53 CreateTrafficPolicy and CreateTrafficPolicyInstance API actions. These actions are used to create DNS resource record sets for domain or subdomain names.

## AWS Secrets Manager Enumeration


 A ListSecrets API call has been made to the AWS Secrets Manager service. Ensure that this activity is expected and authorized.

## AWS WAF Access Control List Updated


 Detects the AWS WAF UpdateWebACL API action. UpdateWebACL updates the specified WebACL. A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests that match the statement of the rule. In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types Rule, RuleGroup, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more AWS resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

## Administrator Login via RDP


 This rule looks for successful logins over RDP for administrator accounts.

## Alibaba ActionTrail Access Key Action Detected


 Actions observed that create, import and delete access keys to EC2 could indicate an adversary is taking action on their objective to extend or otherwise manipulate access to EC2 instance(s).

## Alibaba ActionTrail IAM CreateUser Observed


 This signal fires for all observances of the CreateUser action in the IAM event source.  Creating Alibaba Cloud users is likely a benign, infrequent activity.  Hostile actors will create users to persist access.  Use this signal in context of other activity to determine intent.

## Alibaba ActionTrail KMS Activity


 Alibaba KMS is an encryption and key management web service.  Besides encrypting and decrypting data, users and administrators can use this service to create keys, manage keys etc.  This signal indicates activity that enables and disables keys explicitly.  This activity has been surveyed to be a low volume event and could be considered suspicious given other activity involving the entity.  Additionally, monitoring for these events is required to achieve certain industry audit compliance.

## Alibaba ActionTrail Key Deleted or Disabled


 Deleting cryptographic key material managed by KMS can be risky. The risk is that after key material is deleted, cypher text may remain that is now indecipherable. This signal indicates that a key has been scheduled or canceled for deletion. This signal in context of other signals around this entity may describe a hostile pattern of attack.

## Alibaba ActionTrail ListQueues


 This could indicate that an adversary is attempting to collect information for later attack.  When successful, the List Queues event returns all queues that may be valid targets for further probing/attack.

## Alibaba ActionTrail Logging Configuration Change Observed

## Azure - SQL Database Export


 A database export, especially to a public blob container, may indicate data exfiltration in progress.

## Azure - Secret Backup


 Detects Secret backups within the Azure Key Vault. This may be an indication of data exfiltration and credential compromise.

## Azure - Secret Deleted


 Detects deletions of Azure Key Vault Secrets. If a secret is not backed up or otherwise recoverable (see soft delete) it may render content indecipherable, leading to data loss.

## Azure - Secret Purged


 Detects purges of Azure Key Vault Secrets. If a Secret is not backed up it may render content indecipherable, leading to data loss. Secret purges are performed on already deleted secrets and must be explicitly allowed by the access policy as it renders them unrecoverable unless a backup was made.

## Azure - Storage Deletion


 Detects deletions within an Azure Storage Account.  Deletions of shares and public storage blobs may indicate data destruction.

## Azure - Storage Modification


 Detects modifications within an Azure Storage Account. Write events encapsulate both creations and changes to existing objects. Creation or modifications of shares and public storage blobs may indicate exfiltration attempts.

## Azure - Suspicious User Risk State Associated with Login


 Detects if a sign in has been flagged as "at risk" by Azure Active Directory.

## Azure - Unauthorized OAuth Application


 Alert when a non-approved OAuth Application has been identified on Azure. This rule is disabled by default as a list of approved OAuth applications is required to be enabled. The approved applications should be added to the rule logic under the 'application not in' condition.

## Azure - User Information Downloaded


 Detects a user list download. This may be routine activity, or indiciative of an adversary gathering information about the environment

## Azure - Virtual Machine Creation/Modification


 Detects Azure virtual machine creations or modifications (Azure records a write operation for either). A new virtual machine may be used by an adversary to perform malicious activity.

## Azure - Virtual Machine Deleted


 Detects deletions of Azure virtual machines. Virtual machines may be deleted by an adversary to cover their tracks. Additionally, virtual machines might be deleted purely to cause damage.

## Azure - Virtual Machine Started


 Detects a virtual machine starting in Azure. This is most likely routine activity, however virtual machines may also be used for malicious activity.

## Azure - Virtual Machine Stopped


 Detects a virtual machine starting in Azure. This is most likely routine activity, however virtual machines may also be used for malicious activity.

## Azure PRT Token Issued via Non Interactive Login


 Azure Primary Refresh Tokens (PRT) can be used to authenticate  to Azure Active Directory and Azure compute resources. This rule looks for a PRT token successfully issued via a non-interactive login and when a suspicious User Agent is in use.

## Base32 in DNS Query


 By using base32, binary and text data can be encoded in a way that is fully compliant with DNS protocol specifications.  Since common standard base32 uses 2-7 and the letters a-z, entropy must be measured to distinguish from normal text.  The presence of long base32 encoding in a DNS query may indicate tunneling of information out of a network.  Some security vendors and internet providers also use this technique to operate cloud infrastructure or transport information through firewalled environments.

## Base64 Decode in Command Line


 Malicious files are often encoded in an attempt to bypass security controls that would otherwise inspect the contents of said file.

It is designed for developers to perform (RPC) remote procedure calls for interacting the account database for both local and remote Activity Directory domains. It contains a method called SamrEnumerateUsersInDomain which return a list of users in a domain. Attackers who have network access to the domain can use this method to enumerate a list of user accounts in Active Directory. This signal looks for an RPC connection using the SAMR protocol with the method SamrEnumerateUsersInDomain signifying a request to enumerate user accounts over the network.

## DNS DGA Lookup Behavior - NXDOMAIN Responses


 Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there could potentially be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions. This technique is described in https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1483/.

Threat actors leverage this extensively for executing code on compromised systems. If an attacker is running PsExec for the first time, they will be prompted to accept the end-user license agreement (EULA), which can be passed as the argument accepteula within the command line.

## Direct Outbound DNS Traffic


 This rule detects DNS traffic sent directly to an external server from an internal host, bypassing the existing DNS structure. This could indicate an attacker attempting to conduct command and control without being subjected to DNS monitoring.

## Directory Traversal - Successful


 Directory traversal is an attempt by an attacker to access files located on the host which are not intended to be returned by the web server. For example, attackers seeking usernames/passwords for the host will focus on paths like ../../etc/passwd, ../../../etc/shadow, etc. When successful, a directory traversal attack results in the attacker gaining access to sensitive information and identifying a mechanism of future attack. When unsuccessful, directory traversal is an indication of ongoing external reconnaissance.

## Directory Traversal - Unsuccessful


 Directory traversal is an attempt by an attacker to access files located on the host which are not intended to be returned by the web server. For example, attackers seeking usernames/passwords for the host will focus on paths like ../../etc/passwd, ../../../etc/shadow, etc. When successful, a directory traversal attack results in the attacker gaining access to sensitive information and identifying a mechanism of future attack.

Secrets can be consumed by reference in the pod configuration. Attackers who have permissions to retrieve the secrets from the API server (by using the pod service account, for example) can access sensitive information that might include credentials to various services.

## Kubernetes Pod Created in Kube Namespace


 Detect when a user is creating a pod in one of the Kubernetes default namespaces. The only users creating pods in the kube-system namespace should be cluster administrators. Furthermore, it is best practice to not run any cluster critical infrastructure in the kube-system namespace. The kube-public namespace is intended for Kubernetes objects which should be readable by unauthenticated users. Thus, a pod should likely not be created in the kube-public namespace.

## Kubernetes Pod Created with hostNetwork

## Kubernetes Service Account Created in Kube Namespace


 Detect when a user is creating a service account in one of the Kubernetes default namespaces. The only users creating service accounts in the kube-system namespace should be cluster administrators. Furthermore, it is best practice to not run any cluster critical infrastructure in the kube-system namespace. The kube-public namespace is intended for kubernetes objects which should be readable by unauthenticated users. Thus, a service account should likely not be created in the kube-public namespace.

## Kubernetes Service Account Token File Accessed


 Detects access to the Kubernetes service account access token that is stored within a container in a cluster.

## Kubernetes Service Created with NodePort


 Detect when a service’s port is attached to the node’s IP. Exposing the service’s port to the the node’s IP allows other hosts on the network namespace to access this service.

## Kubernetes User Attached to a Pod
