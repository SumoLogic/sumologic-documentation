description: Learn what CSE schema attributes you can map to Records.
---


This topic lists the schema attributes that you can map to Records. Note that you can map any of the attributes defined below to any [record type](cse-record-types.md). For information about all schema attributes, including those that cannot be mapped to Records, for example enrichment fields, see [Schema Attributes](schema-attributes.md).  

| Field | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| accountId | string   | Account identifiers used in logs from environments where multiple accounts can be used. This is common for cloud providers like AWS.                                                                                                                                                    |
