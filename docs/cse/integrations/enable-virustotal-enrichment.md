The VirusTotal Enrichment enriches signals based on queries it runs against VirusTotal.

:::note
This feature requires the VirusTotal Premium API.
:::

For each insight created, the enrichment checks the records in the signals that contribute to that insight, looking for the values found in certain record attributes that contain IP addresses, URLs, hostnames, or hashes. These are the fields the enrichment examines:

* `srcDevice_ip`
* `dstDevice_ip`
* `http_url`
* `http_hostname`
* `http_url_rootDomain`
* `dns_query`
* `file_hash_imphash`
* `file_hash_md5`
* `file_hash_prehash`
* `file_hash_sha1`
* `file_hash_sha256`
* `file_hash_ssdeep`

The enrichment looks up each value it finds in VirusTotal, calling the VirusTotal API to do so. When a record value has a match in VirusTotal, the enrichment writes the response to Cloud SIEM, where you can view it the signalâ€™s **Enrichment** tab. For an example, see [Example VirusTotal Enrichment](#example-virustotal-enrichment).

:::note
VirusTotal enrichments are only added to signals that are part of an insight.
