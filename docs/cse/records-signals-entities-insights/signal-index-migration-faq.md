## Summary

Starting last year, Signals generated by Cloud SIEM Enterprise (CSE) are automatically saved in a standardized `sec_signal` index. This special partition is similar to the existing `sec_record` indices in that, unlike data retained using the older Signal Forwarding feature, it is stored in a format that supports keyword search, nested attributes, and other standard log search features.

The new index is automatically generated and retained for a period of 2 years at no additional cost for all CSE customers.

As a result, the optional Signal Forwarding feature in CSE will be deprecated on **November 30, 2023**. Existing data will not be deleted, but new Signals generated after that date will no longer be forwarded and the option will no longer be available in CSE. **Customers leveraging Signal Forwarding data to generate dashboards (or for other use cases) will need to modify those applications to use the new `sec_signal` index before then.**

## Differences compared to Signal Forwarding

The new `sec_signal` index has some differences compared to the older Signal Forwarding feature. The new index:
* Fully supports log search features such as keyword search, nested attributes, filtering by selected values, and so on.
* Does not include the `fields` section inside the `fullRecords` object (this is because the fields are variable in length, and for some Signals will cause the log message to exceed the maximum size supported by Sumo Logic); the old Signal Forwarding included as many records that would fit (which was inconsistent).
* Has standardized attribute names/formats (in alignment with standard Sumo Logic naming conventions as used in the `sec_record` indices). This goes beyond just the switch from “snake_case” to “camelCase”; specifically:
     * The `asset` object has been replaced with the more accurate `entities` object. The new object is (potentially) multi-valued, and the attribute names have changed from `name` to `value`, from `asset_type` to `type`. Also, `entity_criticality` (now `criticality`) and `entity_suppressed` (now `suppressed`) have moved from the top level of the log message to the `entities` object. These values can be accessed in an expression with syntax like `| count by %entities[0].type`.
     :::note
     As a reminder (this is not new with the new index), `criticality` and `suppression` are representative of those values at the point in time that the Signal was created. Those values could have changed later.
     :::
     * Timestamps are now strings instead of integers.
     * The `prototype` attribute is now a string instead of a boolean.
     * The `extra` object has been deprecated. The `matchExpression` attribute contained in this object has been promoted to the top level of the log message.
* The following attributes/objects are no longer included in the new index:
     * `is_whitelisted` (which was deprecated in April 2022)
     * `multiEntitySharedId` (this was an internal attribute that was not meant to be exposed to users)
     * `new_rule_id` (duplicate of `rule_id`)
     * The `threat_indicators` object is no longer included (this has been deprecated for some time)
* Users may see a different number of signals for the same time period when comparing the `sec_signal` index with the old Signal Forwarding data. This is due to a number of factors related to how the Sumo platform and Cloud SIEM calculate start and end times and which timestamps are used in the different indices. But over the long term, both methods include the same signals.  

The following table lists an example of the same Signal in the old format from Signal Forwarding and the new format in the `sec_signal` index:

## Migrating from Signal Forwarding to the new index

Because the signal data is used differently in different applications, it’s not possible to outline an exact set of steps to take to migrate to the new index. However, in general, the primary step is to adapt to the new attribute names and related changes listed above. For example, if retrieving the entity criticality, one must switch from the `entity_criticality` attribute to the `%entities[0].criticality` attribute. 

If your application depended on the `fields` object of the `full_records` object, then you will need to utilize the `objectType` to find the correct `sec_record` index (`sec_record_authentication` in the example above) and then find the record using the `uid` value (in this example, `044922c0-6044-5fa8-b66c-914a04140572`). You can also use the timestamp of the record to speed up the search.

Here’s an example of how to use one of the `fields` objects in a dashboard:

```
_index=sec_record_authentication AND uid=044922c0-6044-5fa8-b66c-914a04140572
| count %"fields.<fieldname1>", %"fields.<fieldname2>"
```
