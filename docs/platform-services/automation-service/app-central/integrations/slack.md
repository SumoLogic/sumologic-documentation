## Slack configuration

1. [Create](https://api.slack.com/apps) a Slack App on your workspace.
1. Click on **Create an App** button.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-1.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
1. Choose **From scratch**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-2.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="400"/>
1. Insert a name for the app and select the workspace.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-3.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="400"/>
1. Once you create your App, you have to add **Permissions**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-4.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
1. Alternatively, you can see **OAuth & Permissions** from this page.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-5.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
1. Now you have to add the Scopes for User Token and Bot Token. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-6.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
    * Tokens
        * Bot tokens let your app act independently.
        * User tokens allow you to work directly on behalf of users, based on the OAuth scopes that installing users awards to your app.
    * Actions <br/>All the Actions required scopes depend on the type of channel-like object you're working with. To use the Actions, you'll need at least one of the `channels:`, `groups:`, `im:` or `mpim:` scopes corresponding to the conversation type you're working with.
        * Send Message Action <br/>BOT users cannot post to a direct message conversation between two users using Send Message Action. If your app was involved in the conversation, then it would be a multi-person direct message instead. Apps can post to direct message conversations between users when a shortcut or slash command belonging to that app is used in the conversation.
        * Get User Action <br/>This Action returns information about a member of a workspace. If you want to search for users, it's possible to manage it with an Exact match or without an Exact match. Also, this action will return on the field name users\_ids in JSON, which you can use in Playbook, if you want to invite many users to the channel.
        * Delete Action <br/>When used with a typical user token, may only delete messages posted by that user. When used with a bot user's token, may delete only messages posted by that bot user.
        * Invite To Channel Action <br/>This action invites 1–1000 users to a public or private channel. The calling user must be a member of the channel. And also the invites must not be the owner of the channel.
        * Create Channel Action <br/>At least one user needs to be invited when creating a public or private conversation. Otherwise, workspace apps could create invisible channels, which might cause a few problems.
        * Deactivate Account Action <br/>This Admin API removes a user from a workspace. This app cannot be installed on a workspace. Apps with this feature are only available to Enterprise customers.
        * Archive Channel Action <br/>This Action archives a conversation. Not all types of conversations can be archived.   
          :::note
          Limits for workspace apps <br/>Because workspace apps cannot act on behalf of users, they do not have the power to archive conversations, except when they're the owner/creator of the conversation.
          :::
1. Now for each action of Slack Integration, you need different scopes to be added to the BOT or User.
    * **Actions: List Channels / Get Channel / Get Members**<br/>Bot Token and User Token need the same scopes:
        * `channels:read`. View basic information about public channels in a workspace.
        * `groups:read`. View basic information about private channels that your Slack app has been added to.
        * `im:read`. View basic information about direct messages that your Slack app has been added to.
        * `mpim:read`. View basic information about group direct messages that your Slack app has been added to.
    * **Actions: Create channel / Invite To Channel / Remove User From Channel / Archive Channel / Rename Channel**
        * Bot Token:
            * `channels:manage`. Manage public channels that your Slack app has been added to and create new ones.
        * User Token:
            * `channels:write`. Manage a user’s public channels and create new ones on a user’s behalf.
        * These scopes are the same for Bot and User tokens:
            * `groups:write`. Manage private channels that your Slack app has been added to and create new ones.
            * `im:write`. Start direct messages with people.
            * `mpim:write`. Start group direct messages with people.
    * **Actions: List Users / Get User**<br/>Bot Token and User Token need the same scopes:
        * `users:read`. View people in a workspace.
        * `users:read.email`. View email addresses of people in a workspace.
    * **Actions: List Conversations History**<br/>Bot Token and User Token need the same scopes:
        * `channels:history`. View messages and other content in public channels that your Slack app has been added to.
        * `groups:history`. View messages and other content in private channels that your Slack app has been added to.
        * `im:history`. View messages and other content in direct messages that your Slack app has been added to.
        * `mpim:history`. View messages and other content in group direct messages that your Slack app has been added to.
    * **Actions: Send Message / Delete Message**<br/>Bot Token and User Token need the same scopes:
        * `chat:write`. Post messages in approved channels and conversations.
    * **Actions: Deactivate Account**
        * User Token:
            * `admin.users:write`. Modify account information.
    * **Actions: Search into Conversations**
        * User Token:
            * `search:read`. Search a workspace’s content.
    * **Actions: Send File**<br/>Bot Token and User Token need the same scopes:
        * `files:write`. Upload, edit, and delete files as your Slack app.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-7.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="400"/><br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-8.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="400"/>
1. Now you need to Install the APP in the workspace. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-9.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
1. After installing the App now, you have two Tokens; these tokens are automatically generated when you installed the app. You will need these two tokens later. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/slack/slack-10.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="slack" width="800"/>
