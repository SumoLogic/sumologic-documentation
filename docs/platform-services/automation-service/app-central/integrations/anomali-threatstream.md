***Version: 1.2  
Updated: Jun 27, 2023***

Anomali ThreatStream (previously known as ThreatStream Optic) is Threat Intelligence Management that automates the collection and processing of raw data, filters out the noise, and transforms it into relevant, actionable threat intelligence for security teams. This integration allows you to pull threat intelligence from the ThreatStream platform, import observables into ThreatStream, manage threat model entities and investigations, and so on.

* **Search Into Observables** (*Enrichment*) - To retrieve threat intelligence from ThreatStream.
* **Add Observable** (*Containment*) - To import structured threat data (observables) into ThreatStream, without requiring approval of the imported data through the ThreatStream UI.
* **Update Observable Tags** (*Containment*) - Enables you to add observable tags in bulk.
