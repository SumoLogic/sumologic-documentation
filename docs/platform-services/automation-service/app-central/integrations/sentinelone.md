SentinelOne Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP) unifies prevention, detection, and response in a single, purpose-built agent powered by machine learning and automation. It provides prevention and detection of attacks across all major vectors, rapid elimination of threats with fully automated, policy-driven response capabilities, and complete visibility into the endpoint environment with full-context, real-time forensics.
