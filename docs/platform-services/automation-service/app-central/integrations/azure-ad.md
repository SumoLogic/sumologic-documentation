## Azure Active Directory Configuration

The following steps show how to create an Azure AD Application in order to work with Cloud SOAR.

1. Log into Azure portal with the user that has administrator privileges.

1. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-1.png)

1. In the registration form, choose a name for your application and then click Register. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-2.png)

1. Write down the Application ID and Directory ID, you will need them later for the integration configuration. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-3.png)

1. Configure Azure AD Application permissions: on the left choose API permissions.

1. Then click the Add a permission button. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-4.png)

1. Select your application in App registrations in the Azure portal. 
   * Delegated permissions are selected by default. 
   * Delegated permissions are appropriate for client apps that access an API as the signed-in user, and whose access should be restricted to the permissions you select in the next step. 
   * Application permissions are for service or daemon-type applications that need to access API as themselves, without user interaction for sign-in or consent. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-5.png)

1. Select the following permissions to add:
   * Delegated (work or school account): User.Read, User.ReadWrite, User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All
   * Delegated (personal Microsoft account): User.Read, User.ReadWrite
   * Application: User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All

   You should have the permissions as in the screenshot below: <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-6.png)

1. Once API permission are added then Admin must consent to a grant these permissions ([Learn more about permissions and consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps)). <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-7.png)

1. Once Admin Consent is granted, API permissions configuration have been completed. Then we have to add a Client secret that will be used for the authentication, along with Client ID and Directory ID. 

   To add Client secret, go to Certificates and secrets, and click New client secret. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-8.png)

1. Select description and expiry period for the created secret and create it.

1. Once it's created, make sure you save its value, since its only displayed once. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-9.png)

1. Once you do these steps you will need to find the Tenant ID in order to use it on your resources file. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/azure-ad/azure-ad-10.png)

1. Configuration of Azure AD application is completed, you will need applicationâ€™s Client ID, secret, Tenant ID.
