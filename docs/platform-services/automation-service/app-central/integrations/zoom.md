## Zoom configuration

The Zoom API uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate and authorize users to make requests. To set up access credentials and request scopes for your app, create a Server-to-Server OAuth app. This will enable you to securely integrate with Zoom APIs and get your account owner access token without user interaction.

**Create a Server-to-Server OAuth app**

Please follow these steps to create a Server-to-Server OAuth app:

1. Sign in to Zoom Marketplace : [https://marketplace.zoom.us/](https://marketplace.zoom.us/). From the Develop menu, choose Build App.

1. Choose the Server-to-Server OAuth app type.   <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/zoom/zoom-2.png)

1. Add a name for your app.   <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/zoom/zoom-3.png)

1. App credentials - View your Account ID, Client ID and Client Secret.   <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/zoom/zoom-4.png)

1. Information - Add information about your app, such as a short description and developer contact information (name and email address is required for activation).

1. Define the API methods this app is allowed to call - Add Scopes.  <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/zoom/zoom-5.png)   

1. Choose the appropriate scopes according to the scope required by each Zoom action:   
	* Delete Meeting - meeting:write:admin, meeting:write
	* Get Meeting Invitation - meeting:read:admin, meeting:read
	* Get User - user:read:admin, user:read, user\_info:read
	* Get User Settings - user:read:admin, user:read
	* List Meetings - meeting:read:admin, meeting:read
	* List Users - user:read:admin
	* Update Meeting - meeting:write:admin, meeting:write
	* Update User - user:write:admin, user:write
	* Update User Settings - user:write:admin, user:write

1. Activate your app. If you see errors that prevent activation, please address them. You will not be able to generate an access token to make API calls unless your app is activated. If your app is deactivated, existing tokens will no longer work. You can also choose to Deactivate your app in this section.   <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/zoom/zoom-6.png)

1. The optional parameter timezone in the actions Update Meeting and Update User can be chosen form the table Timezones in the following [Abbreviation Lists](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/other-references/abbreviation-lists/#timezones).
