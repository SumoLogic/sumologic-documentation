## Microsoft Teams Configuration

Each application you want the Microsoft identity platform to perform identity and access management (IAM) needs to be registered. Registering it establishes a trust relationship between your application and the identity provider, the Microsoft identity platform.

**Register an Application**

Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around.

Follow these steps to create the app registration:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1.  If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directory + subscription** filter ![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-1.png) in the top menu to select the tenant in which you want to register an application.
1. Search for and select the **Azure Active Directory.**
1. Under Manage, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.
1. Select **Register** to complete the initial app registration. <br/>![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-2.png)

1. Don't enter anything for Redirect URI (optional)

1. When registration completes, the Azure portal displays the app registration's Overview pane, which includes its **Application (client) ID**. Also referred to as just *client ID*, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.

The client ID as one aspect in validating the security tokens it receives from the identity platform.

![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-3.png)

**Add Credentials**

Credentials are used by confidential client applications that access an API. Examples of confidential clients are web apps, or service- and daemon-type applications. Credentials allow your application to authenticate as itself, requiring no interaction from a user at runtime.

You can add client secrets (a string) as credentials to your confidential client app registration.

![](/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/microsoft-teams/microsoft-teams-4.png)

**Add a Client Secret**

The client secret, known also as an *application password*, is a string value of your app.

1. Select your application in **App registrations** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Certificates & secrets** > **New client secret.**
1. Add a description for your client secret.
1. Select a duration.
1. Select **Add**.
1. **Record the secret's** value for use in your client application resource - it's *never displayed again* after you leave this page.

 **Add Permissions to API**

1. Select your application in **App registrations** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **API permissions** > **Add a permission**
1. **Delegated permissions** are selected by default. Delegated permissions are appropriate for client apps that access an API as the signed-in user, and whose access should be restricted to the permissions you select in the next step.
1. **Application permissions** are for service- or daemon-type applications that need to access API as themselves, without user interaction for sign-in or consent. Unless you've defined application roles for your API.
1. Select **Add a permission,** and ***below are the permissions to be added to the application you just created.***
