## Gmail Configuration

1) Create a new Project in the Developer Console [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/)

2) In the APIs & Services section, navigate to Credentials and select Create Credentials: [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api)

3) Select OAuth Client ID as the credential type and set the following inputs:

* Application Type: Web Application
* Authorized redirect URIs > Add URI: 'http://localhost/'
* Note: Will only be used to generate a refresh token.

4) Copy the resulting Client ID and Client Secret Key values, as these will be used later.

5) Navigate to the OAuth Consent Screen section and set the following inputs:

* App Name
* User Support Email: Set to an email that you have access to.
* Developer Contact Information: Set to an email that you have access to.

6) The following Scopes are needed:

* 'https://mail.google.com'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic'
* 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.sharing'

7) In Cloud SOAR, navigate to Settings > Integrations > Gmail, add a new Resource and provide the following inputs:

* Client ID (generated in step 4)
* Client Secret Key (generated in step 4)

8) Save and close the Resource

9) Click and execute the **Authorize DO NOT USE IN PLAYBOOK** action. If successful, a URL will be returned.

10) Open a new browser tab, and navigate to the URL generated in the previous step.

11) Provide consent for this developer project to access the Gmail API.   
 

12) The response to this consent flow is the localhost redirect specified earlier. Copy this URL.

13) Within this URL, copy the code nested in this URL: 

'http://localhost/?code=4/0AbUR2VXXXXFe8kuMTUE4Dkxts4J8mo3\_BkZKxXAcdzXXXXtd9lrjai00pEuG0YXWtWjimg&scope=https://mail.google.com/%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.settings.basic'

14) In Cloud SOAR, click and run the **Confirm DO NOT USE IN PLAYBOOK** action, providing the code generated above in the Code input.

15) This will return a JSON result with a "**credentials**" key. Copy the value of this key, which is a base64-encoded string JSON credential we will use in the next and final step.

16) Paste the base64 string in the "**Credentials**" field of the Integration Resource created in step 7. Save and close the resource window.

17) You can test that the integration credentials are working by running the "**Get Labels**" action (no inputs are needed). If successful, it will return a JSON result of mail labels.
