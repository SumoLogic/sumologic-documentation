***Version: 1.1  
Updated: March 26, 2025***

## Overview

### Purpose

AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules that allow, block, or monitor (count) web requests based on conditions that you define.
This integration is designed to manage and retrieve WAF security configurations, including IP sets, regex pattern sets, rule groups, and web access control lists (web ACLs). It enables you to define, update, delete, and retrieve security rule assets that inspect and control web request traffic.

### Use cases

* Creating and managing IP allowlists/denylists
* Defining regex-based pattern rules for request inspection
* Grouping multiple rules in custom rule groups
* Fetching details and summaries of rule components
* Updating existing rules in response to new threats

### Supported versions

This integration supports WAFv2 API actions and works with resources.
It is compatible with all standard environments where WAFv2 actions are supported.

### Prerequisites

* IAM permissions for:
  * `wafv2:CreateIPSet, DeleteIPSet, UpdateIPSet, GetIPSet, ListIPSets`
  * `wafv2:CreateRegexPatternSet, DeleteRegexPatternSet, ListRegexPatternSets`
  * `wafv2:CreateRuleGroup, DeleteRuleGroup, GetRuleGroup, ListRuleGroups`
  * `wafv2:GetWebACL, ListWebACLs, ListResourcesForWebACL`
  * `wafv2:GetManagedRuleSet, ListManagedRuleSets, ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups`
* Proper region selection for WAFv2 API calls (`regional` or `global` scope)
* API credentials with sufficient access

### Limitations

* Regex complexity may be limited by the WAF regex engine's constraints.
* All changes require propagation time before taking effect (~1-2 minutes).

## Configure AWS WAF in Automation Service and Cloud SOAR

import IntegrationsAuth from '../../../../reuse/integrations-authentication.md';

<IntegrationsAuth/>

### Installation

[Install](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-app-central/#install-an-integration-from-app-central) the AWS WAF application from App Central.

### Configuration

After installing the AWS WAF application, create an AWS WAF resource to begin executing actions.

Refer to the image below for guidance on creating an AWS WAF resource.

<img src={useBaseUrl('/img/platform-services/automation-service/app-central/integrations/aws-waf/aws-waf-1.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="Edit Resource for AWS WAF" width="400"/>

Provide the following details:
* Access Key
* Secret Key
* AWS Region
* Scope
* Automation Engine

Once the information is filled in, click on Test to quickly verify that the provided details are correct.

### Verification

To verify the integration is working, execute any Enrichment action, or once the resource is created, test the resource.

## Usage

### Basic usage

* Create an IP Set (allow/block IPs).
* Create a Regex Pattern Set (match request components).
* Group rules using Rule Groups.
* Retrieve or list existing components for monitoring or inspection.

### Advanced usage

Bulk Listing & Auditing: List all rule groups, regex sets, IP sets, and WebACLs and map their usage across resources.

## API reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

| Issue | Description | Solution |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| WAFNonexistentItemException | Occurs when trying to access or delete a non-existent resource. | Double-check the ID, Name, and Scope. Use List APIs to confirm existence. |
| WAFOptimisticLockException | Indicates a stale or missing LockToken when updating or deleting resources.  | Always fetch the latest LockToken using Get API before performing updates/deletes.  |
| WAFInvalidParameterException | One or more parameters are invalid or missing. |                              Verify that all required parameters are included and correctly formatted (for example, CIDR for IP sets). |
| AccessDeniedException  | Occurs when permissions are insufficient.  | Check IAM roles and policies assigned to the user or service making the request. Ensure `wafv2:*` permissions are included. |
| Resource still appears after deletion. | A deleted IPSet, RuleGroup, etc. still seems accessible in the UI or APIs.  | Allow a few seconds for propagation. Use Get `<action-type>` or List `<action-type>` to confirm removal. |
| IP addresses not being blocked.  | Traffic from listed IPs still reaches the application. | Ensure the IPSet is attached to a WebACL and the WebACL is associated with the resource (for example, CloudFront or ALB). |


### FAQs

#### Can I reuse an IPSet in different rule groups?

Yes, an IPSet can be used in several rule groups or WebACLs. You don’t need to create a new one for each use.

#### What’s the difference between REGIONAL and CLOUDFRONT scopes?

REGIONAL is used for AWS services like Application Load Balancers, API Gateway, and App Runner.

CLOUDFRONT is specifically for CloudFront distributions and must be managed in the US East (N. Virginia) region.

#### Why aren’t my changes showing up right away?

Updates can take a few moments to fully apply within AWS. Try retrieving the latest configuration using the appropriate Get API call to confirm.

#### What if the IP address I provide isn’t in CIDR format?

If the IP isn’t formatted correctly (for example, missing the CIDR suffix), AWS WAF will return a WAFInvalidParameterException. Make sure IPs follow the CIDR notation like 192.0.2.0/24.
