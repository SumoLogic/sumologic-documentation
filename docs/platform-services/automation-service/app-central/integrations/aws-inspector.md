## Configure AWS Inspector in Automation Service and Cloud SOAR

import IntegrationsAuth from '../../../../reuse/integrations-authentication.md';

<IntegrationsAuth/>

* **Label**. Enter the name you want to use for the resource.
* **Access Key**. Enter an [access key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) to provide authentication. (Although AWS recommends using IAM roles with temporary security credentials instead of access keys, our AWS integrations currently support only access keys due to the need for dynamically managed credentials.)
* **Secret Key**. Enter the secret access key associated with the access key ID.
* **Region**. Enter your [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/aws-regions.html).
* **Automation engine**. Select whether to use [Cloud or Bridge execution](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-integrations/#cloud-or-bridge-execution).
* **Proxy Options**. Select whether to use an [AWS proxy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-proxy.html).
