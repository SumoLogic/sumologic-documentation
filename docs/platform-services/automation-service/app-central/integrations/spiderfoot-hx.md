Updated: Jul 07, 2023

SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence automation tool. SpiderFoot can be used offensively (e.g. in a red team exercise or penetration test) for reconnaissance of your target or defensively to gather information about what you or your organisation might have exposed over the Internet. You can target the following entities in a SpiderFoot scan: IP address, domain/sub-domain name, hostname, network subnet (CIDR), ASN, e-mail address, phone number, username, person's name, bitcoin address.

SpiderFoot's 200+ modules feed each other in a publisher/subscriber model to ensure maximum data extraction to do things like:

* Host/sub-domain/TLD enumeration/extraction
* Email address, phone number and human name extraction
* Bitcoin and Ethereum address extraction
* Bitcoin and Ethereum address extraction
* Threat intelligence and Blacklist queries
* API integration with SHODAN, HaveIBeenPwned, GreyNoise, AlienVault, SecurityTrails, etc.
* Social media account enumeration
* S3/Azure/Digitalocean bucket enumeration/scraping
* IP geo-location
* Web scraping
* Web content analysis
* Image, document and binary file meta data analysis
* Dark web searches
* Port scanning and banner grabbing
* Data breach searches, etc.
