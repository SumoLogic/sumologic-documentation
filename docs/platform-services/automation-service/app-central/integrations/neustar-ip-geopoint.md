IP GeoPoint to gain independent, real-time insights into each website or network visitor as they connect, based only on the IP address of their device. Designed for use in decisioning workflows, the data includes invaluable information about the location of the user – in many cases down to the postal code – as well as insights into how they are connecting to the Internet and the organization responsible for the IP address.
