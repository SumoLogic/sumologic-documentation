import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The [Audit Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/audit-event-index/) provides event logs in JSON format on your account activity allowing you to monitor and audit changes. By default, the Audit Event Index is enabled for the Automation Service.

:::note
Audit logging for the Automation Service uses the same logging as Cloud SOAR, since the Automation Service is based on core functionality in Cloud SOAR. See [Cloud SOAR Audit Logging](/docs/cloud-soar/audit-event-index/).

## Search the Audit Event Index

Searching the Audit Event Index is the same as running a normal search against your ingested data. You specify the `_index` metadata field with one of these values: 

* `sumologic_audit_events`. This index contains user action events, which are events that were triggered by a user action, either from the UI or an API.
* `sumologic_system_events`. This index contains system action events, which are events that were triggered by Sumo Logic. For example, this index contains Automation Actions start events, rules triggered, and so on.

## Automation Service audited events

To search for audit events for a specific feature, use the metadata field `_sourceCategory` with its corresponding value. 

For Automation Service (and Cloud SOAR) events, every `_sourceCategory` related to a feature has the prefix `oar`. To limit the events returned to the Automation Service and Cloud SOAR, you can use:

```sql
(_index=sumologic_audit_events OR _index=sumologic_system_events) _sourceCategory=oar*
```

To search playbook executions, you would use the query:

```sql
_index=sumologic_audit_events _sourceCategory=oarPlaybookExecutions
```

To search for system action events for Automation Actions, you would use the query:

```sql
_index=sumologic_system_events _sourceCategory=oarAutomationActions
```

The table below shows the `_sourceCategory` that is assigned to event logs by Automation Service feature.

| Product Feature | _sourceCategory Value |
|:--|:--|
| [App Central packages](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-app-central/)  | `oarAppCentralPackages`   |
| [Automation action](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-playbooks/#add-an-action-node-to-a-playbook) | `oarAutomationActions`  |
| [Integration](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-integrations/)   | `oarIntegrations`  |
| [Integration resource](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-integration-framework/)   | `oarIntegrationResources` |
| [Playbook execution](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-playbooks/)  | `oarPlaybookExecutions`   |
| [Playbook revision](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-playbooks/)  | `oarPlaybookRevisions`    |

## _sourceName and _sourceHost assignment

The `_sourceName` and `_sourceHost` fields are assigned to audit event logs as follows.

| Metadata Field | Assignment Description |
|:--|:--|
| `_sourceName` | Value of the common parameter, `eventName`. |
| `_sourceHost` | The remote IP address of the host that made the request. If not available, the value will be `no_sourceHost`. |

## Common parameters

Each audit event log has common keys that categorize it to a product area and provide details of the event.

| Parameter | Description | Data Type |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `accountId` | The unique identifier of the organization. | String |
| `eventId` | The unique identifier of the event. | String |
| `eventName` | The name of the event. | String |
| `eventTime` | The event timestamp in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. | String |
| `eventFormatVersion` | The event log format version. | String |
| `operator` | Information of who did the operation. If it's missing, the Sumo service was the operator. | JSON object of Strings |
| `subsystem` | The product area of the event. | String |

## Search the Audit Event Index for Automation Service events

To search the Audit Event Index for logs that describe Automation Service events:

1. Open a search tab in the Sumo Logic UI by clicking **+ New** and choosing **Log Search**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/search/get-started-search/search-basics/new-log-search-UI-buttons.png')} alt="New log search" width="400"/>
1. In the search tab, enter a search using `_index` to specify the partition you want to search, and other metadata or fields to further scope your search. For example:
    ```sql
    (_index=sumologic_system_events or _index=sumologic_audit_events) _sourceCategory=oar*
    | where subsystem contains "Playbook"
    ```
1. Choose the time range for your search.
1. Click **Start** to run the search.

## Example event log

Here is an example `PlaybookExecutionStarted` event log.

```json

   "eventName": "PlaybookExecutionStarted",
   "eventTime": "2023-10-05T13:22:59.786+00:00Z",
   "eventFormatVersion": "1.0 beta",
   "severityLevel": "Info",
   "PlaybookExecutionIdentity": {

   },
   "from": {
      "status": "Not executed"
   },
   "to": {
      "status": "Running"
   }
}
```

## Index retention period 

By default, the retention period of the Audit Event Index is the same as the retention period of your Default Partition. You can change the retention period by editing the relevant partitions, `sumologic_audit_events` and `sumologic_system_events`. For more information, see [Create and Edit a Partition](/docs/manage/partitions/data-tiers/create-edit-partition).
