import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The [Audit Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/audit-event-index/) and [System Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/system-event-index/) provide event logs in JSON format on your account activity allowing you to monitor and audit changes. By default, the Audit Event Index and System Event Index are enabled for the Automation Service and Cloud SOAR.

:::note
Audit logging for the Automation Service uses the same logging as Cloud SOAR, since the Automation Service is based on core functionality in Cloud SOAR. For more information about the shared functionality, see [Cloud SOAR Compared to the Automation Service](/docs/cloud-soar/compared-to-automation-service/).
:::

## Where to find documentation

For documentation of the audit log definitions, see [Automation Service and Cloud SOAR audit log definitions](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/documentation-audit-log-definitions/#automation-service-and-cloud-soar-audit-log-definitions).

## Search for events

Searching the Audit Event Index and System Event Index is the same as running a normal search against your ingested data. You specify the `_index` metadata field with one of these values: 

* `sumologic_audit_events`. This index contains user action events, which are events that were triggered by a user action, either from the UI or an API.
* `sumologic_system_events`. This index contains system action events, which are events that were triggered by Sumo Logic. For example, this index contains Automation Actions start events, rules triggered, and so on.

To search for events:

1. <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). Kanso--> Click the **+ New** button at the top of the screen and select **Log Search**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new/). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Logs > Log Search**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Log Search**.  Kanso-->
1. In the search tab, enter a search using `_index` to specify the partition you want to search, and other metadata or fields to further scope your search. For example:
    ```sql
    (_index=sumologic_audit_events or _index=sumologic_system_events) _sourceCategory=oar*
    | where subsystem contains "Playbook"
    ```
1. Choose the time range for your search.
1. Click **Start** to run the search.

## Audit Event Index events

The [Audit Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/audit-event-index/) has detailed JSON logs for the following Automation Service and Cloud SIEM features.

## Index retention period 

By default, the retention period of the Audit Event Index and System Event Index is the same as the retention period of your Default Partition. You can change the retention period by editing the relevant partitions, `sumologic_audit_events` and `sumologic_system_events`. For more information, see [Create and Edit a Partition](/docs/manage/partitions/data-tiers/create-edit-partition).
