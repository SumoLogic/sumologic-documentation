- Structured/Vectored Exception Handling anti-debug tricks.
- Threat Control;

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 4 - Anti-Worm

*Worm Infection*

The purpose of this playbook is to recognize worms from several indicators such as very high frequency of local area network communication, automated outgoing emails, etc.

### 5 - AntiVirus Infection

*Infection*

Playbook to be executed when an antivirus repeat infection has been found. 

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 6 - AV Infection Detected

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 9 - Block user - Cookie Based

*Incident Response*

Playbook to block a user that is navigating on a suspicious domain. 

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 10 - Brute Force Attack

*Unauthorized Access*

A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as a user password or personal identification number (PIN) or any other personal data. In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. In general, it is a systematical check of all possible passwords and passphrases combinations until the correct one is found. Scripts are usually used in these attacks to automate the process of arriving at the correct username/password combination.

Brute force attacks are usually mitigated by WAF technologies provided by popular market vendors such as Cloudflare, Akamay, Arbor Networks, Amazon Cloud Front, etc. In this case, the attack is not even perceived but mitigated automatically. With reference to the current tools on the market, among the mostly used brute force tools are THC Hydra and Patator. This playbook implies that these preventive systems are not in place or have been evaded.

:::note
Attackers can derive the pattern to define user accounts or corporate email addresses just analyzing the syntax of a valid target email address and demographic details of employees (for example, gathered on social networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, etc). At that stage, it is easy to derive the list of potential accounts, and the password is the last piece of info that needs to be guessed.
:::

<SamplePlaybooks/>

*Malicious Activity*

Playbook process with an alarm received from McAfee in order to enrich and automate the investigation.

### 16 - Critical Vulnerability

*Vulnerability*

Playbook created to be followed in case a critical vulnerability/flaw is discovered.Upon receiving a new critical vulnerability, the playbook provides a list of all target vulnerabilities through Qualys.

If the vulnerability has already been identified, the playbook involves searching for events in the SIEM related to that vulnerability to check all possible correlations between the vulnerability and possible exploit attempts, creating a risk scoring activity.

If the critical vulnerability identified has not been previously identified, the playbook gives us the opportunity to conduct a VA business through Qualys, authenticated or uncertified, to see if it really exists for our purposes. If the vulnerability is present, the playbook notifies the service engineers by email, otherwise it sends another email informing that the vulnerability has already been patched.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 17 - Data Breach Security Incident

*Data Breach*

Playbook created to be followed in the event of a data breach security incident. If the playbook detects events in the firewall or SIEM related to the data breach, it expects to automatically perform CTI activities to track and identify the source of the violation, giving the user a choice  to block the source IP and restore the user password.

If the playbook does not find correlations regarding the possible data breach and firewall / SIEM events, it will inform the SOC and the original user. If the source user does not recognize the activities, a task will be created automatically to decide how to proceed, otherwise the incident will be closed as a false positive.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 18 - DDoS

*Denial of Service*

DDoS attack playbook which can be executed based on distributed denial of service use case. The playbook performs the first check in order to verify the traffic and the source IPs, if these should exceed a certain threshold the execution continues by carrying out a second search and, via ssh, checking the use of the resources of the server under attack.

If the condition is true, the playbook performs CTI activities to detect if the source IPs are malicious or not, including in the user choice all the data collected and giving the analyst the possibility of being able to block the sources. In the event of a ceased attack and false positive, the SOC will receive an email containing the report relating to the events.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 19 - DDoS Spoof

*DDOS*

Distributed denial of service is a serious type of DDoS attack where attackers try to prevent the legitimate use of a service. These types of attacks come in two forms: the attacks that crash services, and the attacks that flood services to the extreme that they are not available.

Spoofed Address Floods - Some DoS attacks use spoofed or illegal IP addresses, which will never be properly routed back to the source. To mitigate these spoofed attacks, one should implement reverse path validation on ingress routers in combination with dropping non-local subnets at egress routers. This combination of ingress and egress filtering will drop these illegal packets before they reach the firewall.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 20 - Decision tree for DOS

*Denial of Service*

Verify threshold, impact, and node type for ticket creation or not by using the decision tree based on previous alerts. By parsing an email and extracting different information to evaluate the impact of the attack, the decision tree will do a check on some of the values parsed in order to understand which path to take, escalation and creation of ticket or not.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 21 - DLP Alert

1. Gathers enrichment information on the source user name and source address.
1. Queries threat intelligence for the destination address and upgrades incident priority for known threats. Prompts with a user choice decision to block the destination address.
1. Queries EDR for processes accessing the file (by hash), then checks any processes against threat intelligence. Prompts with a user choice decision to block the process by hash if the process is a known threat.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 24 - DoS with Decision Tree

*Denial of Service*

This playbook is built to prevent DoS/DDoS attacks. Once the Cloud SOAR receives an alert, it collects the first information regarding the impact of the attack, the interfaces involved, and the list of the history commands. We inform our SOC by sending an email. Next, the playbook collects all the information from all the actions from the previous nodes and proceeds with additional activities (execution of custom scripts, running SELECT query into the DB, and so on).

Once we have all the information that we need, we conduct extra CTI activities to verify if the IoC's are malicious or not. Then we can proceed taking a decision by running an additional playbook ([20 - Decision tree for DOS](#20---decision-tree-for-dos) in our case). Once the decision is tacked, we can inform the technician or execute additional commands, depending on the result of the previous playbook execution. Lastly, the playbook sends a summary and creates a user choice.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 25 - XSS Prevention

*Denial of Service*

XSS Attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious Javascript code is injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, to a server, or computer. This playbook can help enrich, contain, and notify as needed.

### 36 - GDPR Data Breach

The [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/) emphasizes transparency, security, and accountability by data controllers, while at the same time standardizing and strengthening the right of European citizens to data privacy. It also extends to non-EU businesses that process the personal data of EU residents. It introduces the role of Data Protection Officer (DPO), which is required for "government bodies" and organizations conducting mass surveillance or mass processing of special categories of data. Additionally, it generally requires that organizations need a personal information inventory.

GDPR imposes mandatorily to report privacy breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours and potentially to the data subject. GDPR requests organizations should perform Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) if the activity is considered "high-risk". A PIA is a process of systematically considering the potential impact of a new event (for example, deploying a new technology) on the privacy data exposure of individuals. It allows organizations to identify potential privacy issues before they arise and come up with a plan to mitigate them.

Failing to report a breach to the supervisory authority can imply a penalty that can be up to 20,000,000 EUR or 4 percent of the previous year's global revenue. Typical cases that might imply data breach:
- Intrusion
- Theft/loss of mobile or PC
- Accidental distribution of data (wrong recipient or wrong attachment)
- Loss of digital supports or paper documents
- System failure with loss of data (for example, database crash)

This playbook is purely for guidance and is intended as general information. It does not constitute legal advice or legal analysis. All organizations that process data need to be aware that the General Data Protection Regulation will apply directly to them.

### 148 - SolarWind Orion - Exploit Prevention

*Intrusion*

This playbook remediates a possible SolarWinds exploitation leveraging the backdoors SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA. Playbook receives alerts from Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM monitoring the network traffic and all security events into SolarWinds.

If the traffic contains the known C&C server "avsvmcloud.com" or the Orion software is not updated, the incident is confirmed as a TRUE POSITIVE and the mitigation starts. It analyzes SolarWinds compromised hosts and powers down network interfaces, ending with a network block containment action.

If the condition is false and the network traffic does not contact the C&C server, a custom action checks for updates on the Orion website, monitors network traffic, and creates a useful note where it is explained how the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities work. Two user choices are used to verify the impacted versions and the presence of the malicious web shell DLL `app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll` on the suspect server. If the SOC analyst answers yes, an automated scan will be executed to check the presence of specific CVEs. Otherwise the case is classified as FALSE POSITIVE.

Finally, as a last task, the playbook creates a ticket for the NOC (in their JIRA) to monitor the Microsoft 365 Cloud because FireEye researchers have discovered that SolarWinds attackers can move laterally from local networks into the Microsoft 365 cloud.

### 162 - SolarWinds Orion - Exploit Mitigation (Supervised Active Intelligence)

*Intrusion*

This playbook allows you to check for, prevent, and contain potential SolarWinds SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA exploitations. The playbook starts by exploring traffic and searching for relevant alerts. It then creates a manual task to check the updates on the involved servers or workstations. If the traffic from SolarWinds Orion contains the known C&C server `avsvmcloud.com` or the Orion software is not updated, the playbook will:
1. Conduct a forensic investigation.
1. Examine compromised SolarWinds hosts.
1. Power down network interfaces, ending with a network block containment action.

Alternatively, if there are no traces of the aforementioned C&C server, the playbook proceeds to verify the Orion updates and traffic. In addition, it incorporates a helpful note that explains how the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities work.

Subsequently, the playbook presents the analyst with two user choices. The first checks the SolarWinds Orion version, and the second looks to verify the presence of the malicious web-shell DLL `app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll` on the servers. In case the SOC analyst confirms the SolarWinds versions are vulnerable and the malicious file is present, the playbook executes an automatic scan to check for the presence of specific CVEs.

Lastly, since FireEye researchers have discovered that SolarWinds attackers can move laterally from local networks to the Microsoft 365 cloud, the playbook asks the analyst to monitor Microsoft 365 cloud.

### 311 - Privilege Escalation in AWS - Unauthorized Access

*Unauthorized Access*

This playbook enriches suspicious events of possible unauthorized access in AWS. It activates when an external IP adds a user to a privileged group (domain admins or similar).

Starting with a Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM insight, a high fidelity alert, the playbook begins by saving the access logs in AWS and the duplicated IPs from the events in a CSV file. Once all the IOCs contained within the alert from the original Cloud SIEM insight have been collected, the playbook carries out two different IP reputation checks using XForce and AbuseIPDB and obtains two different results using Whois and XForce. Next, the playbook automatically gets the user groups and attributes of the affected user from AWS IAM and automatically analyzes what is collected through a machine choice action.

If the IP reputation has a negative score, the analyst can immediately notify the SOC team and AWS IAM administrator about the compromised user, creating a personalized note with all the details about the user. Finally, through user choice, which is an analyst decision, you can perform automatic containment, orchestrating AWS IAM and Checkpoint Firewall. The first allows you to remove the user from the group and delete the login profile and the access key, while the second allows you to block the external IP. Alternatively, you can decide to apply manual containment, and an automatically assigned task will appear in the SecOps Dashboard of the analyst. If the IP was considered non-harmful, the SOC team would be notified, and the incident will be marked as a False Positive.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 331 - DoS With Decision Tree Advanced

*Denial of Service*

The purpose of this playbook is to prevent DoS/DDoS attacks. When Cloud SOAR receives an alert, it tries to collect initial information regarding the impact of the DoS/DDoS attack and notifies the SOC team if some information is missing. It then gathers data about the involved interfaces and command history and sends the information to the SOC team through email.

Next, the playbook collects all the information from all the previous actions, after which it proceeds with additional activities (that is, execution of custom scripts, running SELECT query into the DB, and so on). After the playbook provides all the necessary information, it allows the analysts to conduct extra CTI activities to verify whether the IoCs are malicious, enabling them to decide on the following action by running an additional playbook ([20 - Decision tree for DOS](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/playbooks-in-app-central/#20---decision-tree-for-dos) in our case).

Once they decide, the playbook can inform the technician or execute additional cmd, depending on the result of the previous playbook execution. Lastly, the playbook sends an incident summary and creates a user choice.

It introduces the role of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), required for government bodies and organizations conducting mass surveillance or mass processing of special categories of data. Additionally, it generally requires that organizations need a personal information inventory.

GDPR imposes mandatorily to report privacy breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours and potentially to the data subject. GDPR requests organizations to perform Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) if the activity is considered high-risk. A PIA is a process of systematically considering the potential impact of a new event (for example, deploying a new technology) on the private data exposure of individuals. It allows organizations to identify potential privacy issues before they arise and devise a plan to mitigate these threats.

Failing to report a breach to the supervisory authority can imply a penalty of up to 20,000,000 EUR or four percent of the previous year's global revenue. Typical cases that might end in a data breach are the following:
* Intrusion
* Theft/loss of mobile or PC
* Accidental distribution of data (wrong recipient or wrong attachment)
* Loss of digital supports or paper documents
* System failure with loss of data (for example, database crash)

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 430 - Security Awareness AD Advanced

*KB4 Completed*

This playbook adds or removes a user from an AD group. Once it parses a particular email, the playbook automatically checks whether the user retrieved from the email body is part of the AD group. If it is, it removes it (from the group). Otherwise, the playbook sends a notification and asks the analyst to perform a manual check. If the user is definitely not found, the incident closes automatically. If, on the other hand, it finds the user, the playbook sends a notification to the duty engineers regardless of whether the containment action succeeded or failed.

<SamplePlaybooks/>

### 431 - Phishing Triage Playbook Advanced

This playbook analyzes the logs presented on Alleantia and Cyber Vision for an exceeded threshold after a defined period. It includes an additional condition for event information and enrichment validation. If the logs present sufficient suspicious information (for example, unknown host, a higher number of activities, and so on), the playbook gives the possibility to take two possible ways:
* Perform an additional query using a nested playbook and execute all the containment actions
* Mark the host as trusted and update Cisco Cyber Vision with the new trusted host information

If the initial condition fails, the playbook allows the user to reset the machine parameters through an additional user choice.

### 435 - Insider Threat Advanced

*General*

This playbook helps prevent suspicious user activities. Once the original alert is received, the playbook checks all user properties in AD. Then, it sets a conditional validation of user details.

If the traffic from SolarWinds Orion contains the known C&C server "avsvmcloud.com" or the Orion software is not updated, the playbook will:
* Conduct a forensic investigation.
* Examine compromised SolarWinds hosts.
* Power down network interfaces, ending with a network block containment action.

Alternatively, if there are no traces of the C&C server mentioned above, the playbook verifies the Orion updates and traffic. In addition, it incorporates a helpful note that explains how the SUNBURST and SUPERNOVA vulnerabilities work.

Subsequently, the playbook presents the analyst with two user choices: the first checks the SolarWinds Orion version and the second looks to verify the presence of the malicious web-shell DLL "app_web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll" on the servers. If the SOC analyst confirms the SolarWinds versions are vulnerable, and the malicious file is present, the playbook executes an automatic scan to check for specific CVEs.

Lastly, since FireEye researchers have discovered that SolarWinds attackers can move laterally from local networks to the Microsoft 365 cloud, the playbook asks the analyst to monitor Microsoft 365 cloud.

### 478 - CrowdStrike Detections — Compromised User — Triage

*Malicious Activity*

This playbook will be triggered by CrowdStrike alerts with low and medium severity. It extracts the compromised user account from the alert, searches into Azure AD for the user contact details and department, and then creates a note with the compromised user's details. Further, based on the user's department, the playbook retrieves the ISO from the Sharepoint list, searches for the ISO details in Azure AD, and then creates a note with the ISO contact details.

Afterward, the playbook prompts the analyst to contact and inform the ISO. The options are:
* Send a notification to ISO automatically and create a note that ISO was notified.
* Send a notification to ISO manually and create a note that ISO was notified.
* Create a note that ISO was not notified.
