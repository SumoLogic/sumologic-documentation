**Bring your own AI to the Dojo**. Connect your AI tools directly to Sumo Logic to create a unified ecosystem powered by your observability and security data.

The Sumo Logic MCP Server makes Dojo AI the central hub of your AI ecosystem using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of building custom integrations or treating Sumo Logic as a separate data silo, you can connect your own copilots, proprietary models, and third-party AI systems directly to Sumo Logic's capabilities.

Our MCP Server integrates seamlessly with [Query Agent](#) and [Knowledge Agent](#), enabling your external AI tools to collaborate with these agents. As new agents become available (such as the upcoming SOC Analyst Agent), they will also integrate with the MCP Server.

<summary>What is Model Context Protocol?</summary>

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that defines how AI models, agents, and tools share context and communicate with one another. It provides a consistent framework for connecting LLMs, copilots, and specialized agents.

By implementing MCP, Sumo Logic enables your AI ecosystem to exchange data, context, and instructions with Dojo AI in real time, without complex custom integrations or workarounds.
</details>

## How it works

The MCP Server provides a standardized interface between Sumo Logic and your AI tools:

1. **Connect your AI tools** using the MCP standard.
1. **Query with natural language** to analyze data using Sumo Logic's capabilities.
1. **Execute prompts across environments**—IDEs, collaboration tools, or custom applications.
1. **Leverage Dojo AI agents** alongside your own models for unified analysis and response.

Your external AI systems can query logs, manage insights, analyze dashboards, and update records—all through a single, consistent protocol.

## Prerequisites

The Sumo Logic MCP Server is a fully managed gateway that integrates securely with Sumo Logic platform APIs and Dojo AI agents. To connect your AI tools to this gateway, you'll deploy orchestrator agents in your environment.

### Architecture

* **Sumo Logic provides** the MCP Server gateway (fully managed).
* **You deploy** orchestrator agents that connect to the gateway.
* **Powered by** Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

For example, to enable MCP in Slack, you would deploy an orchestrator agent on AWS AgentCore runtime. This agent communicates with Sumo Logic's MCP Server gateway via standard MCP protocol, which then securely accesses Sumo Logic APIs and Dojo AI agents.

### Setup requirements

* MCP-compatible client application (Slack bot, IDE assistant, or custom application).
* Orchestrator agent deployment platform (such as AWS AgentCore runtime).
* Sumo Logic credentials for authentication.

Detailed configuration guides will be available as the feature becomes more widely available.

## What you can do

* **Bring the best AI for your stack**. Integrate proprietary models or third-party copilots with Sumo Logic's observability and security data while maintaining the scale, consistency, and security of a unified platform.
* **Accelerate workflows with AI assistance**. Use Sumo Logic's telemetry as input for your AI-driven workflows, enabling faster investigations and response with analysts staying in control of critical decisions.
* **Work where you work**. Execute AI-powered queries from your IDE, collaboration tools like Slack, or custom applications without needing to switch contexts.
* **Future-proof your strategy**. Add new AI technologies as they emerge while maintaining Sumo Logic's scale, security, and data governance.

## Example use cases

### Investigate security incidents without leaving Slack

When your team receives a Cloud SIEM alert in Slack, your AI assistant can:

* Retrieve triage details and severity assessments generated by SOC Analyst Agent.
* Search related entities (user accounts, IP addresses, system assets, attack chain context).
* Query raw logs to find if other users experienced similar activity.
* Update insight status (from new to in progress to closed).
* Add investigation notes and comments for team visibility.

All of this happens conversationally in your Slack channel, with multi-tool calls handled automatically behind the scenes.

**Example workflow:**

```
User: @bot what are the triage details? update the status to in progress

Bot: I've retrieved the triage information and updated the status to In Progress.

Verdict: MALICIOUS - Confirmed threat
Severity: CRITICAL

Key Evidence:
1. Phishing Email with Fake AWS Console URL
2. Credential Harvesting - User dan.kent credentials stolen
3. Post-Compromise Activity - AWS IAM user used for enumeration
...
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="IDE">

* **Query logs from your development environment**. Connect GitHub Copilot or your IDE's AI assistant to Sumo Logic so you can troubleshoot production issues without leaving your code editor. Ask questions in natural language and get query results informed by Sumo Logic's analytics.
* **Debug with full context**. When investigating errors or performance issues, your IDE can pull relevant logs, traces, and metrics from Sumo Logic directly into your development workflow.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="SOC">

* **Unified threat investigation**. Connect your security copilot to Sumo Logic so it can query threat data, correlate signals, and access insights from SOC Analyst Agent for faster triage and response.
* **AI-assisted playbook execution**. Integrate your SOAR platform to trigger Sumo Logic queries and analysis as part of incident response playbooks. Your AI tools surface insights and recommendations while analysts maintain oversight of response actions.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Custom">

* **Proprietary model integration**. Use your custom-trained models alongside Sumo Logic's agents, combining specialized domain knowledge with Sumo Logic's log analytics and security insights.
* **Cross-platform orchestration**. Build workflows that span multiple AI tools and data sources, with Sumo Logic as the central hub for observability and security context.

## When to use External MCP (and when not to)

Use External MCP for:

* **Conversational investigations**. Interactive queries and analysis through chat interfaces like Slack or IDE assistants.
* **Multi-step workflows**. Combining multiple operations (query, update, comment) in a single natural language request.
* **Real-time collaboration**. Getting AI-powered insights during team discussions in collaboration tools.
* **Agent-to-agent communication**. Connecting your AI assistants with Sumo Logic's Dojo AI agents.

External MCP is designed for conversational, agent-level interaction where AI tools need to query Sumo Logic intelligently. For raw data access, our standard APIs are more efficient and cost-effective.

Do NOT use External MCP for:

* **Bulk data extraction**. Use the [Search Job API](/docs/api/search-job) instead for retrieving large volumes of data.
* **Model training**. Use the [Search Job API](/docs/api/search-job) to pull data for training your own models (note: 100,000 record limit per job).
* **High-volume automated queries**. MCP has significant token consumption costs that make it impractical for bulk operations.


## Security and data governance

Our MCP Server maintains Sumo Logic's strict security and compliance standards:

* **Permissioned access**. All integrations occur through secure, controlled interfaces.
* **Data sovereignty**. Your data never leaves your control.
* **No model training**. Customer data is never used to train AI models.
* **Audit trails**. All MCP interactions are logged for compliance and security review.
* **Multi-tenant isolation**. The MCP Server acts as a gateway with tenant-level security controls.

The MCP Server acts as a secure bridge, letting you extend your AI ecosystem without compromising visibility, control, or compliance.
