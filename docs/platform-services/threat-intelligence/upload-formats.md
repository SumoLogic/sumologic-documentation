import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Use the following formats for threat intelligence indicator files when you [add indicators in the Threat Intelligence tab](/docs/platform-services/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-indicators/#add-indicators-in-the-threat-intelligence-tab) or when you use the upload APIs in the [Threat Intel Ingest Management](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#tag/threatIntelIngest) API resource:

* [Normalized JSON format](#normalized-json-format)
* [CSV format](#csv-format)
* [STIX 2.x JSON format](#stix-2x-json-format)

## Normalized JSON format

Normalized JSON format is a standardized method to present JSON data. You can use this format to load indicators from multiple sources.

### Example file

Following is an example threat indicator file in normalized JSON format. (For another example, see the [uploadNormalizedIndicators API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/uploadNormalizedIndicators)).

```
{
 "indicators": [
   {
     "id": "0001",
     "indicator": "192.0.2.0",
     "type": "ipv4-addr:value",
     "source": "FreeTAXII",
     "validFrom": "2023-03-21T12:00:00.000Z",
     "validUntil": "2025-03-21T12:00:00.000Z",
     "confidence": 30,
     "threatType": "malicious-activity",
     "actors": "actor1,actor2",
     "killChain": "reconnaissance",
     "fields": {
       "kill_chain_name": "lockheed-martin-cyber-kill-chain",
       "kill_chain_phase": "reconnaissance"
     }
   },
   {
     "id": "0002",
     "indicator": "192.0.2.1",
     "type": "ipv4-addr:value",
     "source": "FreeTAXII",
     "validFrom": "2023-03-21T12:00:00.000Z",
     "validUntil": "2025-03-21T12:00:00.000Z",
     "confidence": 30,
     "threatType": "malicious-activity",
     "actors": "actor3,actor4",
     "killChain": "reconnaissance",
     "fields": {
       "kill_chain_name": "lockheed-martin-cyber-kill-chain",
       "kill_chain_phase": "reconnaissance"
     }
   }
 ]
}
```

### Required attributes

For information about the attributes to use, see ["Indicator" in the STIX 2.1 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_muftrcpnf89v), and the [uploadNormalizedIndicators API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/uploadNormalizedIndicators) in the [Threat Intel Ingest Management](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#tag/threatIntelIngest) API resource.

The following attributes are required:
       * **id** (string). ID of the indicator. For example, `indicator--d81f86b9-975b-4c0b-875e-810c5ad45a4f`.

       * **confidence** (integer [ 1 .. 100 ]). Confidence that the creator has in the correctness of their data, where 100 is highest (as [defined by the confidence scale in STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_1v6elyto0uqg)). For example, `75`.
       * **threatType** (string). Type of indicator (as [defined by indicator_types in STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/os/stix-v2.1-os.html#_cvhfwe3t9vuo)). For example, `malicious-activity`. (This attribute can result in a special label appearing next to Entities in the Cloud SIEM UI. See [View threat indicators in the Cloud SIEM UI](/docs/platform-services/threat-intelligence/threat-indicators-in-cloud-siem/#view-threat-indicators-in-the-cloud-siem-ui).) <br/>Following are valid values:

## CSV format

Comma-separated value (CSV) is a standard format for data upload.

### Example files

#### Upload with the UI

If uploading a CSV file with the UI, the format should be the same as used for a standard CSV file:

```
0001,192.0.2.0,ipv4-addr:value,FreeTAXII,2023-02-21T12:00:00.00Z,2025-05-21T12:00:00.00Z,30,malicious-activity,,
0002,192.0.2.1,ipv4-addr:value,FreeTAXII,2023-02-21T12:00:00.00Z,2025-05-21T12:00:00.00Z,30,malicious-activity,actor3,reconnaissance
```

#### Upload with the API

If uploading a CSV file using the API, the file should be contained in a JSON object like this:

```
{
 "csv": "0001,192.0.2.0,ipv4-addr,FreeTAXII,2023-02-21T12:00:00.00Z,2025-05-21T12:00:00.00Z,3,malicious-activity,,\n
0002,192.0.2.1,ipv4-addr,FreeTAXII,2023-02-21T12:00:00.00Z,2025-05-21T12:00:00.00Z,3,malicious-activity,actor3,reconnaissance\n"
}
```

For other examples for uploading CSV files using the API, see the [uploadCsvIndicators API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/uploadCsvIndicators) and the [uploadBlobIndicators API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/uploadBlobIndicators).

## STIX 2.x JSON format

STIX 2.x JSON format is a method to present JSON data according to the STIX 2.x specification.

Note that if you want to upload indicators from multiple sources, you cannot use this format but instead should use the [Normalized JSON format](#normalized-json-format).

Also note that if your STIX file includes lines like these at the top...

```
{
  "type": "bundle",
  "id": "bundle--cf20f99b-3ed2-4a9f-b4f1-d660a7fc8241",
  "objects": [
  {
    "type": "indicator",
```

...you should remove them before uploading the file, and leave only the objects array like this:

```
[
  {
    "type": "indicator",
```


### Example files

#### Upload with the UI

Following is an example threat indicator file in STIX 2.1 JSON format if you're uploading a file with the UI.

If you are uploading via the UI, do not include the `source` value in the file, since the UI prompts for the source value when you [add the indicator](/docs/platform-services/threat-intelligence/threat-intelligence-indicators/#add-indicators-in-the-threat-intelligence-tab).

```

         "phase_name": "reconnaissance"
       }
     ]
   },

     ]
   }
 ]
 ```

#### Upload with the API

Following is an example threat indicator file in STIX 2.1 JSON format if you're uploading a file with the API.

As shown in the following example, if uploading via the API you must add the `source` attribute outside of the indicators object, since the source is not part of the STIX standard. You must also include an `indicators` array field. (For another example for uploading via the API, see the [uploadStixIndicators API](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#operation/uploadStixIndicators)).

```

     ]
   }
