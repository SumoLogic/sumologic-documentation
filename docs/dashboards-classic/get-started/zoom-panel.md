# Zoom in on a Panel

The **Zoom** icon allows you to zoom in on a single Panel from a Dashboard for a better view. Once it is opened, the zoomed Panel fills the browser window.

When you are viewing a zoomed Panel, you can also [pause](pause-panel.md) the data streaming in to the Panel. Instead of viewing the real time search results, you can get a static view. When you are ready, you can return to real time with the click of a button.

Make sure the Edit toggle is off.

To zoom in on a Panel:

1. In a Dashboard (either published or owned by yourself) hover over the name of a Panel, then click the **Zoom** icon:
