# Launch a Search from a Data Panel

Whether you're working with a Dashboard you designed or from a published Dashboard, you can click a data point in a Panel to launch a search from that point in time in the **Search** page. This is especially useful in situations where you've noticed activity in a Panel that you'd like to research further.

After running the search you can save the query as a new Panel, or save any changes you've made to the search back to the existing Panel.

Make sure the Edit toggle is off.

1.  Click a data section of a chart in a Panel.
1.  Click **OK** to confirm the search.

The search begins. Results are displayed in the **Aggregates** tab of the **Search** page.
