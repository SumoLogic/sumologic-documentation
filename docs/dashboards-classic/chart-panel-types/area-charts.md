# Area Charts

An area chart is used to visually represent quantity over a period of time. The quantity is laid out on the vertical axis, and the horizontal axis shows the time period being charted. What distinguishes an area chart from a line chart is the use of shaded regions below the line which better indicates the increase or decrease of volume. 

:::note
The number of data points on a dashboard panel is limited to 1,000, and therefore only 1,000 data points are shown on a chart panel in dashboards.

To create an area chart, you must use a query that provides more than one data point in the **Aggregates** tab. Then the line is drawn between the data points to show the change.

For example, you could use the following query to create an area chart:

```sql
error | timeslice 1m | count by _timeslice
```

which would produce results such as:

To create an Area Chart:

1. Run a query.
1. In the **Aggregates** tab, choose the **Area Chart** icon to display the search results.

The data in the **Aggregates** tab is represented as an area chart.
