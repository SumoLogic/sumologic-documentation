You can include a variety of chart types in your Dashboards.

All chart types require aggregated data.Â 

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>

See [Edit Dashboards and Panels](/docs/dashboards-classic/edit-dashboards) for options to view and edit settings.
