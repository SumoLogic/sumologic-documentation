This page describes updates to the Sumo Logic Metrics Engine, and how your existing metrics queries might be affected by the changes.

## Change to metadata in aggregate query results

The first change affects how the `metric` dimension is labeled in the results of queries that perform an aggregation function, such as `avg`, `count`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `pct`.

### Current behavior  

Currently, the `metric` dimension shown in aggregate query results depends on whether the query returns one or multiple values for the `metric` dimension.

* If query results include only one value for the `metric` dimension, the resulting `metric` dimension includes the aggregation function (in the case of `pct`, suffixed with its parameter) and the original `metric` dimension. For example, given the query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=host/metrics metric=CPU_Idle | pct(10)
```

In the time series returned, the metric dimension is labeled:
```sql
pct_10.0(CPU_Idle)
```

* If query results include multiple values of the `metric` dimension, the resulting `metric` dimension is just the name of the aggregation function, for example `max`. If the aggregation function is `pct`, will be suffixed with its parameter. For example, given the query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=host/metrics (metric=CPU_Idle or metric=CPU_user) | pct(10)
```

In the time series returned, the `metric` dimension would be labeled:

```sql
pct_10.0
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/v1-multiple-metrics.png')} alt="line-commented.png" />


### New behavior

With this change, the output `metric` dimension will always contain just the name of the aggregation function (or in the case of `pct`, the name of the aggregation function, suffixed by its parameter), regardless of the number of unique metric dimensions returned by the query. If you want to include the name of the input metric as well, you must append `by metric` to the query. (Note that if there are multiple `metric` values in the input time series, more groups will be created).

Given the query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=host/metrics metric=CPU_Idle | pct(10)
```

In the time series returned, the `metric` dimension would be labeled, like this, without the input metric:

```sql
pct_10.0
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/v2-default.png')} alt="line-commented.png" />


With the `by metric` clause added to the query:

```sql
_sourceCategory=host/metrics metric=CPU_Idle | pct(10) by metric
```

In the time series returned, the `metric` dimension would be labeled:

```sql
pct_10.0(CPU_Idle)
```

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/v2-by-metric.png')} alt="line-commented.png" />


### How to change queries to ensure metadata is unchanged in results

* If a metric query returns only a single value of a `metric` dimension – for example, just `CPU_Idle` – you must append `by metric` to the query to ensure that the metric dimension will still be labeled with the aggregation function and the metric name, for example `pct_10.0(CPU_Idle)`.
* If a metric query returns multiple values of a metric dimension–for example, `CPU_Idle and CPU_User`– no change to the query is required.


### Changes to reducer functions

The Sumo Logic metric query language supports the following reducer functions: `eval`, `filter`, `topk`, `bottomk`.

Queries that meet all the following conditions will be affected by this change.

* Don’t contain an explicit `quantize using <agg>` statement (where `<agg>` is a quantization method).
* Do contain a reducer function that uses at least one of these aggregation functions: `min`, `max`, `sum`, `count`.
* The quantization used on the selector level (implicitly or explicitly) is less granular than the reporting interval. Of course, it depends on the underlying data, but typically, the quantization must be bigger than 1 minute so that a query can be affected.

For example, this query meets the conditions above, and so would be affected by the v2 change (typically, as stated above, it depends on the underlying data):

```sql
metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m | filter min > 20 and max < 50
```

### Current behavior

In the example query above, we use the `filter` qualifiers from the query (`min` and `max`) as the quantization method, and hence do two quantizations (`min` and `max`) on all raw data points. The `filter` function is applied across those results. In other words the reducing function operates on “real” minimum and maximum values (in this example) across all raw data points.

The query results that appear on the chart view are based upon quantizing the data using `avg`.


### New behavior

We use `avg` as the quantization method:

* if the query does not contain using `<agg>` (because `avg` is the default when method is not specified), or
* if the query does contain `using avg`.

If another quantization method is explicitly specified in the query, for example `using sum`, we use that method.

The example query is effectively rewritten from:

```sql
metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m | filter min > 20 and max < 50
```

to

```sql
metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m using avg | filter min > 20 and max < 50
```

As a result, the minimum and maximum values used for filtering will be the minimum and maximum values of the averages of 15 minute buckets.


#### How to change existing queries to ensure quantization behavior is unchanged

To preserve the previous behavior, you can rewrite the query to use a join. For example:

You could rewrite this query:

```sql
metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m | filter min > 20
```

as the three queries shown below. (The third query, #C, joins the two queries above it.)

#A    `metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m using min | filter min > 20 | eval 1`

#B    `metric=CPU_Idle | quantize to 15m`

#C    `#A * #B along <dimensions>`

Where `<dimensions>` is the dimension (or dimensions) that uniquely identifies the time series in the results. Which dimensions uniquely identify your time series depends on your underlying data. Keep in mind that because metrics are typically generated by an entity–a particular host, Kubernetes pod, cluster, and so on–the dimension(s) that identify the entity that generates a metric should also identify the metrics it generates. For metrics generated by a Sumo Logic Host Metrics Source, the `_sourceHost` metadata field is a unique identifier. For metrics generated by Kubernetes pods, `pod` should do the trick.
