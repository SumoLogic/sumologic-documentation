# Metrics Operators

The following table lists the metrics supported operators and provides examples of queries containing each type of operator. 

| Operator | Description and Syntax | Examples |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [accum](accum.md) | Converts each time-series in the row to a series of running totals. The running total in each series starts from the value of the first data point in the series, then iteratively adds up successive values.<br/>For example, if `RequestCount` is:<br/>`{ 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0 }`<br/>`RequestCount | accum` is:<br/> `{ 2, 2, 6, 9, 9, 9 }`<br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `RequestCount | accum` |
| [avg](avg.md) | Calculates the average of all the resulting time series. If grouping is specified, it calculates the average for each group.<br/>`avg [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]`<br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `dep=prod metric=cpu_system | avg`<br/>`cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | avg by node` |
| [along](along.md) | For use when joining metric queries, results in the Sumo evaluating the summation expression by one or more metric fields.<br/>`#A + #B along [FIELD (,FIELD, ...]]` | Given joined metric queries like this: `metric=CPU_User _sourceHost=cqsplitter-*`<br/>`metric=CPU_Sys _sourceHost=cqsplitter-* #A + #B along _sourceHost`<br/>The along operator causes the summation to be performed for time series whose `_sourceHost` value matches. |
| [bottomk](bottomk.md) | Select the bottom specified time series sorted by the value of a mathematical expression evaluated over the query time range.<br/>`bottomk (number, aggregator)`<br/>Supported aggregate functions:<br/>`min`, `max`, `avg`, `count`, `sum`, `pct(n)`, `latest`<br/>Available in advanced query mode. Only simple aggregators supported (excluding pct) and no multiple dimensions in basic mode. | Take the bottom 5 time series with the highest maximum value:<br/>`dep=prod metric=cpu_system | bottomk (5, max)` |
| [count](count.md) | Counts the total number of time series that match the query. If grouping is specified, it counts the total number for each group.<br/>`count [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]`<br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `dep=prod | count`<br/>`cluster=search | count by node` |
| [delta](delta.md) | Computes the backward difference at each data point in the time series to determine how much the metric has changed from its last value in the series.<br/>This operator also assigns the value of the metric tag to be `delta($metric)`.<br/>​​​​​​​Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `metric=Net_InBytes Interface=eth0 | delta` |
| [eval](eval.md) | Evaluates a time series based on a user-specified math expression.<br/>`metrics query | eval <math expression>`<br/>where math expression is a valid math expression with `_value` as the placeholder for each data point in the time series.<br/>Supported Basic operations:<br/>`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`<br/>Supported Math functions:<br/>`sin`, `cos`, `abs`, `log`, `round`, `ceil`, `floor`, `tan`, `exp`, `sqrt`, `min`, `max` <br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. In advanced, expression terms must be separated by whitespace. | `_sourceCategory=ApacheHttpServer metrics=request_per_sec | rate | eval max(_value, 0) _sourceCategory=ApacheHttpServer metrics=cpu_idle | eval _value * 100` |
| [fillmissing](fillmissing.md) | Fills empty time slices in metric query results with a derived data point. You can choose between several methods of deriving a data point, or leave empty timeslices empty.<br/>`metric query | fillmissing [using] <empty | interpolation | last | fixed>`<br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `_sourceCategory=Labs/VMWare6.5/Metrics hostname=thisveryhost metric=cpu_ready | fillmissing interpolation` |
| [filter](filter.md) | Filters a query to help reduce the number of series returned by applying a boolean test to some aggregate quantity.<br/>`filter <aggregator> <boolean operator> <numerical value>`<br/>Supported aggregate functions:<br/>`min`, `max`, `avg`, `count`, `sum`, `pct(n)`, `latest`<br/>When you use `max` as the aggregation function for `filter`, you must set an upper limit, as shown in the second example in the "Examples" column to the right.<br/>​​​​​​​Basic query mode supports only a simplified form (x >= avg). | Show only cpu metrics whose average over the time range queried is greater than 80%<br/>`cpu | filter avg > 80`<br/>Show only cpu metrics where the min is greater than 20% and the max less than 50%<br/>`cpu | filter min > 20 and max < 50` |
| [max](max.md) | Calculates the maximum value of the time series that match the query. If grouping is specified, it calculates the maximum for each group.<br/>`max [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]` | `dep=prod metric=cpu_system | max`<br/>`cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | max by node` |
| [min](min.md) | Calculates the minimum value of the time series that match the query. If grouping is specified, it calculates the minimum for each group.<br/>`min [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]` | `dep=prod metric=cpu_system | min`<br/>`cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | min by node` |
| [outlier](outlier.md) | Identifies metrics data points that are outside the range of expected values.<br/>​​​​​​​Available in basic and advanced query modes. Basic mode does not support `window` and `threshold`. | `_sourceCategory=hostmetrics _sourceHost=nxPTY | outlier` |
| [parse] | Parses the given field to create new fields to use in the metrics query. If no field is specified while parsing [Graphite metrics] (/03Send-Data/Sources/01Sources-for-Installed-Collectors/Streaming-Metrics-Source), the metric name is used.<br/>Each wildcard in the pattern corresponds to a specified field. The parse operator supports both lazy (shortest match) and greedy (longest match) wildcard matches. Use '*' for a lazy match, or '**' for a greedy match.<br/>`parse [field=FIELD] PATTERN as FIELD [, FIELD, ...]`Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `dep=prod | parse *-search-* as deployment, instance`<br/>`cluster=frontend | parse field=user **-* as user_id, user_type` |
| [pct](pct.md) | Calculates the specified percentile of the metrics that match the query. If grouping is specified, it calculates the specified percentile for each group.<br/>`pct(DOUBLE) [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]`​
Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `dep=prod metric=cpu_system | pct(95)`<br/>`cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | pct(99.9) by node` |
| [quantize](quantize.md) | Segregates time series data by time period. This allows you to create aggregated results in buckets of fixed intervals (for example, 5-minute intervals).<br/>`quantize to INTERVAL [using ROLLUP]`<br/>where `ROLLUP` is `avg`, `min`, `max`, `sum` or `count`.<br/>For information about quantization, see [Metric Quantization](/Metrics/Introduction-to-Metrics/Metric_Quantization). ​​​​​​​Available in basic and advanced query modes, excluding `drop last`. | `_sourceCategory=hostmetrics | quantize to 5m`<br/>`logins | quantize to 5m using sum` |
| [rate](rate.md) | Computes a rate based on the forward difference at each time in the time series. The difference between the current and the next recorded value in a time series is scaled to a value per second.<br/>This operator also assigns the value of the metric tag to be rate($metric) and the value of the unit metadata field to be $unit/second.<br/>`rate [increasing | decreasing]`<br/>With the increasing (or decreasing) option, the operator considers only those pairs of consecutive points where the second point in the pair is greater (or less) than the first point.<br/>​​​​​​​Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `metric=Net_InBytes Interface=eth0 | rate`<br/>`metric=Net_InBytes Interface=eth0 | rate increasing`<br/>`metric=Net_InBytes Interface=eth0 | rate decreasing` |
| [sum](sum.md) | Calculates the sum of the metrics values that match the query. If grouping is specified, it calculates the sum for each group.<br/>`sum [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]`<br/>Available in basic and advanced query modes. | `dep=prod metric=cpu_system | sum`<br/>`cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | sum by node` |
| timeshift | Shifts the time series from your metrics query by the specified amount of time. This can help when comparing a time series across multiple time periods.<br/>`timeshift TIME_INTERVAL	cluster=search metric=cpu_idle | timeshift 5h`<br/>`dep=prod metric=cpu_system | timeshift -1m` |
| [topk](topk.md) | Select the top specified time series sorted by the value of a mathematical expression evaluated over the query time range.<br/>`topk (number, aggregator)`<br/>Supported aggregate functions:<br/>`min`, `max`, `avg`, `count`, `sum`, `pct(n)`, `latest`<br/>​​​​​​​Available in basic and advanced query modes.​​​​​​​ Basic mode supports only simple aggregators (excluding pct) and no multiple dimensions. | Take the top 10 time series with the highest maximum value:<br/>`metric=cpu_system | topk (10, max)`<br/>Reduce each time series by calculating `(max / avg * 2)` for it. Sort by this reduced value and take the top 10 values:<br/>`metric=cpu_system |topk (10, max /avg * 2)` |
