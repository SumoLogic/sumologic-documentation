You can view your metrics data ingestion volume by navigating to **Administration > Account > Metrics Data Ingestion**. The screen provides a granular breakdown of your metrics ingestion and credits used. You can track consumption by individual metric names, or by specific dimensions and sources. With this data, you can see which sources and metrics contribute most to your credit consumption, and take necessary action. 

Understanding the volume of metrics that you are ingesting is important because when you exceed the credit limit, data is cached on the host and the source is throttled, reducing query performance and accuracy. For more information, see [Data Limits for Metrics](/docs/metrics/manage-metric-volume/data-limits-for-metrics/).

Data volume for metrics is often measured in data points per minute (DPM). A data point is an individual piece of data. The total number of data points being sent in a given time can give you a good idea of where the load is heaviest. For example, let's say you want to find out how much data is being sent to metrics from a certain source, host, or source category. You can look at the actual number of individual data points per minute being sent from these to determine whether they are consuming too much metrics bandwidth. Knowing the DPM for these and other kinds of data allows you to monitor your consumption rates.

While you can also see metrics ingestion breakdown in the [**Metrics** dashboard](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/data-volume/#metrics) of the Data Volume app, the dashboard only shows volume usage at a source category or source host level. Use the Metrics Data Ingestion screen to get more detailed information.

:::note
To see data volume, you'll need to enable [Audit Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-indexes/audit-index).

## View Metrics Data Ingestion

Navigate to **Administration > Account > Metrics Data Ingestion**.

 <img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/metrics-dpm.png')} alt="Metrics Data Ingestion screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

1. **Date and time**. Select a time to see the metrics gathered for the previous hour. 
1. **Ingest Trend for** `<date>`. The trend for ingest for the current day, broken down by hour. 
1. **Total Ingest Data Points (1 hr)**. The total number of data points ingested during the previous hour. The green up arrow indicates the total is higher than the previous hour, and a red down arrow indicates the total is lower than the previous hour. This lets you see at a glance whether volume rates are rising or falling.
1. **Ingest DPM (1 hr)**. The data points per minute (DPM) ingested during the previous hour.
1. **Ingest DPM (yesterday)**.  The average number of data points per minute (DPM) ingested during the previous day. 
1. **Total Ingest Data Points (yesterday)**. The total number of data points ingested during the previous day.
1. **Historical Trend**. The ingest trends over the last day or week. 
1. **Top 100 Data Points/min by Metric**. The top metrics that have the highest data points ingested. Click a specific metric on the diagram to see a breakdown of ingest for that metric.  
1. **Top 100 Data Points/min by Dimension**. The top data points per minute by dimension. Click a dimension on the diagram to see a breakdown of ingest.
1. **Top 100 Data Points/min by Source**. The top data points per minute by source. Click a source on the diagram to see a breakdown of ingest.
1. **Ingest per Metric**. The breakdown of information about data ingestion per metric. Click a line on the table to view ingest details for the metric. 
1. **Ingest per Dimension**. The breakdown of information about data ingestion per dimension. Click a line on the table to view ingest details for the dimension. 

## Query the sumologic_volume index

You can obtain the same information displayed on the Metrics Data Ingestion screen by querying the `sumologic_volume` index. Adjust the query as needed to perform custom analysis. Change the time range as needed (for example, to query for the last hour or 24 hours).

Following is an example query that lists the metric names that account for metrics data ingested arranged in descending order based on their DPM contribution. 

```
(_index=sumologic_volume _sourceCategory=byMetricDataPoints) 
| parse "intervalStart: *\n" as interval 
| parse regex "\n(?<singleRecord>.*)" multi 
| split singleRecord delim=';' extract 1 as metric, 2 as dpm 
| sum(dpm) as totalDp group by metric 
| round(totalDp / 60, 0) as dpm 
| order by dpm desc 
| fields -totalDp
```
Following is an example query that computes the average DPM ingestion for a given time period.
```
(_index=sumologic_volume _sourceCategory=byMetricDataPoints)
| parse "intervalStart: *\n" as interval
| parse regex "\n(?<singleRecord>.*)" multi
| split singleRecord delim=';' extract 1 as metric, 2 as dpCount
| num(dpCount)
| sum(dpCount) as dpm
| round(dpm / 60, 0) as dpm
```
