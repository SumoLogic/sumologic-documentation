The `in` operator functionality can be used in a metrics query selector as shorthand for multiple OR conditions.

## Syntax

`selectors dimension = (value1, value2, value3, â€¦)| metric query `

Where:

* `selectors` is one or more metadata key-value pairs or keywords that scope your query.
* `dimension` is the dimension (field) you want to match.
`value1`, `value2`, `value3`, and so on are values of dimension that you want to limit your query to.


## Example
This example will match time series in which the value of the `dimX` field is one of the strings in the array enclosed in parentheses.

```sql
metric=CPU_Total dimX=(123, 345, 567)
```
