```sql
max [by FIELD [, FIELD, ...]]
```

## Examples

### Maximum metric value across all matching time series

This query returns the maximum `CPU_Sys` value for each time interval
across all matching time series.

```sql
dep=prod metric=CPU_Sys | max
```

### Maximum metric value across by a tag value

This query returns the maximum `CPU_Sys` value by node for each time interval across all matching time series.

```sql
cluster=search metric=CPU_Sys | max by node
```
