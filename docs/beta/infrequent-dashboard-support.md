Previously, dashboards were only supported in Sumo Logicâ€™s Continuous data tier. Now, you can also setup dashboard panels that run against the Infrequent tier.

## Sample Queries

To use data from the Infrequent tier in your dashboard panels, you can use the following sample queries

 * Use `_dataTier=Infrequent` in your query scope. For example:

```sql
_dataTier=Infrequent _sourceCategory=appA "error"
```
Or, you can select data in the Infrequent tier by specifying the Partition that contains it, like this:

```sql
_index=some_infrequent_index
```

or


```sql
_index=some_infrequent_index OR _index=some_continuous_index
```


## Limitations  

* Auto-refesh is not available for dashboard panels running on Infrequent tier


## Infrequent Dashboard Usage

Sumo Logic provides a dashboard you can use to monitor the Infrequent tier consumption by saved Dashboards.

The dashboard presents the following information for the currently selected time range:

* **Avg Credits Consumed/Day**. The daily average number of credits consumed over the last 30 days.
* **Total Credits Consumed**. The total credits consumed in the last 30 days.
* **Top 50 Expensive Queries**. The top 50 expensive queries setup on Dashboards to run against Infrequent tier.

You can download the JSON for the dashboard [here](https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Infrequent_Dashboard.json). For information about importing dashboards and other content see [Import Content in the Library](/docs/get-started/library#import-content).
