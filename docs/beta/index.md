Learn about our Beta features are coming soon to general availability. Betas are different than our generally available services:

* We may make available to you a Preview, Limited Release, Alpha, Beta or other pre-release version of the service, applications, or APIs for non-production use (“Beta”).
* Betas may have limited features, functions, indexing capacity, storage, data security, data continuity, data retention or other limitations as determined by Sumo Logic.
* Sumo Logic may discontinue the Beta at any time.
* We may also decide never to make the features and functionality in Beta generally available.
* Betas (by their nature) have not been fully tested as they are still under development – and may be inoperable or incomplete, including more errors and bugs than our generally available offerings.
* Betas are offered “as is” with no warranties or indemnities.

:::note
Betas have additional terms and conditions for participation. You can opt-in to beta terms and conditions, so that you only need to agree to the terms once.
