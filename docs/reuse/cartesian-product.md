Use the **Cartesian product** checkbox with caution. Large array fields in the input can result in the action being called many times, causing the action to exceed the [actions limit](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/about-automation-service/#actions-limit). Only select this checkbox if you want to evaluate data from array input fields using the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) method. For example, suppose one input field is for signal name, and another is for signal value. If you have 2 arrays like this, and each array has 3 items, the Cartesian product evaluation pairs each item from the first set with each item from the second set, which will produce 9 pairs (3x3). Without Cartesian product evaluation, only matching position items are paired, which will produce 3 pairs (equal to the number of items).
