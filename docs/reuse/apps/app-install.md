1. Optionally, you can scroll down to preview the dashboards included with the app. Then, click **Install App** (sometimes this button says **Add Integration**).
    :::note
    If your app has multiple versions, you'll need to select the version of the service you're using before installation.
    :::
1. On the next configuration page, under **Select Data Source for your App**, complete the following fields:
   * **Data Source**. Select one of the following options:
      * Choose **Source Category** and select a source category from the list; or
      * Choose **Enter a Custom Data Filter**, and [enter a custom source category](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations#custom-data-filters) beginning with an underscore. For example, `_sourceCategory=MyCategory`.
   * **Folder Name**. You can retain the existing name or enter a custom name of your choice for the app.
   * **All Folders** (optional). Default location is the **Personal** folder in your **Library**. If desired, you can choose a different location and/or click **New Folder** to add it to a new folder.
1. Click **Next**.
1. Look for the dialog confirming that your app was installed successfully.<br/><img src="/img/get-started/library/app-success.png" alt="app-success.png" width="80%" />

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder or the folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with other users in your organization. Dashboard panels will automatically start to fill with data matching the time range query received since you created the panel. Results won't be available immediately, but within about 20 minutes, you'll see completed graphs and maps.
