:::note
If you're using a username and password with OpenTelemetry Collector version â‰¥ 0.104, we recommend using the downloaded config with an environment variable, for example: `${environment_variable}`.

On Linux, click **Download Environment Variables File** to get a file that includes the password, which should be set as an environment variable.
