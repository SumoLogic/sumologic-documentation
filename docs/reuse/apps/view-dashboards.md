All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard. Use these filters to drill down and examine the data to a granular level.
- You can change the time range for a dashboard or panel by selecting a predefined interval from a drop-down list, choosing a recently used time range, or specifying custom dates and times. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/set-custom-time-ranges/).
- You can use template variables to drill down and examine the data on a granular level. For more information, see [Filtering Dashboards with Template Variables](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables/).
- Most Next-Gen apps allow you to provide the **scope** at the installation time and are comprised of a key (`_sourceCategory` by default) and a default value for this key. Based on your input, the app dashboards will be parameterized with a dashboard variable, allowing you to change the dataset queried by all panels. This eliminates the need to create multiple copies of the same dashboard with different queries.
