To install the app:

1. In the **Search Apps** field, search for and then select your app.
1. Optionally, you can scroll down to preview the dashboards included with the app. Then, click **Install App** (sometimes this button says **Add Integration**).
1. Click **Next**.
1. Look for the dialog confirming that your app was installed successfully.<br/><img src="/img/get-started/library/app-success-sumo-apps.png" alt="app-success-sumo-apps.png" style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} width="80%" />

Once an app is installed, it will appear in your **Personal** folder or the folder that you specified. From here, you can share it with other users in your organization. Dashboard panels will automatically start to fill with data matching the time range query received since you created the panel. Results won't be available immediately, but within about 20 minutes, you'll see completed graphs and maps.
