**Proxy Options**. Select whether to use a proxy. (Applies only if the automation engine uses a bridge instead of cloud execution.)
   * **Use no proxy**. Communication runs on the bridge and does not use a proxy.
   * **Use default proxy**. Use the default proxy for the bridge set up as described in [Using a proxy](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-bridge/#using-a-proxy).
   * **Use different proxy**. Use your own proxy service. Provide the proxy URL and port number.
