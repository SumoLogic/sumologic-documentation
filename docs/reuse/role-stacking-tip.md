As a rule, you should avoid "role stacking" and provide all the access needed for a user in a single role. That is because when roles are stacked, conflicts can arise between the access provided by different roles. However, if you do "stack roles", we recommend that you use filtering to allow access rather than deny access. This way, each additional role allows more access, and conflicts are avoided that could arise from combining "allow access" and "deny access" filters from different roles.
