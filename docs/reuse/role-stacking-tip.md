As a best practice, avoid "role stacking" and assign all necessary access within a single role to prevent conflicts. When multiple roles are applied, conflicting permissions can arise. However, if role stacking is necessary, use filtering to allow access rather than deny it. This way, each additional role expands access rather than creating conflicts between "allow" and "deny" filters from different roles.
