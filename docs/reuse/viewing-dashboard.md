All dashboards have a set of filters that you can apply to the entire dashboard. Use these filters to drill down and examine the data to a granular level. 

- You can change the time range for a dashboard or panel by selecting a predefined interval from a drop-down list, choosing a recently used time range, or specifying custom dates and times. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards-new/set-custom-time-ranges/).
- If required, [configure](/docs/dashboards-new/about/#auto-refresh) the refresh interval rate for a dashboard or panel by clicking the drop-down arrow next to the refresh icon.
- Click the funnel icon in the dashboard top menu bar to [filter dashboard with Template Variables](/docs/dashboards-new/filter-template-variables/).
