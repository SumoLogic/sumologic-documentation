Refer to [Getting Started](/docs/api/getting-started) for Sumo Logic API Authentication, Endpoints, and Security.

Our APIs are built with [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/). You can generate client libraries in several languages and explore automated testing.

To access our API documentation, navigate to the appropriate link based on your Sumo deployment. Deployment types differ based on geographic location and account creation date. If unsure, see [How to determine your endpoint](/docs/api/getting-started#which-endpoint-should-i-should-use).
