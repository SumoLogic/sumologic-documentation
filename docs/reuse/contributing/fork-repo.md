To create new doc, we recommend forking our repo, making changes in a new branch, and submitting a PR for review.

Feel free to reach out to the Docs Team to discuss. We're happy to work with you on the project and talk through rewriting content, changing flow, adding a new topic or section, and deprecating content.

1. Fork the [Sumo Docs repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation) locally. Remember to sync your fork and update branches as needed.

1. Review our [README](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation#readme) documentation guidelines.
1. Create a new branch from your forked repo using a name that best describes the work or references a GitHub issue number. For example, if you wanted to submit a PR to edit our Elasticsearch app doc, you'd write something like: `<your initials>-apps-elasticsearch`.
