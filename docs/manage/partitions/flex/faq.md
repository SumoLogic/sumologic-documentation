This page answers frequently asked questions about Flex pricing.

## What is Flex Pricing?

import FlexPricing from '../../../reuse/flex-pricing.md';

<FlexPricing/>

## Is Flex Pricing available to existing Cloud Flex customers?

No, Flex Pricing is not currently available for existing Cloud Flex customers. However, it will become available in the near future. Currently, Flex Pricing is the default plan for new customers signing up with Sumo Logic.

## How is Flex Pricing different from the other data tiers?

With Flex Pricing, there is no cost to ingest and index log data, and no requirement to manage storage on your own or rehydrate at a premium for log indexing. This removes the complexity of predetermining the type of analytics required before the data is in the system. You simply pay for analytics and insights, not data management.

## Can I restrict access to Flex data to select users?


Yes, you can use [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-based-access-control) to restrict access to partitions in Flex. Although you can’t use a role search filter to restrict access to a partition by name, you can filter by the metadata that forms the routing expression for a partition.

For example, if you want to strict access to a partition whose routing expression is:

```
_sourceCategory=staging/*
```

You can create a role with this role search filter:

```
!(_sourceCategory=staging/*)
```

Then, you assign that role to any user that shouldn’t have access to data in that partition.

## How can I get visibility into our Flex search costs?

## How can I optimize Flex data search costs?

Below are some ways to control the cost of running queries data in Flex:

* Logically apportion your data, depending on how you plan to query it, into multiple partitions, instead of creating a single large partition. Try to limit queries to a single partition as much as possible. Assume you have three different services sending logs to Sumo Logic. There a couple of approaches you can take:
    * **Create one partition per service**. All the logs for that service go there. This approach can be leveraged if each team owns a service, and they typically query the logs within their service to find issues.
    * **Create one partition per log type (debug, infra, and so on)**. This approach can be leveraged if, most of the time, the team searches one log type per query. For example, the team only queries debug logs, and typically queries other logs like Database logs and OS logs in separate queries. 
* Try to use a restrictive time range, instead of running a query with a very long time range.
* Use indexes with the metadata fields to narrow down the volume of data scanned. This in turn will help you to reduce the scan cost. For example, if you're querying data from the `k8s_host` source and it's being sent to multiple partitions, you can limit the scope of your search to the `abc` partition by using `_index=abc` for the selected time range.
    ```sql
    _index=abc AND _sourceCategory=k8s_host
    ```

Using keywords or other metadata in a query will not reduce the amount of data scanned. For example, the inclusion of a keyword and custom field in the scope of the query below does not reduce the amount of data that Sumo Logic will scan. Sumo Logic will scan all data in the partition named `ybase_partition`.

```sql
_index=ybase_partition (error and cluster=nxt)
```

The table below should give you a sense of how the number of partitions you use and the query time range affects the volume of data scanned.  

| Query Time Range | Number of Partitions Queried | Data Scanned |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|:-------------|
| 1 day            | 1                            | 2 TB         |
| 1/2 day          | 1                            | 1 TB         |
| 4 day            | 1                            | 8 TB         |
| 1 day            | 2                            | 4 TB         |
| 1/2 day          | 2                            | 2 TB         |
| 2 days           | 2                            | 8 TB         |

## What is an ideal size for a partition for Flex?

We recommend you configure partitions to have less than 5 TB per day flowing into them. This practice:

* Reduces the cost of each query.
* Accelerates queries, as less data has to be scanned.

## How can I optimize my query using default scope?

Default scope allows you to include or exclude the partitions in the search query, helping you to optimize the search cost. For example, if a query needs to run through 10 partitions, which consumes about 10 GB of search data, narrowing the search query using the default scope can improve the query performance and reduce scan cost. You can modify the default scope by selecting or deselecting the **Include this partition in default scope** checkbox when creating/updating your partition. Let's say that out of 10 partitions, you excluded two partitions. Now, when you run a query that does not have `_index` / `_view` term referenced in the query, the search will only consider the included partitions, reducing the amount of data scanned and lowering the cost.


When partitions are marked as included and `_index` or `_view` is not referenced in the query, all included partitions will be considered by default. Default scope is also useful when `AND` or `OR` conditions are used in the query with `_index`. For example, consider you have three partitions: Partition A (Excluded), Partition B (Included), and Partition C (Included). Below are some scenarios:

- When you run the query without referring to `_index`, for example `error | count`, only Partition B and Partition C will be considered for the query, as Partition A is excluded from the default scope. 
- When you run a query referring to an index term, for example `_index="Partition A"`, only Partition A will be considered for the query. 
- Similarly, when you refer to multiple index terms, for example `_index="Partition A" OR _index="Partition B"`, only Partition A and Partition B will be considered for the query. 
- However, when you run a query like `_index="Partition A" OR error`, all partitions (Partition A, Partition B, and Partition C) will be considered. This is because the `error` keyword might be present in Partition B or C as well, requiring a scan of all three partitions.

## How are preview queries charged?

While the current impact is extremely minimal, preview queries that you run during scenarios like monitor creation may incur repetitive but negligible charges.
