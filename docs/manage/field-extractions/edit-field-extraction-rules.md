To access the Field Extraction Rules page, in the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Field Extraction Rules**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Field Extraction Rules**. 
1. Find the rule in the table and click it. A window appears on the right of the table, click the **Edit** button.
