:::important
You need the **Manage field extraction rules** [role capability](../users-roles/roles/role-capabilities.md) to edit a field extraction rule. 
:::

Changes to Field Extraction Rules are implemented immediately. Additionally, you can save a copy of a rule and make edits to the new version of the rule without making any changes to the original rule.

1. In Sumo Logic, go to **Manage Data** > **Logs** > **Field Extraction Rules.**
1. Find the rule in the table and click it. A window appears on the right of the table, click the **Edit** button.
1. Make changes as needed and click **Save** when done.
