title: Create an Allowlist for IP or CIDR Addresses
description: Service Allowlist Settings let you explicitly grant access to specific IP or CIDR addresses.
---

Service Allowlist Settings allow you to explicitly grant access to specific IP addresses and/or CIDR notations for logins, APIs, and dashboard access.

Once the feature is enabled, the IP address or [CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) of each user in an account must be added to the allowlist in order to log in to Sumo Logic UI or make any requests via the Sumo Logic APIs. The allowlist does not cover the Collector IP (Server IP) to connect to Sumo Logic.

You can also share dashboards with users connecting from IP addresses or CIDRs in this allowlist. That way they can see the dashboard without logging in, but the dashboard remains private to your allowlist. The public cannot see it.

Allowlist settings take effect after users have logged out of their Sumo Logic accounts. If a user is logged in when you make the allow setting, they will stay logged in. Any IP or CIDR addresses must be associated with your company in order to add them to the allow. Wildcards are not supported; don't use them to specify an IP or CIDR address range.

:::note
The IP is generally your host IP address. But if your request is coming through a proxy, an x-forwarded-for header is included in the HTTP requests to Sumo Logic, which is used as the IP when evaluating the allowlist.
