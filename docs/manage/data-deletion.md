Data Deletion allows you to quickly and easily request the removal of ingested data from Sumo Logic. This is particularly useful for removing inadvertently ingested sensitive data.

You can independently and swiftly remove sensitive data, mitigating compliance issues and potential data exposure without needing to contact Sumo Logic support.

Key features:

- **User-friendly deletion**. Easily delete data.
- **Multiple datasets and time ranges**. Flexible data management.
- **Customizable filters**. Tailor deletion to your needs.
- **Robust auditing mechanisms**. Ensure thorough tracking.

## Create a Data Deletion Request

:::warning
Deletion requests result in the permanent deletion of data. Once deleted, the data cannot be recovered. Ensure that you have appropriately backed up any necessary data before submitting a deletion request.

## Limitations

### Handling future ingestion of sensitive data

Customers must manage the future ingestion of sensitive data using [Processing Rules](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules). Deletion requests will only apply to data that has already been indexed, not to data that will be ingested in the future.

### Deletion scope

Deletion is restricted to partitions and the default view (sumologic_default) in Sumo Logic. Deletion is currently not supported for other view types, such as [Scheduled Views](/docs/manage/scheduled-views) or ad hoc views created using the save view operator. Sensitive data may still be present in these unsupported views.

### Deletion request limit

Each deletion request is limited to 100,000 messages. This means that any deletion operation can only target up to 100,000 messages at a time.
