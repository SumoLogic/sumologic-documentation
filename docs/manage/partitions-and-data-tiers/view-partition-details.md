    :::note
    The information displayed for partitions that contain CSE Records varies from other partitions. You can tell if a partition contains CSE Records from its name: The names of the Sumo Logic partitions that contain CSE Records begin with the string `sec_record_`.  The detailed view for security partitions does not display Data Tier or a routing expression. Note also that you can’t edit a security partition, or configure data forwarding for it. CSE users can search security partitions, as described in [Searching for CSE Records in Sumo Logic] (../../Cloud_SIEM_Enterprise/Records,_Signals,_Entities,_and_Insights/15Searching_for_CSE_Records_in_Sumo_Logic.md "Searching for CSE Records in Sumo Logic").
