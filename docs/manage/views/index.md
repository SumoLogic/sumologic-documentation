Views allows you to track all user created indexes and system created indexes which thereby helps you to configure data forwarding, retention period, and data tier for these indexes. Views speed the process for small and historical subsets of your data by functioning as a pre-aggregated/pre-compute index. 

* Visibility of all indexes will be based on admin created roles/permissions.
* As a user you will be able to delete or decommission the user created indexes.
* As a user you will be able to see the schema of each view and see the views in search autocomplete to which you have the access.
* As a user you can save only the query and reuse it later by using `| save as <view name>` at the end of query.
* As a admin you will be able to view the existing system limits for each type and amount of consumed quota. 
* Only admin can define the access control on these indexes.
* Scheduled searches only with **Save to Index** alert type will be visible in Views.
