Previously, monitors and alert response page (ARP) were only supported in Sumo Logicâ€™s Continuous data tier. Now, you can set robust and configurable alerting policies that enable you to get notified about critical changes and view granular details about an individual alert that include data from the Infrequent tier.

## Monitors

Monitors track your Metrics, Logs, or SLO data in real time and send notifications when noteworthy changes happen in your production applications. To create Monitors, you can refer to the [Create a Monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor/).

## Alert Response Page

The Alert Response page is where you can view granular details about an individual alert. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-response/#alert-page).
