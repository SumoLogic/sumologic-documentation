These topics have information about creating and managing Sumo Logic roles and users. In Sumo Logic,  an administrator controls access to capabilities and data by assigning capabilities and search filters to roles, and then assigning user to roles. For more information, see [Role-Based Access Control](roles/role-based-access-control.md).

In Sumo Logic, you'll find pages for managing users and roles at **Administration** > **Users and Roles**.

To manage users and roles, you must have the Administrator role or your role must have been assigned the [manage users and roles capability](roles/role-capabilities.md).
