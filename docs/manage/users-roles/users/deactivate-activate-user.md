To temporarily prevent a user from logging into the Sumo Logic service, you can change the user's status to Inactive. You can reactivate an inactive user at any time without the need to re-enter user details.

:::note
If you want to permanently remove a user, [you can delete them](delete-user.md). However, before you delete a user, make sure to perform the steps in [Offboard a User](offboard-user.md).
