This guide has information about creating and managing Sumo Logic roles. In Sumo Logic, an administrator controls access to capabilities and data by assigning capabilities and search filters to roles, and then assigning user to roles. For more information see [Role-Based Access Control](role-based-access-control.md).

:::note
To manage users and roles, you must have the administrator role or your role must have been assigned the [manage users and roles capability](role-capabilities.md).
:::

In Sumo Logic, you'll find pages for managing roles at **Administration \> Users and Roles \> Roles**.
