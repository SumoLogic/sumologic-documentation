# Edit a Source

From the **Manage Collection** page, you can edit some characteristics of a Source, including its name, description, Collection time, Source Host, Source Category, Advanced options, and Processing Rules.

:::important
Changes to metadata are applied to messages going forward from this point in time, and aren't applied retroactively.
:::

If [local file configuration management] (../../03Send-Data/Sources/03Use-JSON-to-Configure-Sources/Local-Configuration-File-Management.md) is enabled for the Collector, Source editing is disabled.

To edit a Source:

1. In Sumo Logic, select **Manage Data \> Collection \> Collection**.
1. Click the **Source** name, or click the **Edit** link to the right of the Source name.
1. Change the name or change the metadata fields as needed. For details on configuration options, refer to your source type in [Sources] (../../03Send-Data/Sources.md).
1. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
