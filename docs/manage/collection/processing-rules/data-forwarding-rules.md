# Data Forwarding Rules

A data forwarding rule specifies how data is forwarded from an Installed Collector Source to non-Sumo Logic destinations, so that data is made available immediately to all the systems that need to consume it. Data forwarding rules are processed after all other processing rules.

For instructions on how to use the Sumo web app to configure data forwarding rules, see [Forward Data from an Installed Collector] (../../Data-Forwarding/Configure-Data-Forwarding-for-Installed-Collectors.md).

For instructions on how to configure data forwarding rules using JSON, see [Creating Processing Rules Using a JSON File] (../../../03Send-Data/Sources/03Use-JSON-to-Configure-Sources.md).
