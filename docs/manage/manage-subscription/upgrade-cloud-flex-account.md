## Upgrade options for Cloud Flex accounts

This table summarizes upgrade options for different Cloud Flex account types.

| Account Type | Upgrade Options |
| :-- | :-- |
| Free or Trial  | - Professional <br/>- Enterprise—Log ingest is capped at 20GB/day. |
| Professional | - You can increase or decrease the supported product variables while staying a Professional account.<br/>- Enterprise—Log ingest is capped at 20GB/day. |
| Enterprise | - You can increase or decrease the supported product variables; log ingest is capped at 20GB/day. |

## Who can upgrade my organization's account? 

It depends on your current account type:

* If your organization currently has a Sumo Logic Free account, any admin can perform the upgrade. That admin is then known as the Account Owner, meaning that he or she is the only person in the account that can view and change the credit card information. 
* If your organization already has a Sumo Logic Professional account, only the existing Account Owner can perform upgrades.
* Sumo Logic Enterprise accounts do not have account owners, as all upgrades are handled by a Sumo Logic salesperson.
