This topic covers how to delete your organization from a Sumo Logic Free or Trial account and permanently close the account. It also provides instructions for cancelling a Sumo Logic licensed account. 

## Close a Sumo Logic Free or Trial account

The owner of a Sumo Logic Free or Trial account can delete their organization from Sumo Logic, which will close the account permanently. When you delete your organization, you delete all users and data from Sumo Logic, close the account, and log yourself out as a user.

## Internal Only Information

Deleting the data from an account is two-step process:

1. **Mark the data to be deleted.** Once marked, the data cannot be searched. Data is marked to be deleted within one hour after the Org is disabled.
1. **Physically delete the data.** There is no hard guarantee for this, but StorageGC does not lag by more than few hours.
