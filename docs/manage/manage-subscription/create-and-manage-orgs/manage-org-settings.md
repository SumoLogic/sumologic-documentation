## Set up a custom subdomain

This section has instructions for setting up a custom subdomain for the URL you use to access Sumo Logic.

By default, your Sumo Logic account has a "service" subdomain. For example, `service.sumologic.com`.

If you have multiple Sumo Logic accounts, you may find it useful to configure a custom subdomain for each of your Sumo Logic accounts.

Custom subdomains can help ensure that requests are authenticated to the right account when links are received. Once configured by your account owner, your custom subdomain will be used in the links Sumo generates when you share queries or dashboards, or the links in alerts and other emails you may receive from your account. These subdomain-enabled links will direct the user to the specified account for authentication.

When you use custom subdomains in combination with SAML integrations [configured with SP initiated login](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml), your SAML authentication options will be provided within your subdomain-enabled Sumo Logic login page.

:::note
* While subdomains are the preferred method to provide access to multiple accounts, you can also use [multi-account access](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/multi-account-access/).
* Custom subdomains are not currently available for Sumo Logic accounts created through third-party integrations that require authentication using those integrations, such as Heroku and Jfrog.
:::

### Key considerations

Before changing your account subdomain, consider the following:  

* You are responsible for the subdomain name, including ensuring that use of the  subdomain doesn’t violate the intellectual property rights of another party. Sumo Logic recommends that you use your corporate domain name, or a variation of it, as your Sumo Logic account subdomain.
* Sumo Logic reserves the right to deactivate, change, or require you to change your account subdomain. 
* Shared URLs that contain a custom subdomain may no longer work after you change the subdomain. You’ll need to either manually edit the subdomain portion of out-of-date URLs or re-share the content after changing a subdomain name.  
* When you set up a subdomain for the first time, the pre-existing URLS for accessing Sumo Logic will continue to work; however, users will be asked to authenticate via the default service domain. We suggest updating any saved/stored links with the new subdomain to prevent this issue. 
* Once you update your subdomain to a new value, the previous subdomain will become immediately free for use by another account.
* After you update your subdomain, Sumo Logic users must re-authenticate using the new subdomain. Sumo Logic suggests you notify your users prior to changing your account subdomain. 
* Subdomain must be unique across ALL accounts and deployments. You cannot use a subdomain name that is already in use, even if the accounts reside in different deployment regions. If you try to change an account subdomain to a value that is already in use, you’ll be prompted to supply a different name.

### Change account subdomain 

:::note
You must be the account owner of the Sumo Logic account to change the account subdomain.
:::

1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic). In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Administration > Account > Account Overview**. <br/> [**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). In the top menu select **Administration**, and then under **Account** select **Account Overview**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Account Overview**.
1. Select the details icon at the top.
1. Access the appropriate menu for your [account type](#availability):
     * Cloud Flex Credits: From the gear icon menu at the top, select **Change Account Subdomain**.
     * Cloud Flex: At the top, select **Manage Organization > Change Account Owner**.
1. Enter a new subdomain name. The name must be between 4 and 63 characters in length at least four characters in length, and can contain lower case letters, numbers, and dashes only. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/change-subdomain-name.png')} style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} alt="change-subdomain-name.png" width="700" />
1. Click **Change Subdomain** Name to update the name.
1. You will be automatically logged out and redirected to the new subdomain login page. 

## SSO for child organizations

When you create a new child organization, a subdomain is automatically created and single sign-on (SSO) is enabled, allowing you to sign in to the child organization without having to provide separate credentials. To use this feature you do not have to set up SAML for single sign-on for the child organization. 

If you choose not to use this SSO feature, click [Disable SSO](#disable-sso) on the child organizations. Then users log in with username and password, or you can manually [set up SAML for single sign-on](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/) on the child organizations.

### Role assignment

By default, the `Administrator` role is used for on-demand user provisioning in child organizations. So when a user from a parent organization signs in to a child organization using the SSO option, they are provisioned with `Administrator` access. If you want to use another role such as `Analyst` instead of `Administrator` for users logging in to child organizations, you can edit the SAML configuration on child organizations and specify the `Analyst` role in on-demand roles provisioning. See [Configure on-demand roles provisioning](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#configure-on-demand-roles-provisioning).

If you have configured roles within your child organizations that match the roles within your parent, you can configure the SAML configuration to enable [on-demand role provisioning](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#configure-on-demand-roles-provisioning).

### Sign in to a child organization automatically

When you open the details of a child organization, a link to the child organization appears under **Basic Details**. When you click the link, you are automatically signed in to the child organization.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/mssp-sso-enabled.png')} alt="SSO enabled for a child organization" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>

Automatic sign-in works because when the child organization was created, a [subdomain](#set-up-a-customsubdomain) was automatically added, and SSO was enabled by default. As a result, when you click the link to the child organization, you are provisioned as a user in the child organization and can access it at any time without needing to log in.

:::tip
If you want to change the automatically-generated subdomain name to a preferred domain name, you can sign in to the child organization as an administrator and [change the subdomain](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-and-manage-orgs/manage-org-settings/#change-account-subdomain).
:::

### Sign back in with parent organization credentials

As an administrator, if you log out of a child organization with SSO enabled, the following screen appears. Click **Login with Parent Org** to sign back in automatically using your parent organization credentials.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/mssp-login-with-parent-org.png')} alt="Login with Parent Org button" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="300"/>

### Enabling or disabling SSO

Although anyone with the View Organizations role capability can access child organizations, only users with the [Manage Organizations role capability](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#organizations) can enable or disable the SSO option.

#### Enable SSO

If a [subdomain](#set-up-a-customsubdomain) exists, but SSO is disabled for the child organization, click **Enable SSO**:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/enable-sso-button.png')} alt="Enable SSO button" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="250"/>

If there is no subdomain defined for a child organization, hovering your mouse over the **Enable SSO** button displays the message **Set up custom subdomain before enabling SSO**:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/no-subdomain-defined.png')} alt="No subdomain defined" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="300"/>

To set up a custom subdomain for the child organization, see [Set up a custom subdomain](#set-up-a-customsubdomain) above. Once you set up the subdomain, the subdomain's URL will appear and the **Enable SSO** button will be clickable.

#### Disable SSO

When a child organization has SSO enabled, the child organization's details display the subdomain URL in the **Subdomain** field, and the **SSO** field says **Enabled**:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/manage/subscriptions/subdomain-and-sso-enabled.png')} alt="SSO enabled for a child organization" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="250"/>

If you want to require administrators to enter credentials to sign in to the child organization, click **Disable SSO** to turn off single sign-on.
