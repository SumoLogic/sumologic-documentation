Sumo Logic provides flexible account types within its Flex packaging for any size organization with a credit-based capacity measurement. A *credit* is a unit of measure that tracks use, whether data ingested (GB), storage, or metrics, throughout a contract period. Credits can be used as needed for your desired purpose. This allows you to carefully manage your account.

This page provides information on the Flex Credits account types you can choose, and then explains how to monitor and manage your account.

## Account types​

You can select from Free, Trial, or Enterprise Suite Flex accounts.

* **Free** accounts give you access to most Sumo Logic features, with a credit allocation of 1.25 credits a day. Credits can be used for logs, metrics, and traces, in any combination that meets your needs. The retention period for logs is 7 days. Free accounts allow three users.
   :::note
   [Data Management](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#data-management), which you can find under **Administration** > **Account**, is not available for Free accounts (Trial and paid accounts only).
   :::
* **Trial** accounts allow you to try all of Sumo Logic's advanced features to understand how Sumo Logic will fit within your organization before you buy. It includes a credit allocation to support a daily data volume limit of 1 GB per day providing approximately 500GB of search data volume daily or 15TB of search volume, 20 users, and 30 days of data retention. If you use up the credits allocated for the trial period before the period ends, Sumo Logic’s [standard throttling mechanism](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/log-ingestion) will be applied to your log ingest. For information on Trial account features, see [Cloud Flex Legacy accounts](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/cloud-flex-legacy-accounts).
   :::note
   Trials are limited to 30 days. If you need to extend your trial period, contact our sales team to inquire about a Proof of Concept (PoC).
   :::
* **Enterprise Suite Flex** accounts are optimized to address the most advanced data insight challenges. Enterprise Suite accounts include all of Sumo Logic’s industry-leading capabilities.
   :::note
   [Ingest Budgets](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/ingest-budgets) are only available for Enterprise Suite Flex accounts. Ingest budgets control the capacity of daily log ingestion volume sent to Sumo Logic from collectors. For tips on how to monitor and limit the data you're sending to Sumo Logic, see [Log Ingestion](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/log-ingestion/).

## Account Page​

The **Account Overview** tab of the **Account** page displays information about your Sumo Logic organization, account type, contract and billing periods, number of credits you've used, as well as live dashboards and real time alerts. The account owner can reassign the Account Owner role from this page.

:::note permissions required
To view the **Account Overview** tab, you must have a role that grants you the [View Account Overview](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#data-management) capability.
:::

The Account page provides an at-a-glance view of your account information in the following panels.

### Top left panel ​

* **Organization**. Displays the name of your Sumo Logic organization, and its hexadecimal organization ID number. This helps Sumo identify your account.
* **Plan Type**. Displays your account type for your Sumo Logic subscription such as Trial or Enterprise Suite Flex.
* **Contract Period**. Displays the start and end dates of your contract period.
* **Live Dashboard Panels and Real Time Alerts Count**. A count of all real-time activity in your account.

### Total Credit Usage ​

* **Credits Used**. Displays the number of credits used and the percentage used since the beginning of your current contract.
* **Credits remaining**. Displays number of credits remaining as well as the percentage of credits used since the beginning of your current contract.
* **Total Credits Usage Breakdown.** Displays the total consumed contract credits and promotional credits of your current contract.

### Usage Forecast​

The usage forecast gives you an opportunity to see the potential end of the current credits and an estimate on when those credits will end.

* **Upgrade Plan**. Link to the upgrade account page, where you can message your request for an account upgrade to your account manager.
* **Forecasted use**. Predicts your credit usage by end of the contract period.
* **Credits exhaust**. The predicted number of days and the exact date when we estimate your current credits will be exhausted.
* **Dynamic forecast**. You can now see predicted credit usage based on the past trends for 7, 30, or 90 days that can be selected from the dropdown.

### Usage Details by Category​

* **Usage Details**. Shows graphs that represent detail usage of Sumo Credits by ingest, storage, or any type of data service utilized from the start of the contract period.
* **Usage Categories**. Table displaying the credits used, % of credits used, and units by usage categories, ingest type and promotional credits usage.
* **Usage % Change**. Indicates the difference in credit usage for a selected usage category over time. For example, if you choose the date from Jan 1 to Jan 7, it will show the usage difference between Dec 25 to Dec 31 and Jan 1 to Jan 7 for each usage category.

### Promotional Credits​

There are times when Sumo Logic promotes services and consumables through the provision of Promotional Credits. Promotional Credits are non-transferrable and auto-expire at the end of the promotion period. In other words, if the Promotional Credits are not used within the promotion period, they do not carry over. They are of a "use it or lose it" nature. Promotional Credits are specific to a promotion and cannot be used for any service. The criteria, including promotion period, are listed in your contract. Promotional Credit consumption is calculated separately from the credits you paid for in your contract period. Promotional Credits are utilized as the priority credit for the specified credit variable.

For example, if your contract period is licensed for 100,000 credits and 10,000 promotional credits for "Metrics” and you're using all your credits for metrics, Promotional Credits will be the first 10,000 credits used. Once the Promotional Credits are depleted, paid credits will be used for metrics. The ability to filter down to the focused credit component and see more detailed patterns extends to Promotional Credits as well as paid credits. For more information, see [Monitoring Promotional Credit Usage](#monitoring-promotional-credit-usage).

* **Promotional Credits** bar graphs show the rate at which you are consuming your allocated Promotional Credits.

### Viewing your account information​

To view your Account page, go to the left navigation bar and then select **Administration** > **Account**. The **Account Overview** tab is shown by default.

:::note permissions required

## Monitoring account usage ​

The Usage (Sumo Credits) panel at the bottom of the Account Overview page provides at-a-glance analytics with which you can intuitively monitor your account usage in comparison to your contract capacity. In the **Usage** panel, you can do the following:

* Review your usage to date.
* Review usage forecast based on usage to date.
* View data usage comparisons for data tiers.
* View data comparisons for total storage or metrics.
* Drill into a selected time interval for a more granular view of usage data.
* Monitor Promotional Credit usage.

### Usage categories​

The Usage Details panel contains the following usage categories:

* **Flex Scan Upfront**. Used for reserved log search volume.
* **Flex Scan Metered**. Used for log search volume when not Upfront search volume is available.
* **Flex Storage**. Credits used for log storage.
* **Tracing Ingest**. Credits used for tracing.
* **Cloud SIEM Ingest**. Credits used for logs ingested into Cloud SIEM.
* **Metrics Ingest**. Credits used for metrics ingested.
* **Promotional categories**. See [Monitoring Promotional Credit usage](#monitoring-promotional-credit-usage).

:::note
The usage data on this page is updated frequently to reflect the near-real time status of your account. However, please note that storage is calculated based on the total daily storage volume and reported on the next day. It may take some time before the storage usage for the previous day is fully displayed on the UI.
:::

### Changing views and time intervals​

The Sumo Logic **Account** page allows you to easily monitor your data usage over selected time intervals, including total storage and metrics usage.

To switch between views and time interval displays:

1. Log in to Sumo Logic and select **Administration** > **Account** in the left navigation pane. The Account page appears with the **Account Overview** tab shown by default. From this tab, you can see your subscription type, current credit usage, and forecasted usage as well as drill down by data tier or promotional credit type.
1. To only view data for a specific analytic type or types, go to the bottom of the **Usage Details** panel and click the check box next to the analytic type or types you want to exclude.<br/> ![account-details-credit-usage-flex.png](/img/account/account-details-credit-usage-flex.png)
1. To toggle an analytic data type back on, click the blank icon next to the data type name. The analytic data type reappears in the graph and the credit usage for the data type is once again included.
1. To change the aggregation of the data, click the Group by arrow and choose day, week, or month from the dropdown list. The default is **View By Day**.

### Drilling into usage data​

You can easily drill into usage graph for a more granular view of the data, with the added ability of scrolling through the display with a swipe of your cursor.

To drill into usage data, do the following:

1. In the **Usage Details** panel, drag your cursor over the graph intervals you want to analyze in greater detail.
1. To scroll through the data, click the Zoom (magnifying glass) icon to toggle On the Pan feature, then select the background and drag your cursor to the left and right. Optionally, you can hover the cursor over an area on the chart to view a pop-up with detailed information.

### Monitoring Promotional Credit usage​

You can filter for a focused credit component to assess your Promotional Credit usage, in the same way you [drill into usage data](#drilling-into-usage-data) for paid credits.

To monitor your Promotional Credit usage:
1. In the Details Credits Usage panel, deselect all Usage Categories. Only Promotional credits will remain.
1. To only view data for a specific analytic type, de-select individual options under Promotional Credits such as Continuous Ingest, Storage, or Infrequent Ingest to see those options removed from the Credits used chart.
