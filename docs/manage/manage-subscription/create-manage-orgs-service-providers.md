This topic has information about Sumo Logic’s Organizations (“Sumo Orgs”) feature for Sumo Logic Service Providers. Sumo Orgs allows you to logically group, provision, and centrally manage and monitor the credits usage of multiple orgs. We use the term *parent org* to refer to the org from which you create and manage orgs, and *child orgs* to refer to the orgs you create. 

As a Service Provider, you can create two types of child orgs:

* You can create POV (Proof of Value) Trial orgs for your prospects to access in order to evaluate Sumo Logic. For more information, see [About POV Trial orgs](#about-pov-trial-orgs).
* You can create child orgs, either for use within your own company or for customers who are not going to trial Sumo Logic before subscribing.

In either case, the child orgs you create will be the same plan type as the parent org. For example, if you have an Enterprise Suite plan, the child orgs you create will also be Enterprise Suite accounts. 

When you create a child org, you provision it with credits, based on the ingest volume you estimate for the org. We refer to the different flavors of ingest—Continuous Log Ingest, Frequent Log Ingest, and so on—as *product variables*. When you provision a child org you use a Credits Calculator to estimate and allocate required credits for each product variable.

We refer to your estimates of ingest capacity required for each product variable as *baselines*. Sumo Logic’s throttling multipliers for logs and metrics are based on these estimates. (For example, if you estimate 1GB usage for logs and specify that as the "baseline" when you create the org, Sumo Logic will start [throttling](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/log-ingestion.md) when ingestion to the org reaches 4 to 10 times the baseline. The multiplier depends on your account size.)

Users that have the required role capabilities can create child orgs under a parent org, and manage and monitor the allocation and consumption of Sumo Logic credits across orgs, and for each child org. This functionality is available in the Sumo Logic UI in the **Organizations** tab and also in the [Organizations Management API](https://organizations.sumologic.com/docs/).

## About Cloud SIEM provisioning

You can enable and provision Cloud SIEM for a child org. Note that the process of provisioning Cloud SIEM can take up to 24 hours. For more information, see [Monitor Cloud SIEM Provisioning](#monitor-cloud-siem-provisioning), below.

## Requirements for creating and managing orgs

There are several role capabilities that are required to work with orgs:

* **View Organizations**. This capability is required to view the Organizations UI.
* **Create Organizations**. This capability is required to create or provision child organizations.
* **Change Credits Allocation**. This capability is required to change the credits allocation and baselines for a child organization. 
* **Create Trial Organizations**. This capability is required to create and provision trial organizations. 
* **Upgrade Trial Organizations**. This capability is required to upgrade POV Trial organizations. 
* **Upgrade Trial Organizations**. This capability is required to deactivate POV Trial organizations. 

## About POV Trial orgs

POV Trial orgs you create will have a 45 day trial period. POV Trial orgs will be provisioned with the following ingestion limits.

* 5 GB Continuous Tier ingest
* 5 GB Frequent Tier ingest
* 5 GB Infrequent Tier ingest
* 5,000 metric data points per minute (DPM) 
* 5 GB traces ingestion
* 5 GB Cloud SIEM ingest

:::note
The credits associated with the trial org allocations don’t impact the parent org’s credits allocation.
:::

You can upgrade a trial org by editing the org and changing the Plan Type. When you upgrade a POV Trial org, if the org is in a different Sumo Logic deployment from the parent org, the Credits calculator may add a deployment factor, which is a percentage upcharge that varies by deployment.

The plan gets downgraded to [**Free** plan with limitations](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/sumo-logic-credits-accounts/#credits---account-types) once the 45-day POV trial period is over. To prevent this from happening, Sumo Logic provides indicators about the expiration date in two different places on the platform.

* **View details for the selected organizations**. You can see the **Plan Expiry** date with information about the downgrading of your plan in the view details side panel for the selected organizations. This tooltip is different for CSV and Non-CSV provisioned child org.
* **Child org table**. If the number of days left for expiry is less than 14, a warning icon with the expiry date will be shown against the respective organizations, and the information about downgrading your plan will turn into a warning with the same message.

:::info
If your CSE POV trial plan is downgraded to the free plan, your CSE access will be disabled and your data will be erased after seven days.

## Update an org's credits allocation

:::info
If the org has already depleted its credits, you can see a red color warning icon in the **Usage %** column and a red-colored usage bar in the **Allocation & usage** section when you view the selected org.
:::

To change an org's credits allocation:
1.  <!--Kanso [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). Kanso--> In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Administration > Organizations**. <!--Kanso <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-new/). In the top menu select **Administration**, and then under **Account** select **Organizations**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Organizations**. Kanso-->
1. Click the row for the org you want to edit.
1. Click **Edit** in the right hand pane. <br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/subscriptions/edit-org-3.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="your description" width="450" />
1. Under **Modify Credit Allocation**, you can increase or decrease the credits based on your requirement.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/subscriptions/modify-allocation-button.png')} style={{border:'1px solid grey'}} alt="allocation" width="450" />
      :::note
      Ensure your total new allocation is not less than the consumed credits.
      :::
      You can select **Credits to be Added** and enter either the recommended credit value or a value of your choice to top-up additional credits and avoid credit depletion. This recommendation is calculated based on the usage forecast and the average daily credit usage for the selected contract period.
      
      **Example 1**: Consider that you are heading towards credit depletion and need to add more credits. The below image shows you have almost run out of the credits (1840/1841) allocated to the child org. To increase the credits to the child org, select **Credits to be Added**. An info icon will appear below with a suggestion on how many credits can be added to this child org based on the usage forecast. So, in this case, it is suggested that you add 135 credits.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/subscriptions/modify-allocation-recommendation.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="modify-allocation-recommendation" width="450" />
      <br/>Click **View Details** to view the detailed breakdown of the recommended value.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/subscriptions/modify-allocation-usage-forecast.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="modify-allocation-usage-forecast" width="450" />
      
      **Example 2**: Consider you need to increase credits to your child org. The below image shows that you have used 35 credits out of 31026 credits allocated to your child org. Now, if you wish to increase the credits to your child org, select **Credits to be Added** and add the additional credits required.<br/> <img src={useBaseUrl('img/subscriptions/modify-allocation-recommendatio-example-2.png')} style={{border:'1px solid gray'}} alt="modify-allocation-recommendatio-example-2" width="450" />
