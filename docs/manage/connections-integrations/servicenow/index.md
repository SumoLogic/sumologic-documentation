description: With the ServiceNow integration, search results from Sumo Logic can be uploaded to your organization's ServiceNow account.

Your organization can use collected data to investigate issues across your deployment.

Data is uploaded to ServiceNow via the use of scheduled searches. After saving a search, results are available in ServiceNow. Additionally, you can launch ad-hoc ServiceNow investigations using search results in Sumo Logic.
