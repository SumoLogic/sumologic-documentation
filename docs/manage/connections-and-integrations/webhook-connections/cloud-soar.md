[Cloud SOAR](https://www.sumologic.com/solutions/cloud-soar/) can receive alerts from Sumo Logic Monitors and Scheduled Searches to create Incidents. First, you'll need to create a Cloud SOAR connection. Then you can use the connection as the Connection Type in a [Monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors) or the Alert Type in a [Scheduled Search](schedule-searches-webhook-connections.md).

You need to have [Cloud SOAR](https://www.sumologic.com/solutions/cloud-soar/) enabled on your account for this connection to be available.

:::note
You need the **Manage connections** [role capability](../../users-and-roles/roles/role-capabilities.md) to create webhook connections.

This section demonstrates how to create a webhook connection from Sumo Logic to Cloud SOAR.

1. In Sumo Logic, go to **Manage Data \> Monitoring \> Connections**.
1. Click **+ Add** and choose **Cloud SOAR** as the connection type.

1. Enter a **Name** and give an optional **Description** to the connection.
1. The **URL** and **Authorization Header** are automatically defined by Sumo Logic. You should not edit these.
1. The **Templates** dropdown shows a list of all incident templates, by name, configured in your Cloud SOAR environment.
1. The default **Payload** synchronizes with the selected template and the associated `template_id` field is automatically defined in the default payload. A `template_id` is required in the payload in order to configure the connection. For details on variables you can use as parameters within your JSON object, see [Webhook Payload Variables](set-up-webhook-connections.md).
1. Click **Save**.
