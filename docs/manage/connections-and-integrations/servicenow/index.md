Your organization can use collected data to investigate issues across your deployment.

Data is uploaded to ServiceNow via the use of scheduled searches. After saving a search, results are available in ServiceNow. Additionally, you can launch ad-hoc ServiceNow investigations using search results in Sumo Logic.
