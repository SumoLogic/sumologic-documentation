description: Data Forwarding allows you to forward selected data to an external server or Amazon S3.
---


Data Forwarding is not currently supported for data in the [Infrequent Tier](../partitions-data-tiers/data-tiers.md).

Data Forwarding allows you to forward log data to an external server or supported storage service. There are two different types of data forwarding: 

* An [Installed Collector](docs/send-data/installed-collectors) can forward raw log data to an external destination at ingest time using the following protocols:
    * Syslog (TCP and UDP)
    * Generic REST API
    * Hitachi Data Systems HTTP REST API

    :::note
    [Archive](../archive.md) allows you to forward log data from [Installed Collectors](docs/send-data/installed-collectors) to AWS S3 buckets to collect at a later time.
    :::

* [Partitions](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers) or [Scheduled Views](/docs/manage/scheduled-views) can forward log data to an AWS S3 bucket. See [Forwarding Data from Sumo Logic to S3](amazon-s3-bucket.md) for details.
