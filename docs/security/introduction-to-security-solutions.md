Sumo Logic supports the entire spectrum of security use cases, from security monitoring and analytics, to security incident and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR):

* Cloud Security Analytics

   Provides cloud security monitoring to detect and respond to threats in real-time. Built natively in the cloud, the dynamic scaling platform makes it fast to gain deep security insights with pre-built applications that include out-of-the-box dashboards, queries, and full coverage for your entire cloud infrastructure.

* Cloud SIEM

   Gives analysts prioritized and contextualized actionable threats with automated security workflows. This removes common technology limitations that burden a security operations center (SOC) teamâ€™s efficiency and ability to mitigate risk. Out-of-the-box automated detection reduces manual work, saving valuable resource time and enabling your team to be more effective by allowing them to focus on higher-value security functions.

* Cloud SOAR

   Fully automates triage, investigation, and resolution of threats. The open integrations framework allows you to connect to a multitude of third-party applications. The platform provides full incident response lifecycle management with machine learning and threat hunting, significantly accelerating mean time to respond (MTTR).
