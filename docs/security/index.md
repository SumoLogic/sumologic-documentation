Out-of-the-box automated detection reduces manual work, saving valuable resource time and enabling your team to be more effective by allowing them to focus on higher-value security functions. | Fully automates triage, investigation, and resolution of threats **for any security professional**. The open integrations framework allows you to connect to a multitude of third-party applications. The platform provides full incident response lifecycle management with machine learning and threat hunting, accelerating mean time to respond (MTTR). |
