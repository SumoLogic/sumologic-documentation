Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS provides a unified view of risks, misconfigurations, and active threats in your AWS infrastructure spanning multiple AWS accounts and regions. The solution leverages native AWS tools and telemetry to accelerate cloud security outcomes.

Key features of the solution include:
* **Risk overview**. See a summary of all resources that pose risks, and get an action plan for addressing the most important areas of concern.
* **Active threats**. See threats in resources and AWS API calls.
* **Security control failures**. See misconfigurations  in your environment that may leave you vulnerable to attackers.
* **Suspicious activity**. See activity identified by anomaly detection across users, web interactions, networks, and Identity Access Management (IAM).

Entities presented in the dashboards are normalized from log sources into [AWS Elastic Common Schema (ECS)](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/master/ecs-reference.html), to provide seamless pivots between dashboards during threat investigations.

Use Sumo Logic’s [monitoring](/docs/alerts/monitors/) to receive alerts from the solution. To see monitors for the solution, go to the [**Monitors**](/docs/alerts/monitors/settings/) page and open the **Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS** folder.

:::note
* After initial installation, data collection may be delayed.
* If you have already installed the [Amazon Security Quickstart](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/security-quickstart/), collectors may be duplicated to collect from the same sources. To prevent this, use the existing source category for collection.

## Collecting logs for Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS

Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS collects logs from different AWS sources to produce data in the dashboards. When you install the solution, data will be collected from sources, including:
* [Amazon CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html)
* [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html)
* [AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html)
* [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)
* [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html)

## Before you deploy Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS

This section describes prerequisites and guidelines for deploying Sumo Logic’s Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution. 

### Prerequisites

* **AWS data**. You must have access to data from the following AWS products, since Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS uses data from these sources in its dashboards:
   * [Amazon CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html)
   * [Amazon GuardDuty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings.html)
   * [AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html)
   * [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)
   * [AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html)
* **Sumo Logic console**. Make sure you have access to the [Sumo Logic console](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/).
* **Role capabilities**. Make sure you have a Sumo Logic role that has the following [role capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/):
  * Data Management
     * View Collectors
     * Manage Collectors
     * Manage Content
     * Manage Apps
  * Security
     * Create access keys
  * Alerting
     * View Monitors
     * Manage Monitors
* **Sumo Logic Access ID and Key**. When you deploy the solution, you’ll need to supply a Sumo Logic [Access ID and Access Key](/docs/manage/security/access-keys/), which enable you to use Sumo Logic APIs. Make sure you have the role capabilities listed above before generating the Access ID and Key.
* **AWS credentials**. To deploy the solution, you will need to log onto the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console). For the CloudFormation template deployment, your AWS role must have the permissions described by [this JSON file](https://sumologic-appdev-aws-sam-apps.s3.amazonaws.com/AWSCISCFTemplatePermissions.json). As necessary, you may add JSON text to an existing or a new policy associated with an AWS IAM role as described in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-and-attach-iam-policy.html). You can set this up during installation. For more information, see [Create new source: Check AWS role permission](#create-new-source-check-aws-role-permission).
* **Monitors**. The Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution comes with pre-packaged alerts in the form of Sumo Logic Monitors. To learn more about their capabilities, visit the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/) page.

### AWS regions supported

You can deploy Cloud Security Infrastructure for AWS to a single AWS account and region or multiple accounts and regions. Typically you would first deploy the solution to a single AWS account and region, kick the tires, and then expand the deployment.

The Sumo Logic Cloud Infrastructure Security solution supports the following [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions):
* Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
* Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
* Asia Pacific (Seoul)
* Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
* Asia Pacific (Singapore)
* Asia Pacific (Sydney)
* Canada (Central)
* Europe (Frankfurt)
* Europe (Stockholm)
* Europe (Ireland)
* Europe (London)
* Europe (Paris)
* Middle East (Bahrain)
* South America (São Paulo)
* US East (N. Virginia)
* US East (Ohio)
* US West (N. California)
* US West (Oregon)

### Deployment considerations  

When you deploy the solution, consider the following.

#### Do you already have the required sources? 

When you deploy, you are given the option to create the Sumo Logic sources that the solution applications rely upon. If you have already configured those sources, you do not have to create new ones. You can just provide the URLs of the relevant Sumo Logic sources as part of the configuration. See [Install Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS](/docs/security/cloud-infrastructure-security/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws/#install-cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws) below.

:::note
If you use existing sources rather than create new ones, it is not necessary to modify the existing metadata and source categories associated with the sources. The metadata that the solution depends on will be added to the sources at deployment time. 
:::

#### Bucket considerations

In the sections of the CloudFormation template that relate to creating Sumo Logic sources, you can specify an existing S3 bucket to store the logs that the source collects. If you don’t supply a bucket name, the template will create a new one. We recommend you use an existing bucket if possible. See [Create new source: Deploy AWS](#create-new-source-deploy-aws) below.

#### Account or organization deployment

You can deploy Cloud Infrastructure Security to a single account or all accounts in your AWS organization. See [Create new source: Deploy AWS](#create-new-source-deploy-aws) below.

#### Multi-region enablement 

Cloud Infrastructure Security supports collecting data from multiple regions if you have any of the following services running in multiple regions in your AWS infrastructure. You can enable multiple regions when you perform the steps in the [Create new source: Deploy AWS](/docs/security/cloud-infrastructure-security/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws/#create-new-source-deploy-aws) section below.

##### GuardDuty

While deploying, enter comma-separated values for regions in the following section:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-guardduty-multi-regions.png')} alt="GuardDuty regions" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

##### SecurityHub

While deploying, enter comma-separated values for regions in the following section:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-security-hub-multi-regions.png')} alt="Security Hub regions" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

##### CloudTrail

On the AWS side, [configure CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.html) to deliver log files from multiple regions to a single S3 bucket for a single account, and use that S3 bucket in the following section:

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-cloudtrail-multi-regions.png')} alt="CloudTrail S3 bucket configuration" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

:::note
If an S3 bucket is created by the Cloud Infrastructure Security solution, then make sure on the AWS side that it is a central bucket for CloudTrail logs for all regions from the AWS side.
:::

##### AWS Firewall Manager

On the AWS side, [configure Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/logging-s3.html) to deliver log files from multiple regions to a single S3 bucket for a single account, and use that S3 bucket in the following section: 

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-network-firewall-multi-regions.png')} alt="Network Firewall S3 bucket configuration" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

:::note
If the S3 bucket is created by the Cloud Infrastructure Security solution, then make sure on the AWS side that it is a central bucket for Network Firewall for all regions.
:::

##### AWS WAF

Configure WAF in each region to send logs to [Kinesis data firehose destination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-destinations.html), and from there, use the same [Sumo Logic’s Kinesis HTTP URL](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-kinesis-firehose-logs-source/) in Firehose configuration to send logs to Sumo Logic.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-waf-multi-regions-1.png')} alt="Firehose destination settings" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-waf-multi-regions-2.png')} alt="Sumo Logic destination settings in Firehose" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

:::note
If Sumo Logic’s Kinesis Firehose source is created by the Cloud Infrastructure Security solution, then make sure on the AWS side that the same Sumo Logic Kinesis HTTP URL is used while configuring the WAF Logging Kinesis destination.

1. For each of the data source types listed, select whether to use an existing source, create a new source, or do not collect data for that source type:
    * **Use Existing Source**. Select this option if collection is already set up for that particular service and data is coming into Sumo Logic under a specific _sourceCategory. Select the _sourceCategory from the dropdown menu.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-install-0a.png')} alt="Use Existing Source selection" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
    * **Create New Source**. Select this option when you want to set up Sumo Logic collection for that particular service. Type the name you want to use for the source. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-install-0b.png')} alt="Create New Source selection" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
    * **Do Not Collect**. Select this option if you do not want to collect data from that particular service. If you choose this option, then collection for the service will not be set up and the corresponding dashboards in the Cloud Infrastructure Security  solution will not contain data. 
1. Click **Next**. <br/>Depending on what you selected, one of the following occurs:
    * If you selected only **Use Existing Source** or **Do Not Collect**, the solution is installed. Proceed to [Start using the solution](#start-using-the-solution).

       :::tip
       Using only existing sources is the easiest way to install, since it means you don't have to create any new sources.
       :::

    * If you selected **Create New Source** for *any* source, the following screen appears. You must perform the steps in the following sections:
       * [Create new source: Select region](#create-new-source-select-region)
       * [Create new source: Check AWS Role Permission](#create-new-source-check-aws-role-permission)
       * [Create new source: Deploy AWS](#create-new-source-deploy-aws) <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-install-1.png')} alt="Deploy Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="700"/>

### Create new source: Select region

If you selected **Create New Source** for any source on the [**Configure Sources** screen](#install-cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws), in the **Select Region** section select the [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html#Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.Regions) where you want to deploy the solution. 

For information about where your Sumo Logic data is stored in AWS, see [Where is My Data Stored?](/docs/get-started/faq/#where-is-my-data-stored)

To collect data from multiple regions, see [Multi-region enablement](#multi-region-enablement).

:::info
This step is critical. If you do not select the correct region, you will deploy the solution in the wrong region.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-installed.png')} alt="The screen of the installed solution" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>

## Troubleshoot installation

Installation of Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS uses an AWS CloudFormation template. While deploying using the template, you may receive error messages such as `CREATE_FAILED` status or `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` status for various reasons. This section provides information on how to troubleshoot such AWS CloudFormation installation failures.

#### Determine the cause of a CloudFormation installation failure

This section walks you through the process of troubleshooting an AWS CloudFormation installation failure.

To debug an AWS CloudFormation installation failure, do the following:

1. After the stack rollback is complete and the status is `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`, go to the parent stack. In the parent stack, look for the first failure as shown in the following example. The failure can be a direct reason or can point to a nested stack. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_1.png')} alt="A screenshot of the stack with the words circled 'Rollback complete'" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
1. Look for direct reasons for the failure that is available in the parent stack, as shown in the following example. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_2.png')} alt="A screenshot of the stack with the words circled 'Failed to create resource. 401 client error.'" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
1. To find indirect reasons for the failure, go to the nested stack mentioned in the status reason, as shown in the following example. Take a note of the resources mentioned in the reason. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_3.png')} alt="Screenshot with the words circled 'Embedded stack'" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>
1. Select the deleted option to find the nested stacks, as shown in the following example.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_4.png')} alt="Deleted selected from the dropdown menu" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400"/>
1. Go to the nested stack and look for the resource mentioned in the previous step to identify the reason, as shown in the following example.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/Troubleshooting_5.png')} alt="Screenshot showing a line saying 'Failed to create resource. 401 client error. Credential could not be verified.'" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

#### Optimize CloudTrail log ingest

By default, the Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS solution collects AWS CloudTrail logs for all AWS services. To reduce ingestion volume, you can define processing rules that limit log collection to only the logs that are relevant to dashboards provided by the solution.

Define the processing rules for the Sumo Logic AWS CloudTrail Source that was created when you ran the CloudFormation template.

For instructions, see [Create a Processing Rule](/docs/send-data/collection/processing-rules/create-processing-rule/). Create the following rules, selecting Include messages that match as the rule type, using these regular expressions:

```
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticloadbalancing\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"dynamodb\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ec2\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"rds\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"lambda\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"apigateway\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ecs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticache\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sns\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sqs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
```

#### Common errors

Below are some common errors that can occur while using the CloudFormation template. 

| Error | Description | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|
| The API rate limit for this user has been exceeded. | This error indicates that AWS CloudFormation execution has exceeded the API rate limit set on the Sumo Logic side. It can occur if you install the AWS CloudFormation template in multiple regions or accounts using the same Access Key and Access ID. | Do not install the AWS CloudFormation template in multiple regions or accounts with the same Access Key and Access ID. |
| S3 Bucket already exists. | The error can occur if:<br/>- An S3 bucket with the same name exists in  S3, or <br/>- The S3 Bucket is not present in S3 but is referenced by some other AWS CloudFormation stack which created it. |- Remove the S3 bucket from S3 or select “No” in the AWS Cloudformation template for S3 bucket creation. <br/>- Remove the AWS CloudFormation Stack which references the S3 bucket. |
| The S3 bucket you tried to delete is not empty. | The error can occur when deleting the stack with a non-empty S3 bucket. | Delete the S3 bucket manually if you do not need the bucket or its content in the future. |

#### Roll back the Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS Solution

When you roll back the solution, all the resources that were created with the AWS CloudFormation stack are deleted. The resources deleted with a rollback include dashboards, collectors, sources, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscriptions. 

Rolling back the solution deletes the main AWS CloudFormation stack, including the nested stack and associated Sumo Logic and AWS resources. The following rollback guidelines apply:

* Sumo Logic resources are deleted based on the “Delete Sumo Logic Resources when the stack is deleted” flag provided during the AWS CloudFormation configuration. These resources include dashboards, collectors, and sources.
* AWS resources are deleted by default, regardless of the flag provided. These resources include S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscription.

To uninstall the Cloud Infrastructure Security solution:

1. Log in to your AWS account and go to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home).
1. Select the main stack you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/observability/CFT_Uninstall.png')} alt="Delete button in the upper right part of the screen" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800"/>

## Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS monitors

Following are monitors included with the solution:

* **Admin Privileges Granted**. Detects when administrative privileges are granted to a user or role. This is crucial for monitoring and controlling access to sensitive resources and ensuring that only authorized personnel have administrative capabilities.
* **Amazon GuardDuty BruteForce finding**. Alerts on brute force attacks detected by Amazon GuardDuty. These attacks typically involve repeated attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system using various password combinations.
* **Amazon GuardDuty InstanceCredentialExfiltration finding**. Triggers when GuardDuty detects potential exfiltration of instance credentials. This could indicate that an attacker is attempting to steal and use the credentials outside of the AWS environment.
* **CloudTrail Changes**. Monitors changes in AWS CloudTrail configurations, which track API calls and activities in your AWS account. Changes to CloudTrail could indicate attempts to hide malicious activities.
* **Config Changes**. Tracks changes to AWS Config settings. AWS Config monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
* **Critical GuardDuty Alerts**. Alerts on critical severity findings from Amazon GuardDuty. These findings typically indicate severe security threats that require immediate attention and remediation.
* **EC2 instance accessed from malicious IP**. Alerts when an EC2 instance is accessed from an IP address identified as malicious by threat intelligence feeds. This could signify a potential breach or unauthorized access attempt.
* **High Severity GuardDuty Alerts**. Triggers on high severity findings from Amazon GuardDuty, indicating significant security threats that need prompt investigation and action.
* **Important GuardDuty Alerts**. Alerts on important severity findings from Amazon GuardDuty. These findings are notable and should be investigated to ensure they do not escalate into more severe issues.
* **Landspeed Violations**. Detects landspeed violations, which generally refer to unusual and rapid movements of data or activities across different regions that could indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized operations.
* **Low Severity GuardDuty Alerts**. Monitors low severity findings from Amazon GuardDuty. While these findings may not require immediate action, they should be reviewed to ensure they do not evolve into more significant threats.
* **Medium Severity GuardDuty Alerts**. Alerts on medium severity findings from Amazon GuardDuty. These findings indicate moderate security threats that should be investigated and addressed appropriately.
* **Root Account Login**. Triggers when there is a login to the AWS root account. Root account access should be highly restricted and monitored due to its unrestricted access to all resources in the account.

## Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS dashboards​

import FilterDashboards from '../../reuse/filter-dashboards.md';

<FilterDashboards/>

### Recommended investigations workflow

To most efficiently use the solution to address security concerns, we recommend using the dashboards in the following workflow:
1. Look at the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview) dashboard to get an overall picture of the security posture of your environment. Pivot or browse to other dashboards to see details in each area.
1. Look at activity displayed in the [Active Threats](#active-threats-dashboards) dashboards to find issues that need immediate attention.
1. View the [Security Control Failures](#security-control-failures---aws-security-hub) dashboard to find areas that are identified as failing to meet compliance requirements, and therefore possibly pose a security risk.
1. Review the [Suspicious Activity](#suspicious-activity-dashboards) dashboards to uncover suspicious activity that may need investigation.
1. Pivot into the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview) dashboard for specific resources that have issues to see any related activity. Review the action plan presented at the bottom of the dashboard to work through the items identified as needing attention.

### Risk Overview

The **Risk Overview** dashboard provides a summary of all resources that pose risks in a single dashboard that rolls up the findings from other dashboards. It also shows AWS API events by time, and has an **Action Plan** panel so you can access resources that need attention.

You can also use this dashboard to show details of a single resource. See [View resource risk details](#view-resource-risk-details) below.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-risk-overview.png')} alt="Risk Overview dashboard" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>

#### View resource risk details

You can click a resource on any dashboard to view details about its risk in the [Risk Overview](#risk-overview) dashboard:
1. Click a resource in a dashboard. A summary of that resource’s data appears in a panel.
1. In the panel under **Linked Dashboards**, select **Risk Overview**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-for-aws-linked-dashboard.png')} alt="Linked dashboard" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
1. The selected resource’s data appears in the **Risk Overview** dashboard, broken down by the types of data collected. This lets you see at a glance all the different risks presented by the resource. Note at the top of the dashboard that the filters specify the resource.

### Active threats dashboards

The Active Threats dashboards show data on threats that require attention. Review these dashboards to see threats identified in AWS APIs, resources, and storage.

#### Active Threats: AWS APIs

The **Active Threats: AWS APIs** dashboard shows threats identified from AWS APIs by correlating it with threat intelligence data. It shows threats count and trend, and threats by resource, actor, events, and geo location.
