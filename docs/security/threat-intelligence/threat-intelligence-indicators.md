The **Threat Intelligence** tab shows the indicators that have been added to your threat intelligence datastore. Use this tab to add and manage your threat intelligence indicators. You can add indicators from a number of sources. Threat intelligence indicators imported to Sumo Logic not only integrate with your existing core Sumo Logic deployment, but also Cloud SIEM and Cloud SOAR. 

:::tip
You can also add threat intelligence indicators using a collector or the API. See [Ingest threat intelligence indicators](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/about-threat-intelligence/#ingest-threat-intelligence-indicators).

1. Click the **Delete Indicators** button. 
<!-- 1. When the following dialog appears, select which indicators you'd like to delete from the source:<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/security/threat-intelligence-delete-indicators.png')} alt="Delete threat intelligence indicators" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />
   * **Delete all indicators**. Remove all indicators from the source.
   * **Delete indicators matching the expression**. Enter the attribute and value to match. For example, if you want to delete indicators with certain "valid until" dates from **Sumo normalized JSON** files, for an attribute enter `validUntil` and for a value enter a date. The attributes and values you enter must match attributes and values in the indicators. -->
1. Click **Delete** on the **Delete Indicators** dialog.

## Change the retention period for expired indicators

Indicators are deemed valid until they reach the date set by their "valid until" attribute (`validUntil` for [normalized JSON](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/upload-formats/#normalized-json-format) and [CSV](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/upload-formats/#csv-format), and `valid_until` for [STIX](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/upload-formats/#stix-2x-json-format)). After that date, they are considered expired.

Expired indicators are retained until they reach the end of the retention period. At the end of the retention period, expired indicators are automatically deleted. Between the time they expire and are deleted, the indicators are still in the system, and you can search against them if you want.

By default, expired indicators are retained for 180 days. To change the retention period:
1. [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/).In the main Sumo Logic menu, select **Manage Data > Logs > Threat Intelligence**. <br/>[**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui/). In the top menu select **Configuration**, and then under **Logs** select **Threat Intelligence**. You can also click the **Go To...** menu at the top of the screen and select **Threat Intelligence**.  
1. Click the three-dot button in the upper-right corner of the page.
1. Click **Edit Retention Period**. 
1. Enter the length of time in days to retain expired threat intelligence indicator files. The maximum number of days is 180. 

:::note
When you change the retention period, the event is recorded in the Audit Event Index. See [Audit logging for threat intelligence](/docs/security/threat-intelligence/about-threat-intelligence/#audit-logging-for-threat-intelligence).
:::

You do not have to wait until indicators reach the end of their retention period in order to delete them. You can [use the **Threat Intelligence** tab to delete indicators](#delete-threat-intelligence-indicators), as well as use the APIs in the [Threat Intel Ingest Management](https://api.sumologic.com/docs/#tag/threatIntelIngest) API resource.
