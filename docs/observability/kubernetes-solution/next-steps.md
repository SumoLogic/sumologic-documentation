## Data Enrichment

Data enrichment is the process of adding meaningful information to your data so you have more control and an easier time referencing data in searches. It's simply where you add more context to your data. Data enrichment augments Sumo Logic's centralized data collection capabilities to make the process of searching and finding data quicker and easier.

## Dashboard (New)

The [Sumo Logic Dashboard (New)](/docs/dashboards-new) platform allows you to analyze metric and log data on the same dashboard, in a streamlined user experience. This is exactly what you need to create custom dashboards to more effectively monitor and manage a Kubernetes environment.
