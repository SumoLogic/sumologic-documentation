## Next Steps

Once you've set up collection, installed Kubernetes apps, and familiarized yourself with the dashboards. Now you want to become more adept at monitoring and troubleshooting your applications in your Kubernetes environment. Here are a few options for you to explore.

Once you have completed the above steps, you'll have installed the collection as well as the core Kubernetes Dashboards and alerts. To get started, open a new **Explore** tab in Sumo Logic and view your Kubernetes App Dashboards.
