As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Sumo Logic service, our product team has deprecated Root Cause Explorer, and it is no longer available as of 27 May 2025. After observing low customer usage trends for Root Cause Explorer over time since its release, we believe this to be the best course of action and refocus our development efforts towards more critical features in the product.

## Why is this happening?

* **Low customer usage**. Data collected over the past year indicates significantly low engagement with Root Cause Explorer, with only a small fraction of our user base utilizing the feature. This trend suggests that the feature does not meet a broad user need or has not been effectively integrated into user workflows.
* **Limited scope and effectiveness**. Root Cause Explorer operates within a narrow scope, limiting its applicability across our user base. While user feedback indicates that the tool excels at visualizing different drifts and events of interest, it falls short in effectively identifying the underlying cause of issues.

## What is happening?

After the end-of-life date of Root Cause Explorer on 27 May 2025, the feature is no longer available both as an independent operation from the main Sumo Logic page and from within the Entity Inspector pages.

## What do I need to do?

There are no specific preparations or actions that customers need to take as a result of this deprecation and end-of-life. As of the end-of-life date, while Root Cause Explorer will no longer be available in the Sumo Logic interface. Its removal will not have any effect on other existing features and functions that customers may be using.
