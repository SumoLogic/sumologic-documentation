title: Supported Tools and Schema
description: Learn which Tools and Schema are supported by Software Development Optimization Solution.
---

The Software Development Optimization (SDO) Solution comes bundled with Terraform support for the following tools in each phase of the DevOps lifecycle. While tools not listed in the table below lack Terraform support for automated installation, virtually any DevOps tool can be configured to work with SDO through manual configuration by transforming the structure of data ingested by these tools — using Sumo Logic Field Extraction Rules (FERs) — to adhere to the schema defined below.

| DevOps Phases             | Supported with Terraform                                          |
|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Planning Phase            | Jira Cloud, Jira Server                                   |
| Dev/Code                  | GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab                                 |
| Build/Test/Deploy/Release | Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, CircleCI  Pipelines, GitLab |
| Monitor/Operate           | PagerDuty, Opsgenie                                       |

## Software Development Optimization dashboards

The apps and dashboards that are part of this solution are organized into:

* Tool specific dashboards that are based on the logs from individual DevOps tools to monitor the operations and security of individual tools.
* Dashboards that are based on an abstracted schema to monitor DORA metrics and the stages of your CI/CD pipelines across various phases. This is done so that you don’t have to change individual dashboard queries when you replace your tools, as well as to accommodate application development teams that have their own tool sets.

##  Schema Overview

As discussed earlier, the abstraction of tools is achieved via a common event schema model, where events from DevOps tools are mapped to fields via Sumo Logic [Field Extraction Rules (FERs)](/docs/manage/field-extractions). 

This model also enables you to integrate events from any of your tools, that may not be supported at present to the Software Development Optimization solution.

## Schema Definition

The tables below show the schema for various events from DevOps pipeline. These fields are required by Software Development Optimization Solutions dashboards and queries.

## Examples

The mapping of events from tool sets to this event schema is achieved via Sumo Logic [FERs](/docs/manage/field-extractions/create-field-extraction-rule.md). For Example, For [PagerDuty V2 Incidents](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/webhooks/v2-overview/), we map the incident payload to the alert event schema using the following **Parse Expression.**

```
parse regex "(?<event>\{\"event\":\"incident\..+?\}(?=,\{\"event\":\"incident\..+|\]\}$))"
|json  field=event "event", "created_on", "incident" as alert_type, dateTime, incident
|json field=incident "id",  "service.name" , "urgency", "teams[0].summary", "html_url"  as alert_id, service, priority, team, link
|json  field=incident "created_at" as closeddate nodrop
| where alert_type in ("incident.trigger", "incident.resolve")
| parseDate(dateTime, "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'") as dateTime_epoch
| parseDate(closeddate, "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'") as closeddate_epoch
| if (alert_type matches "*trigger", "alert_created", if(alert_type matches "*resolve", "alert_closed", "other") ) as event_type
```

The field extraction rule created is shown in the diagram below: 

![pagerduty-v2-alerts.png](/img/sdo/pagerduty-v2-alerts.png)


Examples of mapping field extraction rules to the other out-of-the-box tools can be found in [this JSON file](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-solution-templates/blob/master/software-development-optimization-terraform/sdo_app_artifacts/sdo_fer.txt).

## Enriching the schema with additional fields

You can add additional fields such as project, product, or server names to the above schema by following the steps below: 

1. Modify the existing set of FERs, by adding a new field in the definition of that FER . For example, if you are modifying the Sumo Logic Jenkins FER, then you can add this field either in:
    * The [SumoUpload](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sumologic-publisher-plugin#sumoupload) function in the Jenkins plugin.
    * Add [metadata fields](/docs/manage/fields) at the Sumo Logic source.  
1. Write and test Sumo Logic searches using this new field to derive the insights you want.
1. Add [panels](/docs/dashboards/panels) based on the above searches to the existing set of dashboards.
1. Add [filters](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables) to the dashboards.
