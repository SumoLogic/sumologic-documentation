## DORA Metrics Dashboards

These dashboards calculate four DORA metrics that help measure application release velocity and availability. The Software Development Optimization - DORA Metrics dashboard resides in the top-level folder created at app install time and detailed dashboards that help you drill-down into the individual metrics reside in the DORA Metrics folder.

### SDO - DORA Metrics Overview

The **Software Development Optimization- DORA Metrics Overview** dashboard calculates the four key DORA metrics identified in the [State of DevOps](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) report, which help you measure application development velocity and application reliability. 

The four metrics are: 

* Lead time, which quantifies how long it takes to go from code commit to completed production deployment. This is identified by the time taken from when a merge commit event occurs to when that commit is successfully deployed to production.
* Deployment Frequency measures how often code is deployed to production.
* Time to restore service measures the average elapsed time from when a service incident occurs to when it is resolved. This is calculated by the time it takes to close a priority 1 or most critical incident once opened.
* Change Failure rate describes the percentage of deployments to production that subsequently requires remediation (For example, by rolling a release back or deploying a hotfix). This is the percentage of the number of priority one or critical incidents to the number of successful deploys to production.

Use this dashboard to:

* Understand the effectiveness of the development and delivery process in terms of application development velocity and reliability.
* Monitor trends for each metric to identify any unexpected peaks and lows.
* Understand how the DORA metrics apply to each team, service, and application environment.

### SDO - Development & Delivery Times

The **Software Development Optimization - Development & Delivery Times** dashboard helps you monitor both development lead times as well as delivery lead times across the three main phases of development and delivery:

* **Active Development** is the time it takes for developers to begin development on application code and have that code ready for peer review.
* **Review & Merge** is the time it takes for peers to review the code change, the developer to make any necessary changes, and to finally merge the code.
* **Deployment** is the time it takes for merged code changes to be deployed to application environments.

![lead-time.png](/img/sdo/lead-time.png)

The dashboard will not only show the rate of changes as it goes through the three phases of development and delivery, but also show the phases broken down by team, service, and environment.

Use this dashboard to:

* Measure the throughput and quality of application changes
* Measure the adoption of teams practicing small batch application development and delivery
* Measure the impact of process improvements on application services and environments

#### How each phase of development is measured

The dashboard measures the time code spends in active development, review, and delivery. The method varies from the VCS tools used like BitBucket, GitHub, and GitLab.

**How Active Development is measured:**

* For each merged pull request, measure the time between the first commit push to the time the pull request was ready for review. “Ready for review” is measured by:
 * For Bitbucket and GitLab: The time the PR was created
 * For GitHub: The time the PR was marked as “Ready for Review”

* Average the Active Development time for each PR merged in the given timeframe issued by each team and for each service

**How Review Time is measured:**

* For each merged pull request, measure the time between the pull request being ready for review and it being merged.  “Ready for review” is measured by:
 * For Bitbucket and GitLab: The time the PR was created
 * For GitHub: The time the PR was marked as “Ready for Review”

* Average the Review Time for each PR merged in the given timeframe issued by each team and for each service

**Important limitations:**

For the Active Development and Review & Merge times to be accurate, the following development workflows/practices must be used:

* New application development must be on feature branches and merged into a main branch.
* Pull requests are created when the code change is ready for review, or for GitHub specifically, pull requests are marked as “Ready for Review”.
