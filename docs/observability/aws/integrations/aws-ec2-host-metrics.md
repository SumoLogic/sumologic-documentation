[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, enabling you to complete control of your computing resources. The Sumo Logic app for AWS EC2 (Host metrics) collects local host metrics and displays them using predefined search queries and dashboards. App dashboards provide a visual analysis of local host metrics for CPU, disk, memory, network, and TCP.

## Metrics Types 

Host metrics are gathered by the open-source [SIGAR library](https://github.com/hyperic/sigar). The metrics that are collected are described in [Host Metrics for Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors/sources/host-metrics-source/#collected-metrics).

* [CPU Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics/#cpu-metrics)
* [Memory Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics/#memory-metrics)
* [TCP Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics/#tcp-metrics)
* [Networking Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics/#networking-metrics)
* [Disk Metrics](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/host-metrics/#disk-metrics)

### Time Intervals

The time interval determines how frequently the source is scanned for metrics data. Sumo Logic supports pre-specified time intervals (10 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 5 minutes).

You can also specify a time interval in JSON by using the interval parameter, as follows: `"interval" : 60000`.

The JSON parameter is in milliseconds. We recommend 60 seconds (60000 ms) or longer granularity. Specifying a shorter interval will increase the message volume and could cause your deployment to incur additional charges.

### AWS Metadata

Collectors running on Host Metrics (EC2) instances can optionally collect AWS Metadata such as EC2 tags to make it easier to search for Host Metrics.  Only one AWS Metadata Source for Metrics is required to collect EC2 tags from multiple hosts. For more information, see [AWS Metadata Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/aws-metadata-tag-source/).

### Sample Query 

```sql title="CPU utilization (Host metric based)"
metric=CPU_Sys _sourcecategory=Labs/AWS/Host/Metrics _sourceHost=* _collector=* _source = * account=* region=* instancetype=* namespace=hostmetrics instanceid=* | avg
```

## Viewing AWS EC2 Host Metrics Dashboards

This page provides examples and descriptions for each of the AWS Observability Host EC2 metrics pre-configured dashboards.

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, enabling you to complete control of your computing resources.

The Sumo Logic **AWS Observability EC2 metrics dashboards** collect local host metrics and displays them using dashboards to aid troubleshooting issues and optimize resource allocation and costs. App dashboards provide a visual analysis of local host metrics for CPU, disk, memory, network, and TCP traffic.

:::note
We highly recommend you view these dashboards in the [Explore View](../deploy-use-aws-observability/view-dashboards.md) of the AWS Observability solution.

### 1.2. AWS EC2 Overview (Host OS metrics)

The **AWS EC2 Overview (Host OS metrics)** dashboard provides insights into EC2 performance throughout your infrastructure, including CPU utilization, network rates, disk, and memory usage.

Use this dashboard to:

* Quickly identify instances with high and low CPU and memory utilization.
* Monitor average statistics across various resource dimensions across all of your EC2 instances.
* Identify resource usage patterns and deviations across instance types to determine which instance types should be resized.
* Monitor average CPU utilization by instance type.
