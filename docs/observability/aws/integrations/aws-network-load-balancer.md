description: The Sumo Logic Observability integration for AWS Network Load Balancer provides insights to ensure that your network load-balancers are operating as expected, backend hosts are healthy and to quickly identify errors.
---

The AWS Network Load Balancer service is distributed in OSI Layer 4 (i.e., network) traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP, TLS) and can handle over a million requests per second. 

The AWS Network Load Balancer dashboards provide insights to ensure that your network load-balancers are operating as expected, backend hosts are healthy and to quickly identify errors.

### Log and Metric Types

The AWS Network Load Balancer app uses the following logs and metrics:

* [AWS Network Load Balancer metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html)

### Sample Query (Metric based) 

Active Flows (Connections) by Load Balancer:

```sql
Namespace=aws/NetworkELB metric=ActiveFlowCount Statistic=Sum account=dev region=us-east-1 LoadBalancer=* | sum by account, region, namespace, LoadBalancer
```

## AWS Network Load Balancer Dashboards

The AWS Network Load Balancer service is distributed in OSI Layer 4
(i.e., network) traffic (e.g., TCP, UDP, TLS) and can handle over a
million requests per second. 

The AWS Network Load Balancer dashboards provide insights to ensure that
your network load-balancers are operating as expected, backend hosts are
healthy and to quickly identify errors.

### 1. AWS Network Load Balancer - Overview

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Overview** dashboard provides detailed
insights into a view of network utilization and performance. The
dashboard provides information about the errors, health, and traffic
handled by the load balancer.

Use this dashboard to: 

* Get an at-a-glance view of the number of errors and status of backend hosts. 
* Identify load balancers with the most number of unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor trends around active connections, bytes processed, and reset packets to ensure load balancers are operating as expected.

### 1. Amazon Network Load Balancer - Active and New Flows

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Active and New Flows** dashboard
provides detailed insights for new flows, and active flows for TCP, TLS,
and UDP traffic.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor trends around active and new flows (connections) to make sure they line up with expectations and then use that information to scale up/scale down backend hosts.

### 2. AWS Network Load Balancer - Host Health Status

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Host Health Status** dashboard
provides detailed insights into the number of healthy and unhealthy
hosts.

Use this dashboard to:

* Get a quick overview of the number of healthy and unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor trends around the number of unhealthy hosts to spot potential service disruptions that could warrant deeper investigation.

### 3. AWS Network Load Balancer - Errors

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Errors** dashboard provides detailed
insights into the errors reported by the network load balancer. This
dashboard shows information for the total number of TLS handshakes that
failed during negotiation between a client and a TLS listener, and the
total number of TLS handshakes that failed during negotiation between a
TLS listener and a target.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor TLS handshake errors during negotiation between a client and a TLS listener, which could happen if clients are sending an incorrect cipher or are using incorrect protocols not matching the one specified in the security policy. It’s recommended to use the most recent AWS CLI client version.
* Monitor TLS handshake errors during negotiation between a TLS listener and a target. Possible causes for this error include a mismatch of ciphers or protocols.

### 4. AWS Network Load Balancer - Reset (RST) Packets

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Reset (RST) Packets** dashboard
provides detailed insights into the number reset (RST) packets received
by the network load balancer. The dashboard shows the information for
the total number of reset (RST) packets sent from a client to a target ,
the total number of reset (RST) packets generated by the load balancer,
and the total number of reset (RST) packets sent from a target to a
client.

Use this dashboard to:

* To monitor the number of RST packets. A high number of reset packets could indicate connections are getting dropped and could mean a disruption in service.

### 5. AWS Network Load Balancer - Processed Bytes

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Processed Bytes** dashboard provides
detailed insights into the amount of bytes processed by the load
balancer for total, UDP, TCP and TLS traffic.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor trends around processed bytes to make sure they line up with expectations and then use that information to scale up or scale down backend hosts.

### 6. AWS Network Load Balancer - Consumed LCUs

**The AWS Network Load Balancer - Consumed LCUs** dashboard shows you
the total number of load balancer capacity units (LCU) used by your load
balancer by network protocol.

**Note**: You pay for the number of LCUs that you use per hour.

Use this dashboard to:

* Optimize load balancer costs by monitoring trends around the number of load balancer capacity units (LCU) used by network protocol.
