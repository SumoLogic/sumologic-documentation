---

Amazon ElastiCache allows you to set up, run, and scale popular open-source compatible in-memory data stores in the cloud.

The Amazon ElastiCache dashboards provide visibility into key event and performance analytics that enable proactive diagnosis and response to system and environment issues. Use the preconfigured dashboards for at-a-glance analysis of event status trends, locations, successes and failures, as well as system health and performance metrics. The dashboards also have additional performance insights for Redis clusters.

## Log and metrics types

The Amazon ElastiCache app uses the following logs and metrics:

* [Amazon ElastiCache Host Level metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheMetrics.HostLevel.html)
* [Amazon ElastiCache Redis metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheMetrics.Redis.html)
* [CloudTrail Amazon ElastiCache Data Event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/logging-using-cloudtrail.html)

## Amazon ElastiCache dashboards

import FilterDashboards from '../../../reuse/filter-dashboards.md';

<FilterDashboards/>

### 1. Amazon ElastiCache - Host Performance Overview

The **Amazon ElastiCache - Host Performance Overview** dashboard provides detailed insights into CPU, memory and network performance metrics of hosts running your ElastiCache clusters.  

Use this dashboard to:

* Get an at-a-glance view  of CPU, memory and swap resource utilization of hosts running your ElastiCache clusters.
* CPU, memory or swap space on host and swap usage.
* Monitor network traffic utilization and compare today’s trends of incoming and outgoing bytes and packets vs. yesterday

### 2. Amazon ElastiCache - Audit Event Overview

The **Amazon ElastiCache - Audit Event Overview** dashboard provides detailed insights into all events associated with ElastiCache clusters and specifically helps identify changes, errors, users and replication groups.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor all changes being made to ElastiCache clusters
* Monitor the location of incoming user activity , top users, and top replication groups to ensure they match with expectations
* Quickly identify top error codes to diagnose any outages
* Monitor trends around failed events to identify potential service disruptions that could warrant deeper investigation

### 2. Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Performance Details

The **Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Performance Details** dashboard provides detailed insights into cache hits, keys, replication, connections and failures of Redis ElastiCache clusters. 

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor trends around cache hits and misses to determine if Redis clusters need to be tuned
* Review trends around defragmentation, replication lag and bytes replicated to determine optimizations

### 3. Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Command Latency

The **Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Command Latency** dashboard provides detailed insights into latency of various Redis commands.

Use this dashboard to:

* Optimize performance of your Redis clusters by monitoring latency observed across get/set operations. Latency can be high due to high CPU usage, swapping or removing cached items. Performance optimizations can therefore be made either via resource allocation or by optimizing on caching.

### 4. Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Command Stats

The **Amazon ElastiCache - Redis Command Stats** dashboard provides detailed insights into the number of commands being performed. 

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor various Get and Set commands received by your ElastiCache clusters and nodes
* Correlate with the Redis Command Latency dashboard to identify most/least frequently used and least performant command types

:::note
If high latency commands are not being processed frequently, you will want to look into monitoring and potentially allocating more CPU resources.
