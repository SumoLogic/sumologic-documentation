description: Gain visibility into the health of the Application Load Balancer and target groups in your AWS environment. Use the preconfigured dashboards to understand the latency, request and host status, threat intel, and HTTP backend codes by availability zone and target group.
---

The [AWS Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) functions at the application layer receive requests, evaluates the listener rules in priority order to determine which rule to apply, and then selects a target from the target group. 

The Sumo Logic App for AWS Observability Application Load Balancer is a unified logs and metrics (ULM) App that gives you visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups. Use the pre-configured dashboards to understand the latency, request and host status, threat intel, and HTTP backend codes by availability zone and target group.

## Log and Metric Types 

The AWS Application Load Balancer ULM App uses the following log and metric types:

* Metrics included in the AWS/ApplicationELB namespace. For more details, see this [*AWS Services help*](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html#load-balancer-metrics-alb) page. 
* The [Application Load Balancer Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging) Log introduces two new fields in addition to the fields contained in Classic ELB Access log:
  * **Type.** This is the type of request or connection (HTTP, HTTPS, H2, ws, wss)
  * **Target_group_arn**. This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group

The logs are stored in a .gzip format in the specified S3 bucket and contain these fields in this order: timestamp, elb, client:port, target:port, request_processing_time, target_processing_time, response_processing_time, elb_status_code, target_status_code, received_bytes, sent_bytes, request, user_agent, ssl_cipher, ssl_protocol, target_group_arn, trace_id. For more details on the ALB Access log, see the [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-access-logs.html#enable-access-logging).

## AWS Application Load Balancer Dashboards

This page provides examples and descriptions for each of the AWS Observability Application Load Balancer pre-configured dashboards.

The AWS Application Load Balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. The load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones. 

The Sumo Logic AWS Observability Application Load Balancer Dashboards provides visibility into the health of Application Load Balancer and target groups in your AWS environment. Use the pre-configured dashboards to understand the load, errors, response codes, and latency by target groups, hosts as well as requests from malicious sources, and HTTP response codes.

:::note
We highly recommend you view these dashboards in the [Explore View](../deploy-use-aws-observability/view-dashboards.md) of the AWS Observability solution.

### AWS Application Load Balancer - Overview

The **AWS Application Load Balancer - Overview** dashboard provides visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups, with at-a-glance views of latency, request and host status, requests from malicious sources, and HTTP backend codes.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor requests to each load balancer to ensure the load is being distributed as desired.
* Quickly identify healthy and unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor trends for load balancers errors, 4xx, and 5xx errors, as well as healthy and unhealthy hosts.
* Monitor the current state across all load balancers via active connections, new connections, target connection errors, and rejected connections.

### 1. AWS Application Load Balancer - Response  Analysis

The **AWS Application Load Balancer - Response Analysis** dashboard
provides insights into how your load balancers are responding to
clients. 

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor incoming client locations for all 5XX, 4XX and 3XX error responses.
* Quickly correlate error responses using load balancer access logs and AWS CloudWatch metrics to determine the possible cause for failures and decide corrective actions.

### 2. AWS Application Load Balancer - Target Group Response Analysis

The **AWS Application Load Balancer - Target Group Response Analysis**
dashboard provides insights into how various target groups are
responding to client requests.

Use this dashboard to:

* Monitor trends of all response codes for your target groups by LoadBalancer, Target Group, and availability zones.
* Correlate response code trends across load balancer access logs and CloudWatch metrics to determine the root cause for failures.
