[Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) is a managed database service, optimized to run in the cloud. The RDS Amazon Web Service (AWS) simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational database instances for use in applications throughout your infrastructure.

The Sumo Logic Amazon RDS app dashboards provide visibility into the performance and operations of your Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Preconfigured dashboards allow you to monitor critical metrics of your RDS instance(s) or cluster(s) including CPU, memory, storage, network transmits and receive throughput, read and write operations, database connection count, disk queue depth, and more. CloudTrail Audit dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure. MySQL Logs dashboards helps you monitor database errors, slow queries, audit sql queries and generic activities.

## Log and metrics types  

The Amazon RDS app uses the following logs and metrics:
* [RDS CloudWatch Instance Level Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-metrics.html#rds-cw-metrics-instance), [RDS CloudWatch Aurora Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMySQL.Monitoring.Metrics.html), and [Amazon CloudWatch metrics for Performance Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Cloudwatch.html).
* [Amazon RDS operations using AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).
* [Publishing RDS CloudWatch Logs, RDS Database logs for Aurora MySQL, RDS MySQL, MariaDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.MySQLDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs.html).
