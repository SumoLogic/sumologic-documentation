---

This section walks you through the process of executing the AWS CloudFormation template to set up the AWS Observability Solution for a **single AWS region and account** combination.

:::note
If you are ready to deploy the solution to multiple AWS regions and accounts, see [Deploy to Multiple Accounts and Regions](deploy-multiple-accounts-regions.md).

Click [here](https://youtu.be/aqngY0lUWUI) to view a microlesson on deploying the AWS Observability Solution with the AWS CloudFormation template. 
:::

## Before you start

If this is the first time you've deployed the AWS Observability Solution, read the [Before You Deploy](../before-you-deploy.md) topic for information about:

* Prerequisites for installing the solution.
* Things you should keep in mind before you run the CloudFormation template.
* Instructions for setting up Sumo Logic Host Metric Sources on your EC2 hosts. 

## Review required inputs

The sections below describe the configuration prompts in the CloudFormation template and the information you need to supply. Before you start filling out the template, it’s a good idea to review each section to make sure you know which sections you want to fill out, and that you have the information you need to proceed.

AWS Observability integrates with Explore by populating metadata and only shows entities with metrics coming in. If you do not see expected entities, make sure configurations are correct to collect and receive metrics. For example, metrics for Lambda functions must be coming in for those entities to show in the Explore view. If you do not see Lambda functions, verify the CloudFormation stack is correctly configured including the AWS/Lambda namespace to collect metrics. 

"AWS Observability Apps-\<Version\> \<Date of installation\>" folder of dashboards by default will be created in the personal library and will be shared with the Sumo org of the user that the Sumo Logic Access keys belong to.

## Step 1: Open the CloudFormation template

1. Sign in to the AWS Management console.
1. Choose an option to invoke AWS CloudFormation Template:
   * Click [this URL](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/quickcreate?templateURL=https://sumologic-appdev-aws-sam-apps.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-observability-versions/v2.7.0/sumologic_observability.master.template.yaml) to invoke the latest Sumo Logic AWS CloudFormation template.
   * Download the AWS Observability Solution template (S3 Link for cloudformation template): https://sumologic-appdev-aws-sam-apps.s3.amazonaws.com/aws-observability-versions/v2.7.0/sumologic_observability.master.template.yaml to invoke the latest Sumo Logic AWS CloudFormation template.<br/>
     :::note
     Download this or other versions of this template from [Change Log](../changelog.md). 
     :::
     :::note
     To change the Collector Name and Source Categories of Sumo Logic sources, you must download CloudFormation template version 2.1.0 or greater and follow the instructions in the (#modify-the-collector-name-and-source-categories) section.
     :::
1. Select the AWS Region where you want to deploy the AWS CloudFormation template.
    :::danger
    This step is critical: if you do not select the correct region, you will deploy the solution in the wrong region.
    :::
1. Proceed to [Step 2](#step-2-sumo-logic-access-configuration), below.

## Step 12: Create stack

1. In **Capabilities and transforms** click each checkbox.

    ![CFT_Capabilities_Transforms.png](/img/observability/CFT_Capabilities_Transforms.png)
1. Click **Create Stack**.
1. Verify that the AWS CloudFormation template has executed successfully in a CREATE_COMPLETE status.  This indicates that all the resources have been created successfully in both Sumo Logic and AWS.
1. If the AWS CloudFormation template has not run successfully, identify and fix any permission errors till the stack completes with a CREATE_COMPLETE status. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for assistance with how to resolve these errors.

## Modify the collector name and source categories

The AWS Observability CloudFormation template creates collector and sources with pre-configured names and source categories. The capability to update the collector name and source categories has been added from version v2.1.0 and above.

:::note
Do not update the source names as created by CloudFormation template in Sumo Logic. Updating the source name will break the FERs and impact the AWS Observability dashboards.
:::

Follow the steps below to change the default collector name and source categories

1. Download the template version 2.1.0 or later from the [change log](../changelog.md) page.

1. Modify the collector name and source categories in the Mapping section of the CloudFormation template.

    ![mappings.png](/img/observability/mappings.png)

1. Deploy the CloudFormation template.

## Troubleshooting

While deploying the template, you may receive error messages such as `CREATE_FAILED` status or `ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` status for various reasons. This section provides information on how to troubleshoot such AWS CloudFormation installation failures.

### Determine the cause of a CloudFormation installation failure

This section walks you through the process of troubleshooting an AWS CloudFormation installation failure.

To debug an AWS CloudFormation installation failure, do the following:

1. After the stack rollback is complete and the status is ROLLBACK_COMPLETE, go to the parent stack. In the parent stack, look for the first failure as shown in the following example. The failure can be a direct reason or can point to a nested stack.

    ![Troubleshooting_1.png](/img/observability/Troubleshooting_1.png)
1. Look for direct reasons for the failure that is available in the parent stack, as shown in the following example.

    ![Troubleshooting_2.png](/img/observability/Troubleshooting_2.png)
1. To find indirect reasons for the failure, go to the nested stack mentioned in the status reason, as shown in the following example. Take a note of the resources mentioned in the reason.

    ![Troubleshooting_3.png](/img/observability/Troubleshooting_3.png)
1. Select the deleted option to find the nested stacks, as shown in the following example.

    ![Troubleshooting_4.png](/img/observability/Troubleshooting_4.png)
1. Go to the nested stack and look for the resource mentioned in the previous step to identify the reason, as shown in the following example.

    ![Troubleshooting_5.png](/img/observability/Troubleshooting_5.png)

### Optimize CloudTrail log ingest

By default, the AWS Observability solution collects AWS CloudTrail logs for all AWS services. To reduce ingestion volume, you can define processing rules that limit log collection to only the logs that are relevant to dashboards provided by the AWS Observability solution.

Define the processing rules for the Sumo Logic AWS CloudTrail Source that was created when you ran the CloudFormation template.

For instructions, see Create a Processing Rule. Create the following rules, selecting Include messages that match as the rule type, using these regular expressions:

```
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticloadbalancing\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"dynamodb\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ec2\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"rds\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"lambda\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"apigateway\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"ecs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventSource\":\"elasticache\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sns\.amazonaws\.com\".*
.*\"eventsource\":\"sqs\.amazonaws\.com\".*
```

### Common errors

Below are some common errors that can occur while using the CloudFormation template. 

| Error | Description | Resolution |
|:--|:--|:--|
| The API rate limit for this user has been exceeded. | This error indicates that AWS CloudFormation execution has exceeded the API rate limit set on the Sumo Logic side. It can occur if you install the AWS CloudFormation template in multiple regions or accounts using the same Access Key and Access ID. | - Re-deploy the deployment stack without updating the stack in the template. Re-running will detect the drift and create remaining resources. <br/> - If the throttling problem persists, try to break down the multi-region deployment into parts and use distinct access IDs and access keys for each part. |
| S3 Bucket already exists. | The error can occur if:<br/>- An S3 bucket with the same name exists in S3, or<br/>- The S3 Bucket is not present in S3 but is referenced by some other AWS CloudFormation stack which created it. | - Remove the S3 bucket from S3 or select “No” in the AWS Cloudformation template for S3 bucket creation. <br/>- Remove the AWS CloudFormation Stack which references the S3 bucket. |
| The S3 bucket you tried to delete is not empty. | The error can occur when deleting the stack with a non-empty S3 bucket. | Delete the S3 bucket manually if you do not need the bucket or its content in the future. |

### Rolling back the AWS Observability Solution

When you roll back the AWS Observability Solution, all the [resources](../resources.md) that were created with the AWS CloudFormation stack are deleted. The resources deleted with a rollback include AWS Observability Solution apps, collectors, sources, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscriptions. 

Rolling back the AWS Observability Solution deletes the main AWS CloudFormation stack, including the nested stack and associated Sumo Logic and AWS resources. The following rollback guidelines apply:

* Sumo Logic resources are deleted based on the “Delete Sumo Logic Resources when the stack is deleted” flag provided during the AWS CloudFormation configuration. These resources include apps, collectors, and sources.
* AWS resources are deleted by default, regardless of the flag provided. These resources include S3 buckets, Lambda functions, IAM roles, bucket policy, SNS topic, and SNS subscription.

To uninstall the AWS Observability Solution:

1. Log in to your AWS account and go to CloudFormation.
1. Select the main stack you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**.
