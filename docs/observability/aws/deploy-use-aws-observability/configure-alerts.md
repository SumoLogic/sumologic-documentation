Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts to help you quickly determine if a particular AWS service is available and performing as expected. These alerts are built based on metrics datasets and have preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations from AWS. These are built for every AWS service that is part of the AWS Observability solution and are installed via installation of CloudFormation template.

Once you have installed the AWS Observability solution with the option to “Install Dashboards and Alerts”, navigate to the AWS Observability folder under **Monitors** to configure them.

To enable the monitors you want to alert on, see [Editing Monitor Settings](/docs/alerts/monitors/settings). To configure alerts to send notifications to other teams or connections, see [Create a Monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor). 

Sumo Logic provides the following out-of-the-box alerts:

| Alert Name | Alert Description | Alert Condition | Recover Condition |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|

| AWS API Gateway - High Latency | This alert fires when we detect that the average latency for a given API Gateway is greater than or equal to one second for 5 minutes. | `>=` 1000 | < 1000 |
| AWS API Gateway - High 4XX Errors | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (\>5%) with a response status of 4xx within an interval of 5 minutes. | `>=` 5 | < 5 |
| AWS API Gateway - High 5XX Errors | This alert fires when there are too many HTTP requests (\>5%) with a response status of 5xx within an interval of 5 minutes. | `>=` 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - High CPU Utilization | This alert fires when we detect that the average CPU utilization for a database is high (\`>=`85%) for an interval of 5 minutes. | `>=` 85 | < 85 |
| Amazon RDS - High Disk Queue Depth | This alert fires when the average disk queue depth for a database is high (\`>=`5) for an interval of 5 minutes. Higher this value, higher will be the number of outstanding I/Os (read/write requests) waiting to access the disk, which will impact the performance of your application. | `>=` 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - High Read Latency | This alert fires when the average read latency of a database within a 5 minutes time interval is high (\`>=`5 seconds). High read latency will affect the performance of your application. | `>=` 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - High Write Latency | This alert fires when the average write latency of a database within a 5 minute interval is high (\`>=`5 seconds) . High write latencies will affect the performance of your application. | `>=` 5 | < 5 |

| AWS DynamoDB - High Account Provisioned Read Capacity | This alert fires when we detect that the average read capacity provisioned for an account for a time interval of 5 minutes is greater than or equal to 80%. High values indicate requests to the database are being throttled, which could further indicate that your application may not be working as intended. | `>=` 80 | < 80 |
| AWS DynamoDB - High Account Provisioned Write Capacity | This alert fires when we detect that the average write capacity provisioned for an account for a time interval of 5 minutes is greater than or equal to 80%.

| AWS DynamoDB - High Max Provisioned Table Read Capacity | This alert fires when we detect that the average percentage of read provisioned capacity used by the highest read provisioned table of an account for a time interval of 5 minutes is greater than or equal to 80%. High values indicate requests to the database are being throttled, which could further indicate that your application may not be working as intended.   | `>=` 80 | < 80 |
| AWS DynamoDB - High Max Provisioned Table Write Capacity | This alert fires when we detect that the average percentage of write provisioned capacity used by the highest write provisioned table of an account for a time interval of 5 minutes is greater than or equal to 80%. High values indicate requests to the database are being throttled, which could further indicate that your application may not be working as intended. | `>=` 80 | < 80 |
