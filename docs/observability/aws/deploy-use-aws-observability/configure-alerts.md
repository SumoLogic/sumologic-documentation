description: Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts to help you quickly determine if a particular AWS service is available and performing as expected.
---

Sumo Logic provides pre-configured alerts designed to promptly assess the availability and performance of specific AWS services. These alerts utilize metric datasets with predefined thresholds aligned with industry best practices and AWS recommendations. They are available for each AWS service integrated into the AWS Observability solution and can be deployed via a CloudFormation template.

After installing the AWS Observability solution and selecting "Install Dashboards and Alerts," you can configure these alerts by navigating to the AWS Observability folder under **Monitors**.

| AWS API Gateway - High Authorizer Errors                                                 | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (&gt;5%)  with authorizer errors within 5 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | &gt; 5             | &lt;&#61;5             |
| AWS API Gateway - High Client-Side Errors                                                | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (&gt;5%) with client-side errors within 5 minutes. <br/><br/>This can indicate an issue in the authorization or client request parameters. It could also mean that a resource was removed or a client is requesting one that doesn't exist. Errors could also be caused by exceeding the configured throttling limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | &gt;&#61;0.05        | &lt; 0.05            |
| AWS API Gateway - High Integration Errors                                                | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (&gt;5%) with integration errors within 5 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | &gt; 5             | &lt;&#61;5             |
| AWS API Gateway - High Integration Latency                                               | This alert fires when we detect the high integration latency for the API requests in a stage within 5 minutes. This alarm is recommended for WebSocket APIs by AWS, and optional for other APIs because they already have separate alarm recommendations for the Latency metric. <br/><br/>You can correlate the IntegrationLatency metric value with the corresponding latency metric of your backend such as the Duration metric for Lambda integrations. This helps you determine whether the API backend is taking more time to process requests from clients due to performance issues or if there is some other overhead from initialization or cold start. | &gt;&#61;2000        | &lt; 2000            |
| AWS API Gateway - High Latency                                                           | This alert fires when we detect the high Latency in a stage within 5 minutes for REST and HTTP API.<br/><br/>Find the IntegrationLatency metric value to check the API backend latency. If the two metrics are mostly aligned, the API backend is the source of higher latency and you should investigate there for issues. View this metric per resource and method and narrow down the source of the latency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | &gt;&#61;2500        | &lt; 2500            |
| AWS API Gateway - High Server-Side Errors                                                | This alert fires where there are too many API requests (&gt;5%) with server-side errors within 5 minutes. <br/><br/>This can be caused by 5xx errors from your integration, permission issues, or other factors preventing successful invocation of the integration, such as the integration being throttled or deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | &gt;&#61;0.05        | &lt; 0.05            |
