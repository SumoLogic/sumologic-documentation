Sumo Logic has provided out-of-the-box alerts to help you quickly determine if a particular AWS service is available and performing as expected. These alerts are built based on metrics datasets and have preset thresholds based on industry best practices and recommendations from AWS. These are built for every AWS service that is part of the AWS Observability solution and are installed via installation of CloudFormation template.

Once you have installed the AWS Observability solution with the option to “Install Dashboards and Alerts”, navigate to the AWS Observability folder under **Monitors** to configure them.

To enable the monitors you want to alert on, see [Editing Monitor Settings](/docs/alerts/monitors/settings). To configure alerts to send notifications to other teams or connections, see [Create a Monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor). 

Sumo Logic provides the following out-of-the-box alerts:

| Alert Name | Alert Description | Alert Condition | Recover Condition |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| AWS API Gateway - High Authorizer Errors | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (>5%)  with authorizer errors within 5 minutes. | > 5 | `<=5` |
| AWS API Gateway - High Client-Side Errors | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (>5%) with client-side errors within 5 minutes. <br/><br/>This can indicate an issue in the authorisation or client request parameters. It could also mean that a resource was removed or a client is requesting one that doesn't exist. Errors could also be caused by exceeding the configured throttling limit. | `>=0.05` | < 0.05 |
| AWS API Gateway - High Integration Errors | This alert fires when there are too many API requests (>5%) with integration errors within 5 minutes. | > 5 | `<=5` |
| AWS API Gateway - High Integration Latency | This alert fires when we detect the high integration latency for the API requests in a stage within 5 minutes. This alarm is recommended for WebSocket APIs by AWS, and optional for other APIs because they already have separate alarm recommendations for the Latency metric. <br/><br/>You can correlate the IntegrationLatency metric value with the corresponding latency metric of your backend such as the Duration metric for Lambda integrations. This helps you determine whether the API backend is taking more time to process requests from clients due to performance issues or if there is some other overhead from initialization or cold start. | `>=2000` | < 2000 |
| AWS API Gateway - High Latency | This alert fires when we detect the high Latency in a stage within 5 minutes for REST and HTTP API.<br/><br/>Find the IntegrationLatency metric value to check the API backend latency. If the two metrics are mostly aligned, the API backend is the source of higher latency and you should investigate there for issues. View this metric per resource and method and narrow down the source of the latency. | `>=2500` | < 2500 |
| AWS API Gateway - High Server-Side Errors | This alert fires where there are too many API requests (>5%) with server-side errors within 5 minutes. <br/><br/>This can be caused by 5xx errors from your integration, permission issues, or other factors preventing successful invocation of the integration, such as the integration being throttled or deleted. | `>=0.05` | < 0.05 |
| AWS API Gateway - High WAF Errors | This alert fires where there are too many API requests (>5%) with WAF errors within 5 minutes. | > 5 | `<=5` |
| AWS API Gateway - High WAF Latency | This alert fires when we detect the high WAF latency for the REST and WebSocket API requests in a stage within 5 minutes. | > 1000 | `<=1000` |
| AWS API Gateway - Low Traffic API | This alert fires where there is low message traffic volume for the API within 5 minutes. <br/><br/>This can indicate an issue with the application calling the API such as using incorrect endpoints. It could also indicate an issue with the configuration or permissions of the API making it unreachable for clients. This alarm is not recommended for APIs that don't expect constant and consistent traffic. | `<=1` | > 1 |
| Amazon RDS - High CPU Utilization | This alert fires when we detect that the average CPU utilization for a database is high (&#62;&#61;85%) for a 5-minute interval. | &#62;&#61; 85 | < 85 |
| Amazon RDS - High Disk Queue Depth | This alert fires when the average disk queue depth for a database is high (&#62;&#61;5) for a 5-minute interval. Higher this value, higher will be the number of outstanding I/Os (read/write requests) waiting to access the disk, which will impact the performance of your application. | &#62;&#61; 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - High Read Latency | This alert fires when the average read latency of a database within a 5 minutes time interval is high (&#62;&#61;5 seconds). High read latency will affect the performance of your application. | &#62;&#61; 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - High Write Latency | This alert fires when the average write latency of a database within a 5 minute interval is high (&#62;&#61;5 seconds) . High write latencies will affect the performance of your application. | &#62;&#61; 5 | < 5 |
| Amazon RDS - Low Burst Balance | This alert fires when we observe a low burst balance (&#60;&#61; 50%) for a given database. A low burst balance indicates you won't be able to scale up as fast for burstable database workloads on gp2 volumes. | &#60;&#61; 50 | > 50 |
| Amazon RDS - Low Aurora Buffer Cache Hit Ratio | This alert fires when the average RDS Aurora buffer cache hit ratio within a 5 minute interval is low (&#60;&#61; 50%). This indicates that a lower percentage of requests were served by the buffer cache, which could further indicate a degradation in application performance. | &#60;&#61; 50 | > 50 |
