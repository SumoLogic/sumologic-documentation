AWS provides over 150 discrete services including compute, network, storage, database, tooling, management, security, developer tools, and analytics to name a few.

Despite all of these services being a part of AWS, troubleshooting across different services can be problematic when you use separate AWS accounts to manage costs and give teams independent administrative control. Different AWS accounts often have different settings across Availability Zones or Regions, which makes it difficult to get a clear picture of overall application health.

The Sumo Logic AWS Observability solution and Root Cause Explorer pull and analyze data across key AWS services and accounts, establish activity baselines, and determine causes for application incidents and high deviation events.

Watch the following micro lesson to learn about our AWS Observability solution.

#### AWS Observability Solution  

The **AWS Observability Solution** can be deployed across multiple accounts and AWS Regions to:

* Minimize the time it takes to get operational insights across your AWS infrastructure.
* Identify elements that are subject to specific operational issues across your AWS infrastructure.
* Minimize the time it takes to assign operational to the correct business units and functional teams in your AWS infrastructure.
* Expedite troubleshooting and root cause isolation for incidents in their apps and microservices running on AWS infrastructure using the Root Cause Explorer.

The unified platform collects and provides logs, metrics, traces, and metadata for the Application, Microservices, Cloud, Orchestrator, and Container layers. The solution understands how the different datasets and services are connected, and stitches those relationships into an entity workflow that makes it more intuitive for users to get a holistic view of their service.

### System architecture and monitoring

Sumo Logic provides an AWS CloudFormation templates (CFN) and Terraform scripts that automate the setup and installation of the AWS Observability Solution for your AWS accounts and regions.

* **Sumo Logic AWS Observability** supports the following AWS services: EC2, ECS, Amazon RDS, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Classic ELB, Application ELB, Network ELB, Amazon SNS, and Amazon SQS.

After you have [prepared](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/before-you-deploy) and [deployed](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability) the solution, you can [add and configure additional AWS services](/docs/observability/aws/other-configurations-tools/add-new-aws-service) as your infrastructure grows.

### Data collection and dashboards

Sumo Logic collects logs, metrics, and events including AWS EC2 Host Metrics, CloudWatch logs and metrics, and CloudTrail logs. The collected data streams are enriched with the following metadata:

* **Account**. This is an alias for your AWS account—for example, production, development, or stage—that you supply when you install the solution.
* **Namespace**. This is the name of the AWS service and is automatically added by either the Host Metrics Source or the AWS Metadata (Tag) Source installed by the template, for example, aws/apigateway, aws/applicationelb, aws/ dynamodb, aws/lambda, aws/rds, and so on.
* **Region**. This is the AWS region, for example, us-east-1, us-west-2, and so on.
* **Entity**. This represents either the AWS resource name or id depending on the AWS service being monitored.

This new metadata can also be used in ad-hoc logs and metrics searches.

You can navigate from overview dashboards of the infrastructure and drill down into account, AWS Region, service, or entity views. The intuitive navigation enables you to quickly resolve issues, minimize downtime, and improve system availability. See [View AWS Observability Solution Dashboards](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/view-dashboards) for details.

### Work with AWS account hierarchies

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) are available to you through your AWS accounts that you can then use for billing and various aspects of your cloud infrastructure. AWS recommends that you use multiple AWS accounts to manage costs across business units and functional teams. In this way, you can provide different levels of administrative control over various AWS resources.

In an AWS account, you can choose resources hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Each AWS Region is a separate geographic area (for example, us-west-2 is in Oregon, USA) and has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. You can provision specified resources (such as databases and load balancers) across multiple Availability Zones, to ensure high availability and failover support.
