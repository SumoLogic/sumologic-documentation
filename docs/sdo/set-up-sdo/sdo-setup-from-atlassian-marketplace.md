description: Learn how to set up the Software Development Optimization (SDO) Solution from the Atlassian Marketplace.
---

These instructions help you prepare and set up the Software Development Optimization (SDO) Solution through the Atlassian Marketplace. 

## Before you begin

Before setting up the SDO solution, you need to complete the following tasks:

* Create or collect API Keys and credentials for Jira, Github, GitLab, Jenkins, Bitbucket, CircleCI, and Opsgenie with Webhook creation capabilities.
* Get access to Jenkins with Manage Plugins permissions.
* Make sure you have access to the Sumo logic console. The user account associated with a Sumo Logic role needs the following permissions:

  * Manage field extraction rules
  * View Fields
  * View field extraction rules
  * Manage Collectors
  * View Collectors
  * Manage Fields
  * Manage connections
  * Manage Content

* Create a Sumo Logic API key and ID  for the above user.

## Install the Software Development Optimization App in Jira

You have two options to install the Jira app:

* Install from Atlassian Marketplace
* Upload and install manually

### Install from Atlassian Marketplace

To install the SDO app in Jira from the Atlassian Marketplace:

1. In the Atlassian console, click **Find new apps** and search for Software Development Optimization.
1. Select the Sumo Logic Software Development Optimization tile and install the app.

### Manually Install by Uploading the App

:::sumo
The following option is for Beta Customers.

To upload the app and install manually:

1. Select the **Manage apps** tab.

  ![sdo-atlassian-manageapps.png](/img/sdo/sdo-atlassian-manageapps.png)

1. If you do not have an upload option, click **Settings** and make sure you have **Enable development mode** checked. With this enabled, you will see **Upload app** link.

  ![sdo-upload-settings.png](/img/sdo/sdo-upload-settings.png)

1. Click **Upload app**.  Enter [https://atlassian-sdo.integration.sumologic.com/atlassian-connect.json](https://atlassian-sdo.integration.sumologic.com/atlassian-connect.json) in app descriptor URL, and click **Upload**.

  ![sdo-upload.png](/img/sdo/sdo-upload.png)

You should see the **Sumo Logic Jira** app installed as show in below screenshot.

## Configure resources using the application setup wizard

The application setup wizard automates the setup of all the necessary resources for collecting Atlassian, GitHub, and Pagerduty product logs and displaying the data in pre-configured intuitive-analytic dashboards. 

* The application setup wizard allows you to quickly get started by installing a copy of the configured applications. After the initial setup, if you need additional copies of the Sumo Logic applications, you can install them from the Sumo Logic App catalog.

* If you plan to integrate Jenkins with this solution, the Jenkins plugin is not configured during setup. To configure Jenkins collection, see [Install the Jenkins Plugin] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md "Collect Logs and Metrics for Jenkins"), [Configure Jenkins Plugin] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md "Collect Logs and Metrics for Jenkins") (use **SDO/Jenkins** as the source category), and [Optional - Advanced Configuration] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md "Collect Logs and Metrics for Jenkins") to install and configure the Jenkins Sumo Logic plugin.

* Currently only Jira Cloud is supported as an issue management application.

The application setup completes the following actions:

* Creates Sumo Logic collection resources including Collector, Sources, and Folder.
* Configures collection mechanisms in the supported tools, for example Webhooks in Pagerduty and GitHub.
* Sets up Sumo Logic Field Extraction Rules (FERs) to enrich the data.
* Configures connections in Sumo Logic to send alerts from Sumo Logic to issue management and incident management platforms including Jira, PagerDuty, and Opsgenie. 
* Installs Sumo Logic Apps in the configured folder.

:::note
You will need the credentials prepared before you began installation and configuration. See [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) prerequisites and details.
:::

To configure using the wizard:

1. Click **Get Started** in the Sumo Logic Jira app.

## Complete Post-Setup Configurations

After setting up the SDO solution, you can complete post-setup configuration.

After completing configuration, instrument your DevOps pipeline to specially identify and send build and deploy events in your pipeline to Sumo Logic. These events are correlated with other events in the DevOps
lifecycle.

Complete the configuration for the build and deploy tool you use.

### Bitbucket for build and deploy

1. Access the Sumo Logic Platform and navigate to **Manage Data** \> **Collection** page.

1. Search for *Software Development Optimization* Collector.

1. Under this Collector, click on **Show URL** for the source **Bitbucket Cloud.** Make a note of this **URL** and use this URL to configure the Bitbucket CI/CD Pipeline to collect deploy events:

   * **Deploy**: Follow the steps outlined in [this document] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Bitbucket/Collect_Logs_for_Bitbucket_App.md) to configure the Bitbucket CI/CD Pipeline to collect deploy events.

### Jenkins for build and deploy

1. Install the latest Jenkins Plugin as described [here] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md)

1. Access the Sumo Logic Platform and navigate to **Manage Data** \> **Collection** page.

1. Search for *Software Development Optimization* Collector.

1. Under this Collector, click on **Show URL** for the source **Jenkins.** Make a note of this **URL** and **Source Category,** you will use these to configure the Jenkins Plugin :
 * **Build Pipeline Stages**: Follow [Configure Jenkins Plugin,] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md) and optionally [Optional - Advance Configuration] (../../../07Sumo-Logic-Apps/app-development/Jenkins/Collect_Logs_and_Metrics_for_Jenkins.md) to configure the Jenkins Sumo Logic plugin.
 * **Build**: Follow [this](../jenkins-plugin-build-deploy-events.md) doc to modify your Jenkins plugin to explicitly identify, enrich, and send Build Events to Sumo Logic.
 * **Deploy**: Follow [this](../jenkins-plugin-build-deploy-events.md) doc to modify your Jenkins plugin to explicitly identify, enrich, and send Deploy Events to Sumo Logic.

If you're using **tools other than Jenkins and Bitbucket pipelines** for Build and Deploy phases:

1. **Build**: Configure your tool to construct and send events using the build event schema in the section Build Event. 

**Deploy**: Configure your tool to construct events using the deploy event schema in the section Deploy Events.

### Access Dashboards from the Atlassian console

With solution installation setup completed, access dashboards in Atlassian:

1. Click **Apps** and select Sumo Logic Dashboard.

  ![sdo-apps-tab.png](/img/sdo/sdo-apps-tab.png)

1. In the new window you should be able to see all the dashboard under **DORA METRICS and DEVOPS LIFECYCLE** section. Click on each of them to view the dashboard.
