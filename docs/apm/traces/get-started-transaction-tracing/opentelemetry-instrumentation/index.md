Looking for our OTEL collector? The [Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector) providesÂ a single unified agent to send Logs, Metrics, Traces, and metadata to Sumo Logic for observability.

OpenTelemetry provides a wide range of ready to use componentry to get you started with distributed tracing. We recommend auto-instrumentation if you prefer not to change application code and are using the following language frameworks:

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

In this section, we'll introduce the following concepts:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
