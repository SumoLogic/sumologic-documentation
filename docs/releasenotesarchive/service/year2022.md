## September 12, 2022 (Alerts)

New - We’re happy to announce the release of Alert Grouping, which allows you to generate more than one alert from a given monitor by specifying a group condition on one or more fields. For example, rather than creating multiple monitors for each `service`, you could create one single monitor that notifies you when some metric (i.e., CPU utilization, error count) goes above the threshold for a given `service`. [Learn more](docs/alerts/monitors/alert-grouping.md).

New - Configurable Resolution Window for Logs allows more quickly resolve alerts when the underlying issues are fixed. You can configure how long a monitor will wait, before resolving the alert, when the underlying issues was corrected (earlier the monitor waited one complete window before resolving). [Learn more](docs/alerts/monitors#Configurable-Resolution-Window-for-Logs).

New - You can now access your monitor playbook as a template variable, `{{playbook}}`. You can reference this template variable to customize your notification payloads similar to any other template variable. [Learn more](docs/alerts/alert-variables.md).

---
## September 9, 2022 (Apps)

New - LambdaTest allows you to analyze your testing behavior and error trends. LambdaTest is a continuous quality testing cloud platform that helps developers and testers ship code faster.

---
## August 3, 2022 (Observability)

New - We're thrilled to announce our new Observability feature, Reliability Management, a foundational capability that helps you define, monitor and manage your modern app stacks to Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Managing SLOs is key to ensuring that modern app stacks are performing reliably for end users. SLOs also help you focus on measuring what matters for their end user’s digital experiences. As a result, they can streamline Observability by minimizing the monitoring and alert chaos that exists in many organizations. Benefits include:

* Simple experience for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) and developers to define and monitor even their most complex SLOs
* Full-featured SLOs that can model any SRE requirement and leverage logs, metrics, and tracing telemetry
* Automation through Terraform, allowing developers and SREs to templatize, operationalize and manage SLOs as code
* SLO data available as log messages enabling customers to extend existing dashboards to feature SLO data or build proprietary dashboard experiences

See our [Reliability Management](/docs/Observability/Reliability-Management-slo) docs for more information.

---
## August 3, 2022 (Traces)

* Enhanced dashboards for [EC2 Host OS Metrics](docs/observability/aws/integrations/aws-ec2-metrics.md), including support for [Amazon EC2 CloudWatch](/docs/observability/aws/integrations/AWS-EC2-Metrics): now you can monitor your EC2 instances via CloudWatch and Installed Collector simultaneously and see results side-by-side.
* Support for [Amazon SNS](/docs/observability/aws/integrations/) - we’ve added out-of-the-box dashboards with the most important information about messages, events, and errors illustrating SNS health and reliability.
* Enhanced dashboards for supported Amazon services - the following services were updated and revamped DynamoDB, API Gateway, RDS, EC2 Metrics, ElastiCache, and All Load Balancers.
* New CLI-based onboarding flow: now, you can roll out a comprehensive AWS monitoring with just a single CLI command by providing your AWS and Sumo credentials.
* Streamlining of Root Cause Explorer drill-downs. While you can still find your AWS anomalies in the RCE screen from the new menu and Entities panel, we have removed RCE dedicated “Events of interests” dashboards from the top-level Dashboards drop-down menu.
* Simplified TerraForm onboarding process by importing Field Extraction Rules (FERs).
* Bug fixes.

---
## July 29, 2022 (Metrics)

New - Our `metricsfromtrace `and `rummetricsfromtrace` metrics have a new metadata tag, `deployment.environment`, which is automatically created from same tag (part of OpenTelemetry specification) present in tracing data. In case the tag is not present in spans, `deployment.environment` is set to default. This tag can be used to build custom dashboards by environments (i.e., prod, staging, test). Support for this field in Explore views and out-of-the-box dashboards is coming soon.

New Audit activity dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure and RDS instance-specific dashboard support for - Aurora and MySQL and Performance Insights dashboards.

---
## 2022-07-04 (Alerts)

Update -  We’re continuing to make [alerts and monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

* **Visually indicate Alerting Query**: For Metrics monitors with multiple query rows, we now visually indicate the alerting query row with a notification bell icon.
* **Improved JSON Validations for Connection Payloads**: We're enforcing stricter JSON validation during creation and updating of Connections to prevent errors that could cause notification failures in the future. There are two major validations that we have started enforcing:
    * If there is a trailing comma (`,`) after the last `"key": "value"` in the JSON Payload structure, we will error out.
    * If there are multiple keys with the same name at the same level within a JSON payload, we will throw an error.
* **Monitor Alerts/Recovery Condition changes**: We no longer support Log Monitors with an Alert threshold condition of “`less than 0`” or “`greater or equal to 0`” . This is because Log queries always result in `0` (when there is no data) or more (when there is data) rows, and monitors that were configured with these conditions were not firing alerts.

New - We are excited to announce support for Span Links is now available in Tracing. You can navigate between spans using hyperlinks in the metadata tab as well as search for spans in the trace query and span analytics areas. Span Links are part of [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/overview.md#links-between-spans) and should be added on the instrumentation side. Links can point to Spans inside a single Trace or across different traces and can represent, for example, batch operations where a span is initiated by multiple initiating spans. For more information, see [View and Investigate Traces.](/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces)

## May 27, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We’re making some architectural changes to the Sumo Logic Metrics Engine to support on-going functionality and scalability improvements. The changes may have some impact on query language semantics for queries that use aggregation or reducer operators.

For aggregation queries, the changes are limited to the metadata used to label the metric dimension in the Preview Table in the Metrics Explorer, and in the chart legend. For queries with reducer functions–`eval`, `filter`, `topk`, `bottomk`–there may be a slight difference in how we quantize the metric data. The engine updates will be rolled out starting on **June 13th, 2022**. For information how the updates might affect existing metrics queries, and how you can update existing queries to avoid any impact, see ​​[Metrics Engine Updates](/docs/metrics/Metric-Queries-Alerts).
