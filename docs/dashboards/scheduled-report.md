The scheduled report feature enables you to receive an emailed copy of a dashboard (PDF or PNG format) at the frequency of your choice, allowing you to get your dashboard insights without logging into the Sumo Logic platform.

You can distribute the dashboard to people in your Sumo Logic organization who do not have access to the platform, enabling better information sharing. It is also useful for compliance management, as it automatically captures and archives the state of the dashboard.

If a .pdf and/or .png export fails, an error email will be sent to your email ID.

## Create a scheduled report

To schedule a dashboard email report, do the following:

1. Navigate to the dashboard for which you want to create a schedule.
1. If the dashboard supports template variables, select values, if desired.
1. Click the kebab menu icon and select **Scheduled Reports**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/scheduled_reports/create_scheduled_report.png')} alt="create_scheduled_report" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="230"/>
  :::info
    The **Scheduled Reports** option appears only if you have edit permissions for the dashboard. You have edit permissions for all dashboards you create, and any dashboards have been [shared](/docs/dashboards/share-dashboard-new/) with you with edit permissions granted.
  :::
1. Enter your preferences in the **Scheduled Reports** popup.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/scheduled_reports/scheduled_report.png')} alt="scheduled_report" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="600"/>
   * **Select report type**. Choose the format in which you would like to see the report (PDF or PNG).
   * **Select variables**. If the dashboard supports template variables, select the values which you need for the scheduled report for the dashboard.
   * **Select Time Range**. Set the time range for the dashboard by selecting a predefined interval from a drop-down list or by choosing a recently used time range.
   * **Select a frequency**. Choose the frequency settings for the scheduled dashboard report: 
      * **Frequency**. Choose the frequency Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.
      * **Every.** The options depend on the Frequency you selected.
         * **Daily.** Choose Every day, Weekdays, or Weekends.
         * **Weekly.** Choose a particular day of the week.
         * **Monthly.** Choose which day of which week of the month you want the report to be sent.
      * **Time.** Choose the time of day you want the dashboard to be sent.
      * **Time Zone.** Choose your time zone.
