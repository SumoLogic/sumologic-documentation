# Set the Time Range in Dashboards

When you set a time range for a dashboard (Last 15 Minutes, Previous Month, and so on), the dashboard automatically recalculates the search and displays the results for that time range.

Dashboard panels are limited to a 32-day maximum time range.

On the dashboards page, select from the dropdown menu at the dashboard level or panel level.

At the dashboard level, the menu includes these options in addition to the time ranges:

* **\[From Panel\]** uses the time range settings from the individual
    panels.
* **\[Revert to defaults\]** returns to the default time range. The
    initial defaults are from the search, determined when you create the
    panel.
* **\[Save as defaults\]** saves the current time range settings as
    the default. This option is available only in Edit mode.

At the panel level, you can set the time range for the panel.
