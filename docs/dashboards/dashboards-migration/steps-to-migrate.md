This document walks you through the entire process of migrating classic dashboards to dashboards.

:::caution
We do not guarantee 100% conversion from classic to dashboard, although we do provide an exhaustive list of incompatibilities that need to be taken care of. You can still keep your old dashboard after migration.

## Migration Steps 

This section explains to you the step-by-step process to migrate your dashboards.

1. Navigate to any of your classic dashboards or create a new one. Click on **Migrate to dashboards**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/migrate-dashboard1.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="dashboard" width="600"/>
2. A dialog box appears. Click **Migrate to Dashboard** as shown below.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/migrate-dashboard2.png')} alt="dashboard" style={{border: '1px solid black'}} width="600"/>
3. Click **Open Dashboard** to view the migrated dashboard, given the migration is successful.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/migrate-dashboard3.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="dashboard" width="600"/> <br/>The following dialog can have 2 other states:
    1. **Warning State.** Showing any warnings during migrations: warnings donâ€™t fail the migration process, however, it might be something that you have to fix on your own or is a feature that is not yet supported on the dashboard.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/migrate-dashboard4.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="dashboard" width="600"/>
    2. **Error State.** The process can sometimes run into an error state, this fails the migration and the dashboard is not created.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/migrate-dashboard5.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="dashboard" width="600"/>

### Bulk Migration

The bulk migration feature is an extension to the dashboard migration feature that allows the user to migrate multiple classic dashboards at once:

1. Go to **Library**, and select two or more **Dashboards**. Click on **Migrate Dashboards**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Bulk+Migration/Screenshot-1.png')} style={{border: '1px solid black'}} alt="dashboard" width="600"/>
