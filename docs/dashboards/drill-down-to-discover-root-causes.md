import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

When you see a spike of interest on a dashboard that requires further investigation, you can easily drill into the related content to discover the root cause. This page shows you how you can easily discover related dashboards and corresponding logs searches that pertain to an issue in your environment.

## Drilling into related content

Sumo Logic provides relevant log searches and dashboards to consider investigating, as well as other locations with relevant content. This facilitates quickly discovering the root cause and devising a plan of action.

Not all error states will provide related content links.

To discover and view related content, do the following:

1. Log in to Sumo Logic and open the Dashboard.
1. Select the graph data point you are interested in. In the following screenshot, we selected a bar in a bar chart. A panel appears on the right of the window with details and a list of related content links.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/details-pane.png')} alt="details pane" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="800" />

## Summary tab

The Summary tab provides details and helpful links based on the selected data point.

### Logs

The Summary tab for log data provides links to other associated logs based on metadata and any [Linked Dashboards](/docs/dashboards/panels/modify-chart).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/logs-detail-pane.png')} alt="logs detail pane" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

### Metrics

A metrics data Summary tab includes links to any [Linked Dashboards](/docs/dashboards/panels/modify-chart).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/metrics-summary-tab.png')} alt="metrics summary tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

## Entities tab

The **Entities** tab provides troubleshooting links for related Entities and Environments, as well as any [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) with a Critical, Warning, or Missing Data status that are tracking logs or metrics on the Entity. The entities are grouped by their domain and by entity type (if there are more than one entity of a given type).<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/entities-tab.png')} alt="entities tab" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="500" />

### Troubleshoot links

To investigate, click the **Open In** button and select an icon to launch another feature against the entity or environment. An icon is not available if it is not a valid launch.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/infrastructure-tab-with-RCE-link.png')} alt="infrastructure tab with RCE link" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />


### Time selector

Use the time selector to set if data is related to the "now" moment of time or the moment of time around the data point you clicked on.

If the **Datapoint** is the same as **Now** the selector will not allow you to select **Now**. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/entities-time-selector.png')} alt="entities time selector" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" /> <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/time-selector-options.png')} alt="time selector options" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

### Triggered monitors

[Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) track your Metrics or Logs data in real time and send notifications when noteworthy changes happen in your production applications. The **Entities** tab shows any Monitors with a Critical, Warning, or Missing Data status that are tracking logs or metrics on the Entity.

Alerts are only visible when the [Time Selector](#time-selector) is set to **Now.**

Next to the Entity, you will see any of the following icons indicating the type of Monitor alert that has triggered.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/monitor-types.png')} alt="monitor types" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="200" />

Click the **Triggered monitors** row to view the related Monitors. You can click on them to view the Monitor on the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) page.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/dashboards-new/drill-root-causes/triggered-monitors.png')} alt="triggered monitors" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="400" />

## Limitations

* Only entity types from a curated list are identified. The AWS, Kubernetes, Traces, Application Components, and Host domains are supported.
* A few Panel types don't support the features documented on this page. You will not have the option to click on a data point to view the Summary and Entities tabs on the following Panel types:
    * [Single Value Panel](/docs/dashboards/panels#single-value-panel)
    * [Map Panel](/docs/dashboards/panels#map-panel)
    * [Text Panel](/docs/dashboards/panels#text-panel)
