title: Single Value Charts
description: Displays the first record of your search results.

You can use single value charts to display results for a search or metric query as a single value, for at-a-glance analysis. This page shows you how to create and tailor single value charts for searches. For information on single value charts for metrics, see [Create and Tailor Single Value Metrics Charts](/docs/metrics/metric-charts).

A single value chart displays a single record from a search, in order to make that value stand out at a glance. If the query returns more than one value in the **Aggregates** tab, only the first value is displayed in the single value chart.

A single value chart is useful for summarizing a time series in a single value. For example, you might want a dashboard panel that shows the number of errors generated by your site over the last 24 hours.

## Create a single value chart

To add a panel with a single value chart:

1. Create or open a Dashboard and click on **Add Panel > Single Value**.

1. Provide a Metrics or Logs query and press **Enter** for it to run.

    **Log query:**

    Enter your aggregate [search query](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators) in the input field and press enter. Only search results that have been aggregated using a group or aggregate operator can be charted. See [Group or Aggregate Operators](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators) for a list. By default, the query builder is set to **Logs**.

    **Metrics query:**

    Click the left-most dropdown option and select **Metrics**. You should be familiar with the basics of creating [metrics queries](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries) to ensure successful results. By default, the query builder is set
    to **Logs**.

    To create a metrics query utilize the [Metrics Query Builder](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer.md).

1. [Modify the chart](./modify-chart.md) as desired.

1. Click the **Add to Dashboard** button on the top right of the window to add the panel to your dashboard.

### Boolean

A boolean single value chart displays a value as true or false. For
example, the following query checks if more than 100 errors are found.

```sql
error | count as MyCount | if (MyCount> 100, true, false) as MyCount
```

The boolean single value chart would look like the following.

## Sparkline

The **Sparkline** option is available for metrics and logs queries. A log query requires your query to have a [timeslice](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/timeslice) operation and you will need to [sort](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/sort) the timeslice as part of the query for the sparkling to render correctly.
