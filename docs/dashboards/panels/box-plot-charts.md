A Box Plot Chart graphically depicts groups of data using quartiles, which are the values that divide a list of numbers into quarters. In Box Plot charts, the bottom and top of the box represent the first and third quartiles; the band inside the box represents the median.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/panels/box-plot-charts/Box-plot.png')} alt="Box-plot" width="800"/>

To create Box Plot Chart panels, your query must include:

* **Smallest value** (sample minimum) using the [min](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators/min-max) or `_min` field name.
* **Lowest quartile** (25%) using the `_pct_25` field name. You can use both **lower** or **ends** with in this part of the query.
* **Median quartile** (50%) using the `_pct_50` field name. You can use both **lower** or **ends** with in this part of the query.
* **Upper quartile** (75%) using the `_pct_75` field name.
* **Largest value** (sample maximum) using the [max](/docs/search/search-query-language/group-aggregate-operators/min-max) or `_max` field name.

For example, this query can be rendered as a Box Plot Chart:

```sql
error | 5 as a | 6 as b | 7 as c | 8 as d | 9 as e | min(a), pct(b,25), pct(c,50), pct(d,75), max(e)
```

Because this query does not meet all the requirements, it can't be
rendered as a Box Plot Chart:

```sql
error | 5 as a | 7 as b | 7 as c | 7 as d | avg(a,b), max(c,d), min(c)
```

The above query is missing the lower, median, and upper quartile values.

If you query contains more than one of a min, lower quartile, median quartile, upper quartile, or max value, the Box Plot will be rendered using the first value encountered.  For example, the box plot rendered for this query would be based on the first `min` value in the query, `min(a)`.

```sql
error | 5 as a | 6 as b | 7 as c | 8 as d | 9 as e | min(a), min (b), pct(b,25), pct(c,50), pct(d,75), max(e)
```

The [Sumo Logic App for Amazon VPC Flow Logs](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/vpc-flow-logs) uses a query that creates a Box Plot Chart. It is:

```sql
_sourceCategory=vpc  
| json "message","logStream","logGroup"
| parse field=message "* * * * * * * * * * * * * *" as version,accountID,interfaceID,src_ip,dest_ip,src_port,dest_port,Protocol,Packets,bytes,StartSample,EndSample,Action,status
| timeslice 1m
| min(Packets), pct(Packets,25), pct(Packets,50), pct(Packets,75), max(Packets) by _timeslice
```

## Create a Box Plot chart:

To add a panel with a box plot chart:
1. Create or open a Dashboard and click on **Add Panel > Time Series or Add Panel > Categorical**.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/panels/box-plot-charts/time-series-or-categorical.png')} alt="time-series-or-categorical" width="600"/>
1. Type a supported query in the Search box, including all of the required field names and press **Enter** for it to run.
1. Once the search results appear, select **Box Plot** from the **Chart Type** dropdown.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/dashboards-new/panels/box-plot-charts/charts_box_plot.png')} alt="charts_box_plot" width="800"/>
1. [Modify the chart](/docs/dashboards/panels/modify-chart) as desired.
