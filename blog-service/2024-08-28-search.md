We're happy to announce a change to the behaviour of the `count` operator to return `Long` values. Previously, the `count` operator returned `Int` data type which could lead to a negative value if the maximum integer value was exceeded. With this change, we are changing the data type of the count operator result from `Int` to `Long` data type.

This change will apply to all new queries. Any existing queries as part of various content types - Log Search, Scheduled Search, [Lookup Table](/docs/search/lookup-tables/manage-update-lookup-tables/#upgrade-the-lookup-table-to-avoid-negative-count-results), [Scheduled Views](/docs/manage/scheduled-views/scheduled-views-best-practices/#upgrade-your-scheduled-views-to-avoid-negative-count-results), and Saved Search will also seamlessly transition to show `Long` values in case of `Int` overflow.
