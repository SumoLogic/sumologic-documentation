New - We've added the ability to tag SLOs, allowing for easier filtering and sorting. when defining SLOs

This is a great way to tag your SLOs with variables such as environment, application, and region.

When you create an SLO, you can add a new tag or select one of your existing tags.

<!--

----
From a new SLO:

1. From SLO tab, click **Add** > **New SLO**.
1. Under **SLO Details** > **Tags (Optional)**, add a new tag or select one of your existing tags.
1. Click Save.

You'll then see your tag(s) populate in the **Tags** column next to your SLO in the list. (screenshot)

If you click **Add a filter** at the top, you're given the option to filter by Tag.

You can also leverage these tags in **Log Search** queries. In this example, we run a query to display all SLOs. You'll see a **Tags** column here.
