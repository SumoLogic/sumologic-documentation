New - The [role capability](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities) we posted about on July 18—**Download Search Results**—is now released. This capability, which grants the permission to download log search results, is enabled for all roles. Note that if you manage role capabilities using the Sumo Logic API or Terraform, you need to add the “downloadSearchResults” capability to the capabilities list for each role that should be able to download search results.
