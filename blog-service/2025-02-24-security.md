Weâ€™re excited to introduce Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence, a powerful feature set that enables Cloud SIEM administrators to seamlessly import threat intelligence indicator files directly into Sumo Logic to aid in security analysis. Threat intelligence indicators are individual data points about threats that are gathered from external sources about various entities such as host names, file hashes, IP addresses, and other known targets for compromise. 

To see threat intelligence indicators, go to **Manage Data > Logs > Threat Intelligence**. Once indicators are ingested and appear on the **Threat Intelligence** tab, Cloud SIEM analysts can use them to search logs for threats using the `hasThreatMatch` Cloud SIEM rules language function.

Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence will help you stay ahead of emerging threats and enhance your security posture.

:::note
Only Cloud SIEM administrators can add threat intelligence indicators to the datastore. However, all Sumo Logic users can run queries against the indicators in our CrowdStrike global feed to uncover threats.
