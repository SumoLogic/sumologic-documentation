Update - We’ve released an update to the [Amazon S3 app](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-s3-audit-source). The key improvement is a new **Threat Intel** dashboard that provides high-level views of threats across your S3 buckets and objects. We also added a new “S3_Bucket” filter to each of the dashboards, so you can slice and dice data by S3 bucket name.
