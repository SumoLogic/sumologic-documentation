We've enhanced the [account page](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/cloud-flex-credits-accounts/#viewing-the-account-information)  to make it easier for you to understand how your credits are being allocated. Wtih **Details of Credit Usage** you can separate out your ingest, storage, and scan credit burn rates as **Promotional Credits** covers any promotional credits you are using with the account. You can also filter your view by day, week, and month or view by time period. And you can download these reports as a PDF.
