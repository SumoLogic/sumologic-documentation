#### Traces

New - we're happy to share extended coverage for [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/real-user-monitoring), our solution that provides insight into your users' end-to-end browser experience interacting with your web apps. New RUM capabilities include:
* New dashboard panels for the following metrics:
   * XHR timing
   * longtask delays (browser freezes)
   * Core Web Vitals KPIs
   * Geolocation
* Single-page app support:
   * Monitoring of XHR calls and navigation/route changes
   * XHR performance and availability metrics
   * New specific Action names for XHR actions ("Click on [button] on [page]") and single-page app navigation/route change actions ("Route to [page]")
* New Explore tree levels for three new action types: document loads, XHR actions and route changes
* Browsers errors (e.g., unhandled errors/rejections, failed resources, console errors) are now captured automatically and populated in the `_index=sumologic_rum_errors` log index and dashboards
   * Browser errors ingest volume is now added to your Continuous tiers budgets and credits consumption.

This new functionality requires RUM script in version 4 or higher (`https://rum.sumologic.com/sumologic-rum-v4.js`). Please ensure you are using the correct version in your pages. For automatic updates, use `https://rum.sumologic.com/sumologic-rum.js`.
