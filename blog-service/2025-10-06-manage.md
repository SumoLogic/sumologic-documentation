We are happy to announce that parent org admins can now configure the users to view and SSO into child organizations. Previously, any user with the **View Organizations** capability could view and SSO into all child orgs. Now, users with the **Manage Organizations** capability can define access on a per-child-org basis, giving you more precise control over who can sign in where. [Learn more](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-and-manage-orgs/manage-org-settings/#manage-and-view-access-to-child-org).
