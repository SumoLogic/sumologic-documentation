Weâ€™re excited to announce the Sumo Logic Security Foundations app, formerly known as the Sumo Logic Security Analytics app. The new app condenses the most powerful features of the previous version of the app into two feature-packed dashboards that not only show you the most important alerts to investigate, but the entities that pose the greatest risk. Here are some of the key features the new app offers: 

* **Alerts analysis**. Get a holistic view into the alerts generated from rules, including the top 10 alerts, alert geolocations, unusual alerts, and alert spikes. 
* **Entity risk assessment**. View the high-risk Entities in your system for a selected time period.
* **MITRE ATT&CK correlation**. See the top 10 alerts, including their [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) tactics and techniques, and the Entities involved. Click an Entity name to drill down to see rules and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques involved in events for that Entity. 

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/security-foundations/) to learn how you can set up and use the Sumo Logic Security Foundations app.
