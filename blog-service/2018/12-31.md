* [base64Encode](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/base64encode) You can now encode ASCII strings to Base64.
* [base64Decode ](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/base64decode)You can now convert base64 strings to ASCII.

---
## July 3, 2018 (Search)

Enhancement-Sumo schedule search email functionality is enhanced!  Now you can use variables that return search results to form the subject line of email alerts. This is great for creating a friendly subject line. For example, you can configure the subject line like this:


```
{{Results.client_ip}} had {{Results.errors}} errors
```

Resulting in a subject line like this:


```
70.69.152.165 had 391 errors
```
