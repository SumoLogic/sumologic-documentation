We are happy to announce that authorized users can now control the visibility of  installed app content. This update allows content administrators and the installing user to configure the roles and users who should be allowed to view the dashboards and log searches that are installed with an app.

For more information about sharing apps, see [Content Sharing in Sumo Logic](/docs/manage/content-sharing/).
