We're excited to announce that you can now delete the ingested data directly from Sumo Logic using **Deletion Requests**. This helps you to quickly remove unintentionally ingested sensitive data without contacting Sumo Logic Support. Deletion requests support multiple datasets, time ranges, customizable filters, and full audit tracking. Also, you can manage the requests programmatically using the [Data Deletion Rules API](/docs/api/data-deletion-rules). [Learn more](/docs/manage/deletion-requests).
