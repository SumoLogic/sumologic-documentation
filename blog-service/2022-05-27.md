Update - We’re making some architectural changes to the Sumo Logic Metrics Engine to support on-going functionality and scalability improvements. The changes may have some impact on query language semantics for queries that use aggregation or reducer operators.

For aggregation queries, the changes are limited to the metadata used to label the metric dimension in the Preview Table in the Metrics Explorer, and in the chart legend. For queries with reducer functions–`eval`, `filter`, `topk`, `bottomk`–there may be a slight difference in how we quantize the metric data. The engine updates will be rolled out starting on **June 13, 2022**. For information how the updates might affect existing metrics queries, and how you can update existing queries to avoid any impact, see ​​[Metrics Engine Updates](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-queries).
