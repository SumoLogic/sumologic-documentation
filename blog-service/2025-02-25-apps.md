We've updated the onboarding experience to give you the option to bypass data collection setup and explore the **App Catalog** instead.

A new **Go to App Catalog** option now appears in the left-hand menu on the data setup page, allowing you to browse integrations and pre-built dashboards before configuring data ingestion. This change makes it easier to explore Sumo Logicâ€™s capabilities without committing to a full setup.

To learn more, check out our [quickstart](/docs/get-started/quickstart) and [signup](/docs/get-started/sign-up/#set-up-data-collection) guides.
