We're excited to announce the beta release of Intellisense for Logs Search. This feature enhances the querying experience with syntax-driven autocompletion, operator prediction, and improved key-value pair support.

Intellisense streamlines query creation, speeds up navigation through large datasets like JSON logs, and reduces errors. The revamped UI provides real-time syntax error detection and intelligent suggestions for a smoother, more intuitive log search experience.

Key features:

* **Syntax-driven autocompletion**. Real-time suggestions reduce errors and accelerate query creation.
* **Enhanced key-value pair support**. Improved parsing and suggestions for structured log data like JSON.
* **Next-operator prediction**. Anticipates the next logical operator, simplifying query writing.
* **Revamped log assist UI**. Updated interface for better usability and query-building efficiency.
* **Facet determination for JSON logs**. Automatically suggests facets for improved filtering and data discovery.

These features are now live in the new code editor, designed to enhance log search efficiency.
