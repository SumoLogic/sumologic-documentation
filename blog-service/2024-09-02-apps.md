We're excited to introduce the new Sophos App for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Sophos source to collect alerts and event logs through the [Sophos Central APIs](https://developer.sophos.com/), providing you with robust security monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/sophos/) to learn how to set up and use the Sophos app for Sumo Logic.
