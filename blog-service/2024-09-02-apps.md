We're excited to announce the release of our new Sophos app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Sophos source to collect the alerts and events logs using the [Sophos Central APIs](https://developer.sophos.com/), thus helping you with robust security monitoring and threat detection capabilities.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/sophos/) to learn how to set up and use the Sophos app for Sumo Logic.
