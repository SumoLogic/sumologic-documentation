We're excited to introduce the new Symantec Endpoint Security Service app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Symantec Endpoint Security source that collects incident and event logs data from the Symantec Endpoint Security platform. This app provides real-time insights into the log data that allows you to monitor and manage endpoint security in real time, enhancing quick responses to threats.
