New - We've added the ability to tag your Service Level Objectives (SLOs), allowing for easier filtering and correlation. This is a great way to associate SLOs with variables such as service, application, and team.

[Learn more](/docs/observability/reliability-management-slo/create-slo) about how to tag new and existing SLOs.
