We’re excited to introduce our new **Searchable Time** timestamp in Log Search, which indicates when ingested logs are fully processed and ready for search. Running queries using this timestamp helps you to eliminate errors caused by ingestion latency and non-linear indexing, ensuring non-overlapping time-range queries return complete results without gaps or duplication.
