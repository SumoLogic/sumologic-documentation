We're excited to announce the general availability of AI-driven alerts for metrics anomalies, extending our AI-driven alerting to metrics-based monitors. This release helps reduce alert fatigue and enables faster incident resolution with automated playbooks.

### Key Features

* **Advanced anomaly detection**. Uses 30 days of historical metrics data to establish baselines and detect critical anomalies.
* **Customizable detection**. Configure detection based on specific criteria, like multiple anomalous data points within a time window.
* **Playbook integration**. Automate responses by linking playbooks to streamline diagnosis and recovery.
