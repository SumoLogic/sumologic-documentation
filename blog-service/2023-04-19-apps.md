New - We're happy to announce the new Sumo Logic App for Akamai DataStream, which allows you to monitor and analyze your Akamai Edge server performance and request-handling pipeline.

This app helps to identify issues that may be impacting your users' experience. This app is tailored to work with Akamai DataStream 2 generated logs, which include valuable information about each request, such as the request path, status code, and response time. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/akamai-datastream).
