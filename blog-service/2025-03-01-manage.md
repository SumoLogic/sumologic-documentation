We are happy to announce that you can now create service accounts in Sumo Logic. Service accounts allow you to create access keys that can be used in scripts or automation. Service accounts are not tied to user accounts, and can be used for authentication needed for system services.

You can use services accounts to provide authentication for operations such as:
* Infrastructure as code (for example, Terraform).
* SCIM user and role management from an identity provider.
* Third party integrations.
