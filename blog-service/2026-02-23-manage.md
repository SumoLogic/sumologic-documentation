We’re excited to introduce our new **Macros** feature, which enables you to define reusable query logic that can be referenced across multiple searches. This approach improves efficiency, promotes consistency, and makes complex queries easier to manage and maintain at scale.

Key features include:

- **Argument-based macros**. Macros accepts arguments to dynamically adjust query behavior at runtime, enabling flexible and context-aware execution.
- **Nested macro support**. Macros can call other macros within their definitions, allowing you to build modular, reusable query components.
- **Improved standardization of search logic**. Macros help centralize commonly used filters, parsing rules, and aggregations, improving maintainability and ensuring consistent query behavior across teams.
