We’re excited to announce that parent org administrators can now centrally manage default and user-specific role assignments for child organizations. This enhancement allows admins to assign custom roles for users accessing child orgs via SSO, reducing over-privileged access, eliminating per-org configuration overhead, and ensuring consistent role assignments across organizations.
