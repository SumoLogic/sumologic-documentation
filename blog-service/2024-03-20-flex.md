We're excited to introduce Sumo Logic Flex Licensing, revolutionizing log analytics pricing for technical teams by eliminating data tiers and aligning the value of log data with generated insights. This groundbreaking solution offers an efficient, centralized log analytics framework capable of managing enterprise-wide cloud-scale log ingestion seamlessly.

Flex pricing offers free, unlimited log ingest. This innovative model is designed to empower developer, security, and operations teams to capture and analyze critical data across their enterprises without worrying about cost barriers.

Consolidating all data streams into a single platform with unlimited user access fosters seamless collaboration across organizations.
