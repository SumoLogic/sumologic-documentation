Update - We've fixed a bug that caused inconsistent results for queries run on the Frequent and Infrequent data tiers due to inconsistent handling of whitespace characters within quoted phrases. With the fix, query results are now consistent across all data tiers.

For more information, see [Normalization of Phrase Queries](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/keyword-search-expressions/#normalization-of-phrase-queries).
