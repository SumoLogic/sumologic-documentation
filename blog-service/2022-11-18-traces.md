Update - Tracing dashboards now offer native support for OpenTelemetry's `deployment.environment` standard tag.

OpenTelemetry `deployment.environment` is a helpful way of slicing APM data between environments (e.g. dev vs prod). Previously, this was supported in tracing metrics as metadata and available for custom queries and dashboards, and now it's supported in our out-of-the-box dashboards as well.

* New Explore view: **APM: Environment View**
* New dashboard elements `...across environments` and `...within environment` show data sliced or filtered for recognized environments
* `environment` added to Entity Inspector as new entity
* `environment` filter added to all drill-down views
* **Application Service View** and **Service Application View** renamed to **APM: Application view** and **APM: Service View**, respectively. Both views now have a hierarchy level with `deployment.environment`.
