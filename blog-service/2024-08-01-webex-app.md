We're excited to announce the release of the new Webex Bronze app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Webex Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/webex-source) to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis of Webex environments, offering real-time visibility into security events, user activities, and system health.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/webex-bronze/) to learn how you can set up and use the Webex Bronze app for Sumo Logic.
