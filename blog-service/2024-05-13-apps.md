We're excited to announce increased visibility into your AWS Cloud environment with the following new features:
* **Out-of-the-box security policy checks**. Sumo Logic Cloud Infrastructure Security is now configured by default to use the out-of-the box policy checks. You can now choose to leverage the out-of-the-box policy checks instead of, or in conjunction with, the policy checks provided by AWS Security Hub.
* **Additional investigation capabilities**. The update includes the addition of three new dashboards:
   * **Infrastructure Overview**. Get deep visibility into your cloud infrastructure to understand how many cloud resources are running and their configurations.
   * **Security Control Failures Overview**. See misconfigurations in your environment that may leave you vulnerable to attackers.
   * **Security Control Failures Investigation**. Navigate and prioritize the most important misconfigurations in your environment.
* **AI-powered remediation plans**. You can now use automated remediation playbooks built specifically for Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS.

This functionality is in preview. To participate, reach out to your Sumo Logic account executive.
