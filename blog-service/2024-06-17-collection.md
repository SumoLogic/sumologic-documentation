We're excited to announce the release of Sumo Logic AWS Lambda Extension version 8. Here are the key features that this upgrade provides:

- Improved the support for AWS KMS encrypted `SUMOLOGIC_HTTP_ENDPOINT`, including the introduction of new `KMS_KEY_ID` and `KMS_CACHE_SECONDS` environment variables.
- Introduced three new environment variables `TELEMETRY_MAX_BYTES`, `TELEMETRY_MAX_ITEMS`, and `TELEMETRY_TIMEOUT_MS`, which helps you to reduce the ingestion delay based on log volume.
- Upgraded Golang to version 1.22 to resolve 20+ security vulnerabilities.
