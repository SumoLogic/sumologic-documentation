Update - We've improved our logic for detecting remote application services.

Even in the most demanding conditions - incomplete or broken traces, intermittent traffic gaps, and other challenges - remote services are detected correctly.

This functionality prevents the creation of remote services for missing spans if there are intermittent instrumentation or collection issues.
