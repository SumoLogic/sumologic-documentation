We're excited to announce that you can use CloudQuery logs with Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS. To use the logs, configure the CloudQuery source when installing Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS.

After installation, you can view information in the following dashboards that are populated with data from the CloudQuery source:
* **Infrastructure Overview**. Get deep visibility into your cloud infrastructure to understand how many cloud resources are running and their configurations.
* **Security Control Failures Overview**. See misconfigurations in your environment that may leave you vulnerable to attackers. 
* **Security Control Failures Investigation**. Navigate and prioritize the most important misconfigurations in your environment.

This functionality is in preview. To participate, reach out to your Sumo Logic Account Executive.
