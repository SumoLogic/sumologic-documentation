We're excited to announce that you can now use CloudQuery data in Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS. 

When you install the CloudQuery source, you can use the following dashboards:
* **Infrastructure Overview**. Get deep visibility into your cloud infrastructure to understand how many cloud resources are running and their configurations.
* **Security Control Failures Overview**. See misconfigurations in your environment that may leave you vulnerable to attackers. 
* **Security Control Failures Investigation**. Navigate and prioritize the most important misconfigurations in your environment.

To participate in the preview, reach out to your Sumo Logic Account Executive.
