#### Observability

New - We’re pleased to announce our new in-product Kubernetes onboarding experience, which guides first-time users step by step through data collection setup (Orchestration, Infrastructure & App Data), the dashboard generation process, and alert monitors installation. To try it out, go to Sumo Logic > **App Catalog** > **Kubernetes** app > then follow the wizard steps. You can also refer to our new [Kubernetes Quickstart](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/observability/kubernetes/Quickstart) doc, which mirrors the in-product onboarding workflow.

#### Collection

New - We’re pleased to announce the release of the [GCP Metrics Source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/gcp-metrics-source). The new source gives you visibility into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure and managed services using an integrated Google Service account. You can collect metrics from 35 native GCP services, as well as from custom services running on GCP.
