### New release

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of new Azure Load Balancer, Azure Cache for Redis, and Doppel Vision apps for Sumo Logic.

- **Azure Load Balancer**. Azure Load Balancer is an Azure service that allows you to evenly distribute incoming network traffic across a group of Azure VMs or instances in a Virtual Machine Scale Set. This integration helps in monitoring inbound and outbound data throughput, outbound flows, and application endpoint's health of your Load Balancers. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-load-balancer/).
- **Azure Cache for Redis**. Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the Redis software. It offers both the Redis open-source (OSS Redis) and a commercial product from Redis Inc. as a managed service. This integration helps in tracking cache performance (miss rate, latency, read and write rate) and monitor resource health incidents and resource usage (CPU, used memory, server load, and connections) of your instances. It also provides policy compliance and recommendations information from Azure advisor. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-cache-for-redis).
- **Doppel Vision**. Doppel technology identifies and takes down deep fakes, malicious impersonations, phishing, disinformation campaigns targeting clients, and utilizes proprietary AI and machine learning tools to automate threat detection and takedowns. The Doppel dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of digital risk protection metrics and alerts, helping users monitor high-severity threats, analyse alerts by various categories, and gain actionable insights.

### Enhancements 

We're excited to announce the release of the updated version of IIS 10 - OpenTelemetry and Azure Webapps apps for Sumo Logic, which includes the below enhancements:

- **IIS 10 - OpenTelemetry**. Five new metrics dashboards are added based on performance, cache counters, and worker process metrics. This app now provides more use cases around application performance, state service sessions, connections, errors, cache memory, requests executing, requests in application queue, pipeline instance count, and output cache. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/web-servers/opentelemetry/iis-10-opentelemetry).
- **Azure Webapps**. Five new logs dashboards and seven new metrics dashboards are added that use activity logs, antivirus scan audit logs, app service platform logs, app service IPSec logs, and platform metrics. This app now provides more use cases around antivirus scan results, tracking of memory usage, insights into the IP address restrictions configured, insights into the network performance, resource health incidents, and insights into the underlying platform performance. It also provides policy compliance and recommendations information from Azure advisor. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/web-apps).
