Archive of June 2022 Service Release Notes.


---
## June 23, 2022 (Alerts)

Update -  We’ve made [alerts and monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

* Customize the alert name to differentiate between multiple alerts created from the same monitor.   
* Choose recovery based on “Single Data point” meeting the recovery threshold or “all data points” meeting the threshold before the alert is resolved.

## June 21, 2022 (Traces)

Update - Traces can now show aggregated trace duration [critical path contribution (CPC) breakdown chart](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces#trace-duration-breakdown-chart) summarized for all traces from the Traces query result set.

Use this chart to:

* Quickly understand intermittent duration spikes or slowdowns
* Immediately spot offending service by comparing CPC contribution by service

## June 15, 2022 (Apps)

New - [Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/Gigamon_ThreatINSIGHT) allows you to stay a step ahead by giving your security teams more: time, data, and insight into attacker behavior. The Gigamon ThreatINSIGHT App for Sumo Logic provides dashboards and visualizes data from ThreatInsight MetaStream files, which helps in identifying potential threats enabling rapid, informed response.

New - The [Gigamon HAWK](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/Gigamon_HAWK) app for Sumo Logic provides deep observability by collecting application context from the network. Its rich metadata attributes extraction offers a holistic picture of what’s happening in the network.

New - The [Lucidum](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/Lucidum) app for Sumo Logic eliminates blind spots across cloud, security, and IT operations. It gives information about assets, data sources, services, locations, risk factors, and ports.

## June 14, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We’re happy to announce a new and improved [Time Series tab](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer#What's_in_the_Time_Series_Table.3F) (previously known as the Preview Table) in the Metrics Explorer. The redesigned table is more compact and easier to read, and you can control which dimensions and data appear in the table using the checkboxes in the pane to the left of the table. When you mouse over a cell in the Time Series table, you can click a three-dot icon to display a context menu that allows you to add dimensions to the query, copy dimensions and values, copy the entire time series, and more. The context menu is supported in both basic and advanced mode. You can export query results in whole or in part to a .csv file.

## June 10, 2022 (Collection)

New - Our [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework) has two new Sources, [Netskope WebTx](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/Netskope-WebTx): The Netskope WebTx API integration ingests Web Transaction logs from Netskope Event Steam and [Box](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework): The Box API integration ingests events from the Get Events API. It securely stores the required authentication, scheduling, and state tracking information.

## June 9, 2022 (Traces)

Beta - Setting up Tracing instrumentation for **Java, Python and NodeJS** applications deployed in Kubernetes just got easier. In a few simple steps with the OpenTelemetry-Operator your application is automatically instrumented and your Traces are sent to Sumo Logic. [Auto instrumentation](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/get-started-transaction-tracing/opentelemetry-instrumentation/kubernetes) for Java, Python and NodeJS applications deployed in Kubernetes is now in Beta.

## June 8, 2022 (Apps)

New - We pleased to announce the availability of the [Carbon Black Cloud](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/security-threat-detection/carbon-black-cloud) App. This app analyzes alert and event data from VMware's Endpoint Standard and Enterprise EDR products and provides comprehensive visibility into the security posture of your endpoints, enabling you to determine the effects of breaches in your environment. The app provides visibility into key endpoint security data with preconfigured dashboards for alerts, threats intelligence, feeds, sensors, alerts, users, hosts, processes, IOCs, devices and network status.

## June 7, 2022 (Manage)

New - Want to upgrade or change your [Cloud Flex Credits Essentials](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/manage-subscription/cloud-flex-credits-accounts) plan? Good news: now you can do it yourself. If you’re a Sumo Logic admin, you can use the **Manage Plan** page to change your plan period from monthly to annual, or from annual to monthly. You can also increase or decrease your account ingest levels and retention settings to meet your evolving requirements.

## June 2, 2022 (Traces)

New - We are excited to announce support for Span Links is now available in Tracing. You can navigate between spans using hyperlinks in the metadata tab as well as search for spans in the trace query and span analytics areas. Span Links are part of [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/overview#links-between-spans) and should be added on the instrumentation side. Links can point to Spans inside a single Trace or across different traces and can represent, for example, batch operations where a span is initiated by multiple initiating spans. For more information, see [View and Investigate Traces.](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces)
