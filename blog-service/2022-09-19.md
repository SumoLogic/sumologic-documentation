#### Security

Update - We've improved out Access Key UI to make it easy to spot Access Keys that haven't been used lately. Now the Access Keys management page displays the date and time an Access Key was last used to make a request to an API endpoint. For more information, see [Access Keys](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/access-keys).

In a future update, Sumo Logic will, by default, automatically disable Access Keys that have not been used for 30 days. Your Sumo Logic admin will be able to configure the period of time before an unused key will be disabled.
