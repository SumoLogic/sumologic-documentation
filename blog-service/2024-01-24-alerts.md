We're happy to announce two new monitoring features that allow you to generate alerts that notify you of suspicious behavior and automatically run playbooks to address it.

### Anomaly detection

You can now use the *Anomaly detection method* when you create a monitor. This method applies advanced analytics techniques, including machine learning and behavioral analytics, to detect anomalies and identify suspicious patterns. It establishes baselines for normal behavior so you receive alerts when deviations or unusual activities are encountered. 

[Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor/#select-monitor-type-and-detection-method).

### Automated playbooks

 An *automated playbook* is a predefined set of actions and conditional statements that run in an automated workflow to respond to an event. For example, suppose that a monitor detects suspicious behavior that could indicate a security problem. When the monitor sends the alert, it could also run an automated playbook to respond to the event.
