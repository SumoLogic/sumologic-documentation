Archive of September 2022 Service Release Notes.


## September 30, 2022

### Traces

Ability to configure monitors with Search Query Language based on Trace Spans index has been officially enabled for all customers. [Learn more](/docs/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/search-query-language-support-for-traces).

Additionally, we now also support:
* [Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches) for Traces
* [Scheduled Views](/docs/manage/scheduled-views) for Traces

### Alerts

Update - We are happy to announce the release of new functionality for Entity Inspector. With the latest update, Entity Inspector will now be able to suggest related Entities from different domains based on your tracing data. This functionality will allow quickly switching context between application and infrastructure domain, making it easier to respond to alerts and investigate issues that require correlating data from both applications and infrastructure. This functionality is available by default to all customers.

### Collection
Update - Good news! We've increased the number of Cloud-to-Cloud Sources that customers with paid Sumo Logic subscriptions can have, from 20 to 50. For users of free accounts, the limit remains 20 Cloud-to-Cloud Sources. For more information, see [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework).

### Metrics
Update - We've updated the release note published on August 30, 2022, which incorrectly stated that the timeslice metrics operator had been released.


## September 27, 2022 (Metrics)

New - We're happy to announce two new metrics operators:

* [ewma](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/ewma)—Computes an exponentially weighted moving average on a stream of metrics. This allows you to smooth out short-term fluctuations (outliers) and display long-term trends.
* [where](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/where)—Allows you to filter data points by value.


## September 27, 2022 (Observability)

Update - We are announcing a minor update of the AWS Observability 2.5.1. This contains changes required due to the end of support for Node.js 12.x in the AWS Lambda as announced [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-the-end-of-support-for-node-js-12-x-in-the-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v3/) by AWS. As part of this update, the Node.js runtime environment for AWS Observability Lambda functions has been updated to 16.x. For more information on updating the AWS Observability to the latest version, see [Update AWS Observability Stack](docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/update-aws-observability-stack.md).


## September 22, 2022 (Collection)

Update - Good news! We've increased the number of Cloud-to-Cloud Sources that customers with paid Sumo Logic subscriptions can have, from 20 to 50. For users of free accounts, the limit remains 20 Cloud-to-Cloud Sources. For more information, see [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/index.md).


## September 22, 2022 (Metrics)
Update - We've updated the release note published on [August 30, 2022](#august-30-2022-metrics), which incorrectly stated that the timeslice metrics operator had been released.


## September 19, 2022 (Security)

Update - We've improved out Access Key UI to make it easy to spot Access Keys that haven't been used lately. Now the Access Keys management page displays the date and time an Access Key was last used to make a request to an API endpoint. For more information, see [Access Keys](docs/manage/security/access-keys.md) .

In a future update, Sumo Logic will, by default, automatically disable Access Keys that have not been used for 30 days. Your Sumo Logic admin will be able to configure the period of time before an unused key will be disabled.  


## September 15, 2022 (Apps)

Update - GitHub Advanced Security dashboards are now available for the Sumo Logic App for GitHub. These new dashbaords include Code Scanning Alerts, Pushes, Secret Scanning Alerts, Security and analyses and Repository Vulnerability alerts.


## September 12, 2022 (Alerts)

New - We’re happy to announce the release of Alert Grouping, which allows you to generate more than one alert from a given monitor by specifying a group condition on one or more fields. For example, rather than creating multiple monitors for each `service`, you could create one single monitor that notifies you when some metric (i.e., CPU utilization, error count) goes above the threshold for a given `service`. [Learn more](docs/alerts/monitors/alert-grouping.md).

New - Configurable Resolution Window for Logs allows more quickly resolve alerts when the underlying issues are fixed. You can configure how long a monitor will wait, before resolving the alert, when the underlying issues was corrected (earlier the monitor waited one complete window before resolving). [Learn more](docs/alerts/monitors#Configurable-Resolution-Window-for-Logs).

New - You can now access your monitor playbook as a template variable, `{{playbook}}`. You can reference this template variable to customize your notification payloads similar to any other template variable. [Learn more](docs/alerts/alert-variables.md).


## September 9, 2022 (Apps)

New - LambdaTest allows you to analyze your testing behavior and error trends. LambdaTest is a continuous quality testing cloud platform that helps developers and testers ship code faster. The [LambdaTest](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/LambdaTest) platform provides secure, scalable, and insightful test orchestration for customers at different points in their DevOps (CI/CD) lifecycle.

New - we’re happy to announce the release of the [Sumo Logic App for AWS Cost Explorer](docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cost-explorer.md), which allows you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

With the Sumo Logic App for AWS Cost Explorer, you can use our out-of-the-box dashboards as well as filtering and grouping capabilities to dive deeper into your cost and usage data and generate custom insights. Gain a better understanding of your cost trends and see detailed information about the costs and usage associated with your top cost-accruing AWS accounts, regions, services, and operations.

Update - We are happy to announce the release of a new Explore Hierarchy for Database [Application Components](docs/observability/app-components.md), together with the support of related Database Entities in Entity Inspector. This functionality allows you to organize your data in a structured hierarchy and utilize the database dashboards available out-of-the-box from App Catalog. Currently, the following Database engines are supported by this feature:

* [Cassandra](docs/integrations/databases/cassandra.md)
* [Couchbase](docs/integrations/databases/couchbase.md)
* [Elasticsearch](docs/integrations/databases/elasticsearch.md)
* [MongoDB](docs/integrations/databases/mongodb.md)
* [MySQL](docs/integrations/databases/mysql.md)
* [PostgreSQL](docs/integrations/databases/postgresql.md)
* [Redis](docs/integrations/databases/redis.md)
* [SQL Server](docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/sql-server.md)
* [MariaDB](docs/integrations/databases/mariadb.md)
* [Memcached](docs/integrations/databases/memcached.md)
* [Oracle](docs/integrations/databases/oracle/index.md)

If you already use one of the above apps, you will need to reinstall it to benefit from the newly added functionality.


## September 8, 2022 (Traces)

New - we're happy to share extended coverage for [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](/docs/apm/real-user-monitoring), our solution that provides insight into your users' end-to-end browser experience interacting with your web apps. New RUM capabilities include:

* New dashboard panels for the following metrics:
   * XHR timing
   * longtask delays (browser freezes)
   * Core Web Vitals KPIs
   * Geolocation
* Single-page app support:
   * Monitoring of XHR calls and navigation/route changes
   * XHR performance and availability metrics
   * New specific Action names for XHR actions ("Click on [button] on [page]") and single-page app navigation/route change actions ("Route to [page]")
* New Explore tree levels for three new action types: document loads, XHR actions and route changes
* Browsers errors (e.g., unhandled errors/rejections, failed resources, console errors) are now captured automatically and populated in the `_index=sumologic_rum_errors` log index and dashboards
   * Browser errors ingest volume is now added to your Continuous tiers budgets and credits consumption.

This new functionality requires RUM script in version 4 or higher (`https://rum.sumologic.com/sumologic-rum-v4.js`). Please ensure you are using the correct version in your pages. For automatic updates, use `https://rum.sumologic.com/sumologic-rum.js`.
