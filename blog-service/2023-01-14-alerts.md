We've rolled out the ability to customizable alert resolution notifications. When setting up Sumo Logic webhook connections, you'll now have the flexibility to design and test both your alert payload and your recovery payload.

Currently supported for: Slack, Microsoft Teams, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, ServiceNow, and generic webhook. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).
