We're happy to announce enhancements to Cloud Infrastructure for AWS. These capabilities were [previously only available in a preview form](/release-notes-service/2024/05/13/apps/). They are now available for general use.

You can now more easily configure sources on a simplified screen, allowing you to use existing sources or create new sources.
