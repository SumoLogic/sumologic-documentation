### Collection
Update - Good news! We've increased the number of Cloud-to-Cloud Sources that customers with paid Sumo Logic subscriptions can have, from 20 to 50. For users of free accounts, the limit remains 20 Cloud-to-Cloud Sources. For more information, see [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework).

#### Metrics
Update - We've updated the release note published on August 30, 2022, which incorrectly stated that the timeslice metrics operator had been released.
