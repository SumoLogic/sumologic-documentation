We're happy to announce **Deletion Requests**, which enables you to remove sensitive or inadvertently ingested data, addressing compliance and security risks caused by misconfigurations, developer errors, or third-party sources.

Key features:

* **User-friendly deletion**. Easily delete data.
* **Multiple datasets and time ranges**. Flexible data management.
* **Customizable filters**. Tailor deletion to your needs.
* **Robust auditing mechanisms**. Ensure thorough tracking.

This feature allows you to independently control and remove sensitive data swiftly and accurately, mitigating compliance issues and potential data exposure without having to contact Sumo Logic support.

:::warning
Deletion requests result in the permanent deletion of data. Once deleted, the data cannot be recovered. Ensure that you have appropriately backed up any necessary data before submitting a deletion request.
:::

To explore these improvements, reach out to your Sumo Logic sales representative for access to the Closed Beta. We look forward to your feedback as we continue to refine our UI.
