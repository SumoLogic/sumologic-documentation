Update - We have renamed our default partition from “Default Continuous Partition” to “sumologic_default”. Now you can directly query the data stored in the default partition, where all data is ingested unless explicitly routed into another partition. Any APIs that reference the default partition by its previous name, “Default Continuous Partition”, should be updated to refer to “sumologic_default” instead. For more information, see [Search the Default Partition](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/run-search-against-partition#Search-the-default-partition).
