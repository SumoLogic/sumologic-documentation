We’re excited to introduce a new dashboard variable type: Scope-Based Variables. Scope-Based Variables act as log filters that can be automatically applied to all or selected panels within a dashboard. This helps you to easily filter data across multiple panels without needing to manually edit each panel’s query to accept the variable. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/filter-template-variables).
