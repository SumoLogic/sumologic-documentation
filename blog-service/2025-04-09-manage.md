We’re excited to announce the general availability of Kickstart Data, a streamlined onboarding experience that includes sample data and prebuilt dashboards. Whether you're starting a free trial or simply spinning up a new account, Kickstart Data makes it easy to understand Sumo Logic's capabilities without needing to ingest your own data first.

* **Instant insights**. Preloaded data and dashboards show platform value right away.
* **No setup required**. Skip config steps like firewalls or security permissions.
* **Easy handoff**. Start using your own data anytime—Kickstart deactivates automatically.
