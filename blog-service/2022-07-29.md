New - Our `metricsfromtrace `and `rummetricsfromtrace` metrics have a new metadata tag, `deployment.environment`, which is automatically created from same tag (part of OpenTelemetry specification) present in tracing data. In case the tag is not present in spans, `deployment.environment` is set to default. This tag can be used to build custom dashboards by environments (i.e., prod, staging, test). Support for this field in Explore views and out-of-the-box dashboards is coming soon.
