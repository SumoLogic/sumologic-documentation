Update - Weâ€™re happy to announce a new and improved [Time Series tab](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer#What's_in_the_Time_Series_Table.3F) (previously known as the Preview Table) in the Metrics Explorer. The redesigned table is more compact and easier to read, and you can control which dimensions and data appear in the table using the checkboxes in the pane to the left of the table. When you mouse over a cell in the Time Series table, you can click a three-dot icon to display a context menu that allows you to add dimensions to the query, copy dimensions and values, copy the entire time series, and more. The context menu is supported in both basic and advanced mode. You can export query results in whole or in part to a .csv file.
