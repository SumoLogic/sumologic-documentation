We are pleased to announce that the [Sumo Logic Lambda Extension](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-lambda-extensions) is updated to support collecting telemetry data using the new [AWS Lambda Telemetry API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api.html). With this update, you can collect telemetry data, including logs, metrics, and traces in JSON format directly from the Lambda execution level. The extension gives a per-invoke level view of the Lambda function and provides insights into the function and execution environment lifecycle. For more information on how to start using it, refer to our [documentation](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-aws-lambda-logs-extension/).
