We're excited to announce the release of the new Mimecast app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Mimecast source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/mimecast-source/) to leverage advanced security monitoring and analytics capabilities for Mimecast data. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Email Traffic Monitoring**. Monitor message traffic for both delivered and received emails with a detailed overview of each stage.
- **Threat Detection Monitoring**. Monitor logs regarding messages with malicious attachments, user activity, and threat detection within the orgaization users.
- **Data Loss Monitoring**. Monitor data loss resulting from breaches and malicious attacks.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/mimecast/) to learn how you can set up and use the Mimecast app for Sumo Logic.
