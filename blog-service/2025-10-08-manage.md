We’re excited to announce the new **Organization Usage Limits** tab, featuring the **Ingestion – Throttling Limits** section. This section displays your average ingestion rate for a selected time range alongside your account’s throttling limits. Additionally, you can opt in to receive email notifications whenever your account experiences throttling. [Learn more](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/organization-usage-limits).
