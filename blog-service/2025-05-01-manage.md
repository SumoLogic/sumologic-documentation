We are happy to announce that you can now create service accounts in Sumo Logic. Service accounts are a special type of account designed for automating processes that use Sumo Logic APIs, such as scripts, integrations, and infrastructure as code. Unlike user accounts, service accounts are not associated with an individual and do not allow for interactive logins.

[Learn more](/docs/manage/security/service-accounts).
