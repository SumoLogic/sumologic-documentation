#### Metrics

New - We're happy to announce two new metrics operators:

* [ewma](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/ewma)—Computes an exponentially weighted moving average on a stream of metrics. This allows you to smooth out short-term fluctuations (outliers) and display long-term trends.
* [where](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/where)—Allows you to filter data points by value.

#### Observability

Update - We are announcing a minor update of the AWS Observability 2.5.1. This contains changes required due to the end of support for Node.js 12.x in the AWS Lambda as announced [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-the-end-of-support-for-node-js-12-x-in-the-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v3/) by AWS. As part of this update, the Node.js runtime environment for AWS Observability Lambda functions has been updated to 16.x. For more information on updating the AWS Observability to the latest version, see [Update AWS Observability Stack](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/update-aws-observability-stack).
