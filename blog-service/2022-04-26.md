#### Collection

New - Our [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework) has a new Source. The [Dropbox Source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/dropbox-source) provides a secure endpoint to receive team events from the [Get Events API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams#team_log-get_events).

Update - The [Tenable Source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/tenable-source) now supports collecting [audit logs](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/audit-log-events) from the Audit Log API and [assets](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/exports-assets-request-export) from the Asset Export API. We've also added the ability to define Processing Rules.

#### Traces

New - You can now add the results of Spans queries directly to Dashboards from the [Spans analytics](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/spans#Add-to-Dashboard) window. You'll use the same easy query builder to [modify your panels](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/dashboards-new/panels/modify-chart) later. You can still use [Log Search](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/search-query-language-support-for-traces) to add span results to Dashboards by running queries in the `_trace_spans` index. The same limitations of Log Search still apply, your query scan volume should not exceed 200x of your tracing ingest.
