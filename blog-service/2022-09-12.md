#### Alerts

New - Weâ€™re happy to announce the release of Alert Grouping, which allows you to generate more than one alert from a given monitor by specifying a group condition on one or more fields. For example, rather than creating multiple monitors for each `service`, you could create one single monitor that notifies you when some metric (i.e., CPU utilization, error count) goes above the threshold for a given `service`. [Learn more](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-grouping).

New - Configurable Resolution Window for Logs allows more quickly resolve alerts when the underlying issues are fixed. You can configure how long a monitor will wait, before resolving the alert, when the underlying issues was corrected (earlier the monitor waited one complete window before resolving). [Learn more](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors#Configurable-Resolution-Window-for-Logs).

New - You can now access your monitor playbook as a template variable, `{{playbook}}`. You can reference this template variable to customize your notification payloads similar to any other template variable. [Learn more](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/alert-variables).
