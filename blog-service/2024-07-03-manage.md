We are excited to introduce a new and enhanced credits management experience for our Sumo Logic orgs customers. This update empowers Sumo Logic parent org admins to manage child org credits with greater ease and control. Here are the key improvements in this update:

- **Flexible Allocation**. Parent org admins can now allocate and manage credits for child orgs more flexibly, with faster and fewer steps.
- **Smart Recommendations**. Receive system-suggested credit allocations tailored to your needs.
- **Effortless Top-Ups**. Seamlessly top-up credits for child orgs upon depletion without needing baseline adjustments.
