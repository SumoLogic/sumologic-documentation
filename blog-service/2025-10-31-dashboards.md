Weâ€™re excited to introduce **Conditional** thresholds to table charts in dashboards, helping you to quickly surface trends, outliers, and key indicators to enhance data readability at a glance. This feature allows you to apply flexible color rules to rows and cells, making it easy to highlight values that breach defined thresholds.
