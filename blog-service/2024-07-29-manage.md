We're excited to announce that when you create a role, you can select **Index Access** to restrict access to data in specific indexes. In addition, when you now select **Search Filter**, you can create filtering to restrict access to log analytics, audit, and security data. These enhancements ensure that users only see the data they are supposed to. 

This feature was [previously only available to participants in our beta program](/release-notes-service/2023/10/27/manage/). It is now available for general use.
