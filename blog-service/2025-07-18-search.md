We’re excited to announce the release of **Query Assist**, designed to simplify query building by reducing complexity, enabling easier field discovery, minimizing errors, and providing intelligent query-writing assistance. These enhancements deliver real-time syntax suggestions, schema-based recommendations, and a frictionless query experience.

Key features of this feature include:

* **Real-time syntax suggestions**. Get instant recommendations for syntax and operators to accelerate query creation and reduce errors.
* **Schema-based field suggestions.** Automatically discover relevant keys and fields for structured data like JSON logs.
* **Partial query prediction.** Anticipate the next operator or receive partial query suggestions based on your input.
* **Enhanced user experience.** Real-time error highlighting and intelligent suggestions provide a smooth and seamless query-building process.

These updates make it easier for both beginners and advanced users to craft accurate queries and analyze data efficiently. [Learn more](/docs/search/query-assist/).
