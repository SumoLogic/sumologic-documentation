We're excited to introduce an improved approach to calculating and aggregating percentiles on APM dashboards. This new mechanism significantly improves the accuracy of measurements for all APM percentile metrics and is now available in all dashboards.

What's New?
* All APM metrics on dashboards now use the recently released [Metrics Histograms](/docs/metrics/introduction/metric-histograms/).
* The Service List panel replaces the existing timeseries table in the Application Details panel and is now included in out-of-the-box dashboards for APM views in the **Explore** tab. This change leverages the new and useful visualization for [Services List](/docs/apm/traces/services-list-map/#services-list-view) released earlier.
* The top bar selector for latency type has been renamed to `latency_type`, which now automatically drives all latency percentile metrics in all panels that support pct metrics.
