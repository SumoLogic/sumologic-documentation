We're excited to announce the availability of the Closed Beta version of our updated Sumo Logic User Interface (UI). This release brings several enhancements aimed at improving your overall experience:

* **Unified Navigation**. Seamlessly access all Observability features (e.g., Alerts, Log Search, APM, Metrics) alongside Security features (e.g., Cloud SIEM, Cloud SOAR) from a single, unified left-navigation menu. This is a significant improvement over our legacy Classic UI, where users had to navigate away from Sumo Logic when using Cloud SIEM or SOAR.
* **Streamlined Administration**. Administrative functions, Data Configuration, Help, and User Preferences have been relocated to the top toolbar menu for simplified access.
* **Enhanced Browsing Experience**. Now, instead of in-app tabs, you can utilize native browser tabs for a more familiar browsing experience, complete with session history, the back button, favorites, and other native browser capabilities.
* **Improved Performance**. With a simplified UI, you'll experience accelerated performance, enhanced usability, and a consistently smooth browsing experience, empowering you to troubleshoot incidents faster. We've achieved significant improvements in two primary metrics:
   * **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**. ~90% improvement (synthetic), 75% improvement (RUM).
   * **Time to Interactivity (TTI)**. ~27% improvement (synthetic), 50% improvement (RUM).
* **Stateful URLs**. URLs now reflect real-time changes. Any modifications you make within the UI are instantly reflected in the URL parameters, ensuring effortless sharing of the most up-to-date content with collaborators.
