Weâ€™ve made multiple updates to the [Search Results Table](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-page/navigate-through-search-results) to improve the user experience for viewing search results. The enhancements include:

* The ability to pin columns of interest.
* New setting to increase line height for messages.
* New table level options to expand and collapse messages.
* Context menu option to expand nested JSON.
