Update - For Enterprise Suite customers, weâ€™ve doubled the number of [Fields](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/Fields) you can create. The per account Fields limit is now 400. The limit applies to Fields that you configure for sources or collectors and those you create using [Field Extraction Rules](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/Field-Extractions).
