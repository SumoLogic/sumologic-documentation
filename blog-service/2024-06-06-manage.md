We are happy to announce a new **Disallow weak passwords** option in our password policy settings. When this option is enabled, users will not be able to save a password if Sumo Logic determines it is weak. For example, a password is considered weak if it is:
       * Obtained from previous breaches.
       * A dictionary word.
       * Contains repetitive or sequential characters, for example, ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’.
       * Contains context-specific words, such as the name of the service or the username.
