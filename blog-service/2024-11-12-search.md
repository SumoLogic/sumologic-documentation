We're happy to announce a change in the computation for the `scanned_partition_count` Search Audit Index field. Previously, we were using incorrect computation to calculate the value for the `scanned_partition_count` field. With this change, the incorrect computation is fixed and now you will obtain the correct number of partitions scanned for the respective search.
