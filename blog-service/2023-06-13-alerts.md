New - we're happy to announce the release of **Muting Schedules**, a new feature that allows you to pause monitor notifications according to a schedule that you define. You can apply this setting to individual monitors and/or folders. For folders, this will mute all nested monitors and subfolders.

Some scenarios where you might want to mute your monitor notifications include your org's scheduled system maintenance and off-business hours activity. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/muting-schedules).
