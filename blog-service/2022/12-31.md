## December 29, 2022 (Real User Monitoring)

New - We've added a new Real User Monitoring script property, `getOverriddenServiceName`, that allows you to set up a service name dynamically and override the service name of a span during its creation.

You can use `getOverriddenServiceName` to create different services for different sub-parts of your website. For example, you could create unique service names for micro-frontends. [Learn more](/docs/apm/real-user-monitoring/#step-1-create-a-rum-http-traces-source).

---
## December 22, 2022 (CircleCI Job Analytics)

New - You can now report CircleCI job analytics to your Sumo Logic dashboard using our new job-collector command, which sends environment, team, and service information at the job level.

Add this command to your job with the environment, team, or service custom-data values as parameters. This command will run with the rest of the job's commands for sending the job log.

:::note
Not including this command at the job level will send empty custom-data values to Sumo.
:::

To learn more, refer to the [Sumo Logic orb repo](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-orb#job-collector).

---
## December 14, 2022 (Traces)

New - Trace duration breakdown chart dashboard support is now available.

On the Trace page, you can now add the trace duration breakdown chart to the dashboard. Use the Traces panel and change the chart type to "Breakdown Chart" in the dropdown of Visual settings.

---
## December 5, 2022 (Metrics)

New - We’ve released a new chart type for metrics queries. The funnel chart is useful for visualizing the status of a process with sequential steps. For more information, see [Create a Funnel Chart](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/funnel-chart/).

---
## December 2, 2022 (Reliability Management)

New - AWS ELB users can now install Sumo Logic out-of-the-box SLOs and associated monitors using [our new Terraform script](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-solution-templates/tree/master/slo_packages/aws).

This script allows you to install Sumo Logic SLOs in your specified AWS ELB directory and configure SLO alert notifications (e.g., latency limit breached, server error limit breached). Once installed, you can view and edit your SLO alerts via Terraform or from your Sumo Logic **Monitors** page.

To learn more about our SLOs, see [Sumo Logic Reliability management](/docs/observability/reliability-management-slo).

---
## December 2, 2022 (Manage)

Update - On November 10, we released improvements to the **Account Overview** page. Now, an admin for a parent org can see  detailed usage of Sumo Credits for different product variables, aggregated across child orgs from the start of the contract period. Another nice enhancement: the **Account Overview** page now also presents Promotional Credits consumption. For more information, see [Create and Manage Orgs](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-manage-orgs/#monitor-credits-quota-and-usage).

---
# December 1, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - As of December 1, 2022, metrics ingested to Sumo Logic must include the `metric` dimension.

If you send metrics without the `metric` dimension, Sumo Logic will ingest them, and set the `metric` dimension value to *undefined*. We plan to deprecate and filter these metrics at a later date.

There are benefits to including the `metric` dimension: it improves the structure of queries, dashboards, and monitors. In addition, the presence of the `metric` dimension can significantly improve query latency and monitor evaluation time.

For more information, see [Mandatory metric name](/docs/metrics/introduction/metric-formats/#mandatory-metric-name).

---
## November 30, 2022 (Metrics)

New - We're pleased to announce a new chart type for metric queries. A heat map visualizes the count of data points returned by a metrics query within specified value ranges over time intervals of a specified duration. For more information, see [Create a Heat Map](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/heat-map/).

---
## November 29, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - Good news! We've increased the number of Metrics Monitors that Enterprise and Trial accounts can have, from 500 to 1,500. For more information, see [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/#rules).

---
## November 28, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We've updated the logic used to calculate input data limits for metrics queries. This new method enables higher cardinality limits for time series inputs to metric queries. For more information, see [Metrics Query Error Messages](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metric-query-error-messages/#input-data-limit).

---
## November 22, 2022 (Apps)

Update - We are pleased to announce that the [Sumo Logic Lambda Extension](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-lambda-extensions) has been updated to support collecting telemetry data using the new [AWS Lambda Telemetry API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/telemetry-api.html). With this update, you can collect telemetry data, including logs, metrics, and traces in JSON format directly from the Lambda execution level. The extension gives a per-invoke level view of the Lambda function and provides insights into the function and execution environment lifecycle. For more information on how to start using it, refer to our [documentation](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-aws-lambda-logs-extension/).

---
## November 21, 2022 (Alerts)

New - We’ve rolled out a feature that allows you to customize your Alert list page to display (by default) only the alerts that you care about, rather than showing all the open alerts within your organization.

You can do this by going to your [Monitors page](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-response/#from-your-monitors-list) or [Alerts page](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-response/#from-your-alerts-list) and subscribing to the specific monitors you'd like to follow.

With this release, we've also updated our [Alert notification preferences](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-response/#notification-preferences) to give you more granular control over specific monitor activity you want to follow.

---
## November 18, 2022 (Traces)

Update - Tracing dashboards now offer native support for OpenTelemetry's `deployment.environment` standard tag.

OpenTelemetry `deployment.environment` is a helpful way of slicing APM data between environments (e.g. dev vs prod). Previously, this was supported in tracing metrics as metadata and available for custom queries and dashboards, and now it's supported in our out-of-the-box dashboards as well.

* New Explore view: **APM: Environment View**
* New dashboard elements `...across environments` and `...within environment` show data sliced or filtered for recognized environments
* `environment` added to Entity Inspector as new entity
* `environment` filter added to all drill-down views
* **Application Service View** and **Service Application View** renamed to **APM: Application view** and **APM: Service View**, respectively. Both views now have a hierarchy level with `deployment.environment`.

Learn more:
* [Working with Tracing Dashboards](/docs/apm/traces/tracing-dashboards)
* [Explore View](/docs/dashboards-new/explore-view)

---
## November 15, 2022 (Traces)

New - We've released an OpenTelemetry Kubernetes Operator for tracing instrumentation. When you enable and install this operator, your application is instrumented automatically and traces will be sent to Sumo Logic. [Learn more](/docs/apm/traces/get-started-transaction-tracing/opentelemetry-instrumentation/kubernetes).

---
## October 27, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We’ve enhanced the [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer/) to make metric query results easier to interpret. Now, you can define Warning and Critical threshold values for query results. When you do that, your chart view will be color-coded so you can easily spot out-of-threshold behavior. For more information, see [Set Warning and Critical Thresholds](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer/#set-warning-and-critical-thresholds).

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/fill-green.png')} alt="thresholds-icon.png"/>

* [where](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/where)—Allows you to filter data points by value.

---
## September 27, 2022 (Observability)

Update - We are announcing a minor update of the AWS Observability 2.5.1. This contains changes required due to the end of support for Node.js 12.x in the AWS Lambda as announced [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-the-end-of-support-for-node-js-12-x-in-the-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v3/) by AWS. As part of this update, the Node.js runtime environment for AWS Observability Lambda functions has been updated to 16.x. For more information on updating the AWS Observability to the latest version, see [Update AWS Observability Stack](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/update-aws-observability-stack).

---
## September 19, 2022 (Manage)

Update - We've improved out Access Key UI to make it easy to spot Access Keys that haven't been used lately. Now the Access Keys management page displays the date and time an Access Key was last used to make a request to an API endpoint. For more information, see [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys).

In a future update, Sumo Logic will, by default, automatically disable Access Keys that have not been used for 30 days. Your Sumo Logic admin will be able to configure the period of time before an unused key will be disabled.

---
## September 15, 2022 (Apps)

Update - GitHub Advanced Security dashboards are now available for the Sumo Logic App for GitHub. These new dashboards include Code Scanning Alerts, Pushes, Secret Scanning Alerts, Security and analyzes and Repository Vulnerability alerts.

---
## September 12, 2022 (Alerts)

New - We’re happy to announce the release of Alert Grouping, which allows you to generate more than one alert from a given monitor by specifying a group condition on one or more fields. For example, rather than creating multiple monitors for each `service`, you could create one single monitor that notifies you when some metric (i.e., CPU utilization, error count) goes above the threshold for a given `service`. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-grouping).

New - Configurable Resolution Window for Logs allows more quickly resolve alerts when the underlying issues are fixed. You can configure how long a monitor will wait, before resolving the alert, when the underlying issues was corrected (earlier the monitor waited one complete window before resolving). [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors#configurable-resolution-window).

New - You can now access your monitor playbook as a template variable, `{{playbook}}`. You can reference this template variable to customize your notification payloads similar to any other template variable. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-variables).

---
## September 9, 2022 (Apps)

New - LambdaTest allows you to analyze your testing behavior and error trends. LambdaTest is a continuous quality testing cloud platform that helps developers and testers ship code faster.

Preconfigured dashboards allow you to monitor critical metrics of your RDS cluster, including CPU, memory, storage, the network transmits and receive throughput, read and write operations, database connection count, disk queue depth, and more. Audit activity dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure. This app updates from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all the dashboards to Dashboards(New). New Audit activity dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure and RDS instance-specific dashboard support for - Aurora and MySQL and Performance Insights dashboards.

Update - Sumo Logic and AWS are excited to announce an update to [Sumo Logic Integrations for AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sumo-logic-for-aws-organizations/). This solution allows joint customers of AWS and Sumo Logic to automate the integration of [AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/architecture.html)-compliant organizations with [Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM powered by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-o622lpl6biu6s).

## July 4, 2022 (Alerts)

Update -  We’re continuing to make [alerts and monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

* **Visually indicate Alerting Query**: For Metrics monitors with multiple query rows, we now visually indicate the alerting query row with a notification bell icon.
* **Improved JSON Validations for Connection Payloads**: We're enforcing stricter JSON validation during creation and updating of Connections to prevent errors that could cause notification failures in the future. There are two major validations that we have started enforcing:
    * If there is a trailing comma (`,`) after the last `"key": "value"` in the JSON Payload structure, we will error out.
    * If there are multiple keys with the same name at the same level within a JSON payload, we will throw an error.
* **Monitor Alerts/Recovery Condition changes**: We no longer support Log Monitors with an Alert threshold condition of “`less than 0`” or “`greater or equal to 0`” . This is because Log queries always result in `0` (when there is no data) or more (when there is data) rows, and monitors that were configured with these conditions were not firing alerts.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/service/metrics-monitor-query-row.png')} alt="metrics-monitor-query-row"/>

---
## June 23, 2022 (Alerts)

Update -  We’ve made [alerts and monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

For more information, see [View and Investigate Traces.](/docs/apm/traces/view-and-investigate-traces)

---
## May 27, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We’re making some architectural changes to the Sumo Logic Metrics Engine to support on-going functionality and scalability improvements. The changes may have some impact on query language semantics for queries that use aggregation or reducer operators.

For aggregation queries, the changes are limited to the metadata used to label the metric dimension in the Preview Table in the Metrics Explorer, and in the chart legend. For queries with reducer functions–`eval`, `filter`, `topk`, `bottomk`–there may be a slight difference in how we quantize the metric data. The engine updates will be rolled out starting on **June 13, 2022**. For information how the updates might affect existing metrics queries, and how you can update existing queries to avoid any impact, see ​​[Metrics Engine Updates](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries).
