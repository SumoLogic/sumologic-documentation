New - We're excited to announce a new milestone in innovation for Sumo Logic Observability with the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Distro Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) (OT Distro).

The OT Distro Collector is designed to simplify and democratize the collection of logs, metrics, traces, and metadata from modern cloud applications. With this announcement, Sumo Logic further embraces open source and establishes OpenTelemetry as its future standard to collect all machine data, breaking from the legacy model of using proprietary agents to gather critical application and infrastructure telemetry.
