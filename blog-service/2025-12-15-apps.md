As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Sumo Logic service, our product team will be deprecating GIS for Apache, GIS for Apache Tomcat, and GIS for NGINX Apps, which will no longer be available as of 19 Jan 2026.

## Why is this happening?

* We identified an opportunity to increase efficiency in under-utilized areas and focus on new high-value areas, including Agentic AI capabilities.

## What is happening?

After the end-of-life date of GIS for Apache, GIS for Apache Tomcat, and GIS for NGINX Apps on 19 Jan 2026, the apps are no longer available both as an independent operation from the main Sumo Logic page and these apps will no longer be available in the App Catalog.

## What do I need to do?

There are no specific preparations or actions that customers need to take as a result of this deprecation and end-of-life. As of the end-of-life date, GIS for Apache, GIS for Apache Tomcat, and GIS for NGINX Apps will no longer be available in  Sumo Logic. The deprecation of these GIS apps will not have any effect on other existing features and functions that customers may be using.

For any additional questions, please reach out to your Sumo Logic Account team or [open a support ticket](https://support.sumologic.com/support/s/) with our Customer Support Team.
