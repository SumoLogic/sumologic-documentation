As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Sumo Logic service, our product team will be deprecating the Global Intelligence for Apache, Global Intelligence for Apache Tomcat, and Global Intelligence for Nginx apps. These apps will no longer be available as of 19 January 2026.

## Why is this happening?

We identified an opportunity to increase efficiency in under-utilized areas and focus on new high-value areas, including Agentic AI capabilities.

## What is happening?

After the end-of-life date of 19 January 2026, the Global Intelligence for Apache, Global Intelligence for Apache Tomcat, and Global Intelligence for Nginx apps will no longer be accessible as standalone operations from the main Sumo Logic page and will be removed from the App Catalog.

## What do I need to do?

There are no specific preparations or actions that you need to take as a result of this deprecation and end-of-life. As of the end-of-life date, the Global Intelligence for Apache, Global Intelligence for Apache Tomcat, and Global Intelligence for NGINX apps will no longer be available in Sumo Logic. This change will not impact any other existing features or functionality that you may be using.
