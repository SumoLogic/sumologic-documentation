We are excited to announce that we are now supporting Sumo Logic's Organizations ("Sumo Orgs") feature for Sumo Logic Flex customers. With this release, Flex customers can effectively group, provision, manage, and monitor the credit usage across multiple organizations, providing greater visibility and control over account structures.
