Update - Previously, for Sumo Logic customers on POV **Trial** plans, their accounts would be downgraded automatically to our **Free** plan at the end of their 45-day trial period. Effective today, these customers will be notified about their trial period expiration date in two different places in the UI: **View details for the selected organizations** and **Child org table**.
