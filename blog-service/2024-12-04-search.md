We are happy to announce the behavioural change for the `compareCIDRPrefix` and `getCIDRPrefix` operators. Previously, these operators would fail if there were trailing or leading spaces around the IP address. With this update, the `compareCIDRPrefix` and `getCIDRPrefix` operators have become more flexible and can do trimming, which means the operators will not fail even if there are trailing or leading spaces around the IP address.
