We are happy to announce the behavioural change for the [`compareCIDRPrefix`](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/cidr/#comparecidrprefix) and [`getCIDRPrefix`](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/cidr/#getcidrprefix) operators. Previously, these operators would fail if there were trailing or leading spaces around the IP address. With this update, the `compareCIDRPrefix` and `getCIDRPrefix` operators have become more flexible and can do trimming, which means the operators will not fail even if there are trailing or leading spaces around the IP address.
