We're excited to announce the general availability of AI-driven alerts for metrics anomalies, extending our AI-driven alerting capabilities to include metrics-based monitors. This new feature aims to reduce alert fatigue and accelerate incident resolution through the use of automated playbooks. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor).

### Key features

* **Advanced anomaly detection**. Leverages 30 days of historical metrics data to establish baselines and identify critical anomalies.
* **Customizable detection**. Allows configuration based on specific criteria, such as detecting multiple anomalies within a defined time window.
* **Playbook integration**. Streamlines diagnosis and recovery by automating responses through integrated playbooks.
