<!-- 
Monitor tags will work the same way as SLOs except for one difference: during tags creation, you will be able to see tag suggestions (both keys and values) from other domains as well. This means that during tag create/edit in SLOs suggestions from monitor tags will be visible as well and vice versa.

Ex: user creates tag `team=alerting` in monitor this tag key (`team`) and value (`alerting`) will be visible to the user in the suggestions while creating/editing tags for an SLO. During filtering by tags only tags for that domain will be visible in the suggestions i.e., only tags attached to monitors will be visible in the monitor filter bar.
