We've added the ability to tag your Monitors, allowing you to better categorize, search, filter, and correlate Monitors with other data. Tags are key/value pairs that allow you to apply additional metadata to your Monitors beyond their name and description. Example tag: `team=alerting`, where the key is `team` and value is `alerting`.
