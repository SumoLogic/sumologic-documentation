We've added a new feature to this release that allows you to configure multiple burn rate trigger conditions within an SLO monitor. This enhancement provides the ability to receive alerts for both short-term and long-term issues. With the short window burn rate, you can quickly detect any problems affecting the SLO monitor, while the long window burn rate ensures that significant impacts over a longer time period are identified.
