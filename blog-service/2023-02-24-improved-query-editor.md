Update - We've enhanced the query editor so that it's now more customizable, making it easier for you to work with long queries and larger results. With this update, you can now adjust the size of the search query editor, allowing for better visibility into long queries. This will be especially helpful for those of you who have found it difficult to review long queries in their entirety due to the fixed editor size. Additionally, you can reduce the size of the editor while examining larger results, making it easier to navigate through your data.
