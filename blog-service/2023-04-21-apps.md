We're excited to announce the release of the new Druva App for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic's [Cloud-to-Cloud Druva source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/druva-source) to provide real-time monitoring and security insight for your Druva account. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

* **Critical event alerts**. Get notified of potential security incidents with real-time alerts for user activities, device and app usage, and backup and restore events.
* **Granular visibility**. Gain detailed insights into user activity, alerts, and backup status to help you quickly detect and respond to security threats.
* **Seamless integration**. Easily integrate with your existing Druva account and Sumo Logic environment for a streamlined security operations workflow.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/druva) to learn how you can set up and use the Druva App for Sumo Logic.
