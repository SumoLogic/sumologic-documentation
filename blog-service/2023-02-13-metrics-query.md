We have added support for multiple metrics queries for the threshold-based definition for the **Query** field in the SLI definition. You can use it to generate derived time series using arithmetic operations with the help of [`joins`](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/introduction/joins/).

Multiple metrics queries can be defined from scratch on the SLO editor and the metrics page and imported to the SLO editor via the **Create an SLO** menu option.
