We're excited to introduce the new Zendesk app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Zendesk source to collect audit logs, providing security analysts with critical visibility into their Zendesk environment.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/zendesk/) to learn how to set up and use the Zendesk app for Sumo Logic.
