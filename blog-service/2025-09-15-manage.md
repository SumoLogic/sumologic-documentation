We are happy to announce that you can now configure and forward the log data from Sumo Logic to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) destination. Previously, data forwarding was limited only to AWS S3, going forward you can forward the log data, log data with metadata, or log data with metadata and enriched fields, in either CSV or JSON format to GCS.
