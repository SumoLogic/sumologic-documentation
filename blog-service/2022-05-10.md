New - We are excited to announce the Sumo Logic [1Password](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/1password) App release. You can now monitor your 1Password accountâ€™s sign-in and item usage events. The dashboards help in providing insights into failed authentications, successful authentication, event breakdown by client applications, type, category, users, geolocation of events, outliers, and threat analysis of sign-in events. This app also helps you secure your 1Password vault access by providing insights into user actions and threat intel analysis on clients accessing items in shared vaults.
