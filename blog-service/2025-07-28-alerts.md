To help you optimize query execution and improve data retrieval efficiency, weâ€™ve introduced time range limits for sub-queries in scheduled searches.

Key benifits of this enhancements include:

- Improved query performance and responsiveness.
- Encourage efficient search practices.
- Support sustainable resource usage.

**Who benefits**

Data analysts, IT operations, and security engineers seeking faster, more efficient investigations without compromising functionality.

**Why it matters?**

Inefficient long-term queries cost millions in compute resources and delay resolution times. This update keeps our platform high-performing and cost-effective, without sacrificing power or usability.

This change helps prevent long-running, inefficient queries, especially those impacting system stability and driving up costs. While maintaining flexibility, these optimizations protect system health and reduce operational overhead.
