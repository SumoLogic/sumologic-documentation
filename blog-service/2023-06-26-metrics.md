We've added the following enhancements to the `rate` and `delta` operators, elevating the capabilities for analyzing metrics in time series data.

* **Enhanced support to calculate the rate of change**. The rate operator now offers two different modes for calculating the rate of change between data points.
  * **Regular rate mode**. Calculates the rate of change between consecutive data points. It divides the difference in values by the difference in timestamps (in milliseconds) and scales it up to a per-second rate.
  * **Rate Over mode**. Allows you to calculate the average rate of change over a specified time window. It considers the first and last metric values within the given interval, providing insights into metric trends and fluctuations over time.

* **Support for Counters**. Both the `rate` and `delta` operators now support a dedicated counter mode when working with counters. This counter mode accounts for counter resets and ensures that the operators always return non-negative values.
  * In the **rate** operator, use the `rate counter` syntax to calculate the increase in counter value between data points, considering counter resets.
  * In the **delta** operator, use the `delta counter` syntax to determine the difference in counter values between consecutive data points, accounting for counter resets.

Leverage the new features in the `rate` and `delta` operators to make data-driven decisions and gain a detailed understanding of your metrics. Learn more about [`rate`](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/rate) and [`delta`](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/delta) operators.
