As part of our on-going product security improvements, we have introduced the [View Connections](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities/#data-management) role capability. This role capability allows a user to view or change webhook and ServiceNow connections associated with a Scheduled Search or a monitor. 

Starting June 24, 2024, new Scheduled Searches or monitors configured with Webhook or ServiceNow notification channels can only be viewed or assigned to those connections by users with the View Connections role capability. 

**Prior to June 24, 2024, assign the View Connections role capability to users where appropriate.** After this date, users who do not have this role capability assigned will no longer be able to configure a Scheduled Search or monitor with a webhook target.

For information about how to configure webhook and ServiceNow connections, see [Set Up Webhook Connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).
