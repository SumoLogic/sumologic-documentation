#### Apps

New - Weâ€™re happy to announce the release of the Sumo Logic App for [Host Metrics (EC2)](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/ec2-cloudwatch-metrics). This App allows you to collect your EC2 instance metrics using Sumo Logic Installed Collector and display them using predefined search queries and Dashboards. The App provides Dashboards to analyze EC2 instance metrics for CPU, disk, memory, and network.

Update - We are glad to update that the Sumo Logic App for [MongoDB Atlas](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/databases/mongodb-atlas) now allows you to monitor database operations and performance KPIs and provides visibility into the security posture of your clusters.
