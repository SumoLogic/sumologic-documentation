### New release

We’re excited to announce the release of new Azure Service Bus, Azure API Management, and AWS Serverless Application Models for Sumo Logic.

- **Azure Service Bus**. Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics (in a namespace) used for decoupling applications and services from each other. This integration helps in monitoring incoming/outgoing messages, connections, throttled requests, and resource usage of your Service Bus namespace. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-service-bus/).
- **Azure API Management**. Azure API Management is a hybrid multicloud platform for managing APIs across different environments. As a platform-as-a-service, it supports the entire API lifecycle and provides near real-time visibility into API status and health, offering essential API Management operations and details for auditing. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-api-management/).
- **Azure Event Grid**. Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns using the MQTT and HTTP protocols. This integration helps in monitoring data plane requests, delivery failures and publish failures of Event Grid resources - custom topics, system topics and domains. [Learn more](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-event-grid/)
- **AWS Serverless Application Models**. Released the following four SAMs with Python v3.13 and updated the AWS Lambda runtime with latest libraries:
    - `sumologic-securityhub-connector-aws-org` - SAM SemanticVersion: 1.0.8.
    - `sumologic-s3-logging-auto-enable` - SAM SemanticVersion: 1.0.15.
    - `sumologic-aws-cloudtrail-benchmark` - SAM SemanticVersion: 1.0.18.
