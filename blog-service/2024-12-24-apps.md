We're excited to introduce the new Cisco AMP app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Cisco AMP source that collects Cisco AMP logs from the Cisco AMP platform. This app helps security analysts with comprehensive tools to enhance threat detection capabilities, investigate incidents thoroughly, and fortify cybersecurity defenses proactively.
