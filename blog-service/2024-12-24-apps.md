### New release

We’re excited to announce the release of new Azure Service Bus, Azure API Management, and AWS Serverless Application Models for Sumo Logic.

- **Azure Service Bus**. Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics (in a namespace) used for decoupling applications and services from each other. This integration helps in monitoring incoming/outgoing messages, connections, throttled requests, and resource usage of your Service Bus namespace. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-service-bus/).

- **Azure API Management**. Azure API Management is a hybrid multicloud platform for managing APIs across different environments. As a platform-as-a-service, it supports the entire API lifecycle and provides near real-time visibility into API status and health, offering essential API Management operations and details for auditing. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-api-management/).

- **AWS Serverless Application Models**. Released the following four SAM’s with Python v3.13 and updated the AWS Lambda runtime with latest libraries.
