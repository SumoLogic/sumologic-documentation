We're happy to announce that you can view and export the metadata XML of your SAML configurations. 

From the SAML configuration details screen, click the **View Metadata XML** button to view and copy the metadata XML for that configuration. You can also use the getSamlMetadata API to export the metadata XML.

For more information, see our documentation on how to [export metadata XML](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#export-metadata-xml).
