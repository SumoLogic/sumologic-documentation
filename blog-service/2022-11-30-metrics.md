We're pleased to announce a new chart type for metric queries. A heat map visualizes the count of data points returned by a metrics query within specified value ranges over time intervals of a specified duration. For more information, see [Create a Heat Map](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/heat-map/).
