Archive of April 2022 Service Release Notes.


---
## April 28, 2022 (Security)

Update - The default [web session timeout](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/set-max-web-session-timeout) for new users has been increased from 15 minutes to 6 hours. If your currently configured session timeout is set to less than 6 hours, new users will receive the value set within the policy as the default.  

Update - We Increased the timeout for new user account verification from 12 hours to 72 hours to allow for weekends and to give new users more time to see and take action on the new user welcome email.

## April 26, 2022 (Collection)

New - Our [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework) has a new Source. The [Dropbox Source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/dropbox-source) provides a secure endpoint to receive team events from the [Get Events API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/teams#team_log-get_events).

Update - The [Tenable Source](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/tenable-source) now supports collecting [audit logs](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/audit-log-events) from the Audit Log API and [assets](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/exports-assets-request-export) from the Asset Export API. We've also added the ability to define Processing Rules.

## April 26, 2022 (Traces)

New - You can now add the results of Spans queries directly to Dashboards from the [Spans analytics](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/spans#Add-to-Dashboard) window. You'll use the same easy query builder to [modify your panels](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/dashboards-new/panels/modify-chart) later. You can still use [Log Search](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/search-query-language-support-for-traces) to add span results to Dashboards by running queries in the `_trace_spans` index. The same limitations of Log Search still apply, your query scan volume should not exceed 200x of your tracing ingest.

## April 17, 2022 (Apps)

Update - We’ve released an update to the [Amazon S3 app](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-s3-audit-source). The key improvement is a new **Threat Intel** dashboard that provides high-level views of threats across your S3 buckets and objects. We also added a new “S3_Bucket” filter to each of the dashboards, so you can slice and dice data by S3 bucket name.

## April 7, 2022 (Alerts)

New - System events for Alerts are now logged to the Sumo Logic Audit Event Index. You can use the alert system events to analyze your monitoring posture overall and answer questions like these, and more:

* How many alerts are created and resolved per day?
* Which monitors fire the most alerts?
* How long does it typically take to resolve alerts?

You can search for system events for Alerts by scoping your search like this:

```sql
_index=sumologic_system_events _sourceCategory=alerts
```

## April 6, 2022 (Monitors)

Update - The [alert history](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors#Monitor_History) of a Monitor is now quickly accessible on a new tab of the details pane.

## April 5, 2022 (Collection)

New - We're excited to announce a new milestone in innovation for Sumo Logic Observability with the [Sumo Logic OpenTelemetry Distro Collector](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector) (OT Distro).

The OT Distro Collector is designed to simplify and democratize the collection of logs, metrics, traces, and metadata from modern cloud applications. With this announcement, Sumo Logic further embraces open source and establishes OpenTelemetry as its future standard to collect all machine data, breaking from the legacy model of using proprietary agents to gather critical application and infrastructure telemetry.

## April 4, 2022 (Apps)

Update - We’ve updated two Sumo Logic apps for Palo Alto Networks to support PAN-OS 10:

* [PCI Compliance for Palo Alto Networks 10](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/pci-compliance/palo-alto-networks-10)
* [Palo Alto Firewall 10 - Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics](https://help.sumologic.com/integrations/cloud-security-monitoring-analytics/palo-alto-firewall-10)
