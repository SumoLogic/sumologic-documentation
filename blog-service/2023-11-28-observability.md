We are excited to announce several improvements to our AWS Observability solution.  

* **AWS Observability Hub**. A landing page to access all the capabilities of the Sumo Logic AWS Observability solution, including the out-of-the-box dashboards, alerts, and performance benchmark reports, all from a single place.
* **Log Searches for Troubleshooting**. Quickly troubleshoot issues within your AWS environment with pre-baked log searches. No need to learn the search query syntax. These new searches can be accessed from the new hub page.

To learn more about the AWS Observability solution and how to set it up, check out our documentation [here](/docs/observability/aws/). 

NOTE: To access these new capabilities, you just have to install the AWS Observability solution. If you have one already installed, congratulations! You'll gain access to these new features automatically.
