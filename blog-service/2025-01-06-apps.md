We're excited to introduce the new Trend Micro Vision One app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Trend Micro Vision One source that collects alert logs data from the Trend Micro Vision One platform. This app helps you can gain real-time visibility into security events and incidents within your organization's infrastructure, allowing them to detect and react to potential threats quickly.
