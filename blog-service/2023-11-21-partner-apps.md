We've released two new Partner apps for Sumo Logic:

- [Dataminr Pulse for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/DataminrPulse) enables rapid identification and mitigation of emerging threats so you can deliver more time to detection and response.
- [Jamf Protect for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/JamfProtect) empowers security teams with in-depth visibility into Mac security events, providing integrated visualization for enriched investigation into macOS threat alerting with tuned endpoint telemetry data streams. This app supports data streams from the macOS security and Jamf security cloud portals, resulting in one single collection point for all endpoint and network-based events that occur across your Apple device fleet. With the Jamf Protect app, Sumo Logic users can easily integrate their Apple security data, gain valuable insights into Apple's security posture, and quickly respond to security incidents.
