We're excited to introduce the new CrowdStrike Spotlight app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud CrowdStrike Spotlight source to collect vulnerability logs through the CrowdStrike Spotlight API, helping you to obtain real-time visibility into vulnerabilities across your organization's assets to the security teams.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/crowdstrike-spotlight/) to learn how to set up and use the CrowdStrike Spotlight app for Sumo Logic.
