We’re excited to announce that Health Events are now automatically generated when 90% credit usage threshold is exceeded for Lookup Tables, Partitions, Fields, or Field Extraction Rules (FERs). These health events can further be configured to receive timely alerts whenever a threshold breach occurs, ensuring that all designated recipients are promptly notified when the health event is triggered every time.
