We're happy to announce a change in the behavior of the `count` operator. Previously, the `count` operator was supported by the `Int` data type, which could result in a negative count value when exceeding the maximum integer value. To address this, we are changing the data type of the `count` operator from `Int` to `Long` data type to support the handling of large numeric values. 

This change will apply to all new queries. Any existing queries as part of various content types - Log Search, [Scheduled Search](/docs/manage/scheduled-views/scheduled-views-best-practices/#upgrade-your-scheduled-views-to-avoid-negative-count-results), [Lookup Table](/docs/search/lookup-tables/manage-update-lookup-tables/#upgrade-the-lookup-table-to-avoid-negative-count-results), and Saved Search will also seamlessly transition to show `Long` values in case of `Int` overflow.
