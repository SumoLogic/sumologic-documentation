We're happy to announce a change in the behavior of the `count` operator. Previously, the `count` operator was supported by the `Int` data type, which could result in a negative count value after when exceeding the maximum integer value. To address this, we are changing the data type of the `count` operator from `Int` to `Long` data type to support the handling of large numeric values. 

This change will apply to all new queries. However, it may pose challenges for existing saved searches, scheduled searches, searches using the `count` operator as part of the scheduled view, and searches using the `count` operator as part of lookup tables. Below are some conditions to address these challenges:

    - For existing scheduled views, the query will use the `Int` data type, while new scheduled views will utilize the `Long` data type for the `count` operator.
    - For existing lookup tables, if the schema type is `Int` and the field type is `Long`, there can be possible overflow, resulting in a negative count value after crossing the maximum integer value. If the schema type is `Long` and the field type is `Int` there will be no issues. For new lookup tables, both the schema type and field type will use the `Long` data type for the `count` operator.
