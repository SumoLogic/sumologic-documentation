We're happy to announce a change in the behavior of the `count` operator. Previously, the `count` operator was supported by the `Int` data type, which could result in a negative count value when exceeding the maximum integer value. To address this, we are changing the data type of the `count` operator from `Int` to `Long` data type to support the handling of large numeric values. 

This change will apply to all new queries. Any existing queries as part of various content types - Log Search, Scheduled Search, and Saved Search will also seamlessly transition to show `Long` values in case of `Int` overflow.

:::note
New scheduled views and lookup query will support `Long` data type for the `count` operator.
:::

- For existing scheduled views, the query will use the `Int` data type, while new scheduled views will utilize the `Long` data type for the `count` operator.
- For existing lookup tables, lookup schema matching has been relaxed to allow Int-Long type mismatch, in order to support this new behavioural change. If the schema type is `Int` and the field type is `Long`, there can be possible overflow, resulting in a negative count value after crossing the maximum integer value. If the schema type is `Long` and the field type is `Int` there will be no issues.
