Update -  We’ve made [alerts and monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

* Customize the alert name to differentiate between multiple alerts created from the same monitor.   
* Choose recovery based on “Single Data point” meeting the recovery threshold or “all data points” meeting the threshold before the alert is resolved.
