We are excited to announce the ability to manage library content on the new **Content Management** tab. Now MSSP administrators can conveniently push content in the **Library** folder to multiple child organizations at once, including dashboards, saved searches, and scheduled searches. [Learn more](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-and-manage-orgs/manage-orgs-for-mssps/).
