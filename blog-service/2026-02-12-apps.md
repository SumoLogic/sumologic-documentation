We're excited to introduce the new Sumo Logic app for Azure Firewall. This app enables centralized monitoring of Azure Firewall logs and metrics to gain real-time visibility into firewall health, network and application rules, threat intelligence alerts, and IDPS events. With prebuilt dashboards and insights, it helps you detect threats faster, troubleshoot issues, and maintain secure and reliable cloud network operations at scale.
