New - If you are using [Sumo Logic Cloud SOAR](https://www.sumologic.com/solutions/cloud-soar/), you can now integrate Monitors and Scheduled Searches with Cloud SOAR via a new [webhook connection](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/connections-integrations/webhook-connections/cloud-soar). This new capability allows you to send Alerts to Cloud SOAR to further process and operate on these incidents. The result is a rich and connected experience between your data residing in Sumo Logic and the security response capabilities within Cloud SOAR.
