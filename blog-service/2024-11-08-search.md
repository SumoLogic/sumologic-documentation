In May 2024, we introduced [new visualization charts](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-basics/chart-search-results/#new-visualization) for all the Log Search queries, with which you can customize each chart by modifying the available settings and obtain a unified experience across the Sumo Logic platforms.

**On November 22. 2024**, Sumo Logic will remove the **Switch to Classic Visualization** button, and you will no longer be able to switch to view the charts in classic visualization. By default, all your charts will appear in the New Visualization style.
