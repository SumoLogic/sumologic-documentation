We're excited to announce the release of the new Palo Alto Cortex XDR app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Palo Alto Cortex XDR source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/palo-alto-cortex-xdr-source/) to provide visibility and analysis of alerts and incidents from the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR platform. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**. Gain real-time visibility into security events and incidents across your organization's infrastructure. Monitor and analyze alerts, threats, and suspicious activities to detect and promptly respond to potential threats.
- **Interactive Dashboards**. Explore interactive dashboards that provide a holistic view of alerts, incidents, and threat intelligence. Visualize data with pre-built charts, graphs, and tables to understand trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- **Incident Management**. Streamline incident management processes by tracking security incidents. Monitor incident status, and collaborate with your security team for effective incident response.
