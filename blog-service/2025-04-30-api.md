Effective April 30, 2025, Sumo Logic will no longer support data ingestion or API access via the India deployment (`https://api.in.sumologic.com/`).

**Action Required**: If you are still using the India endpoint, please update your configurations to point to a supported deployment. Refer to the [endpoint guide](/docs/api/getting-started/#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security) for options.

What this means for you:
* After this date, all ingestion to the Mumbai data center will be disabled.
* Historical data from the India deployment will not be migrated to a new deployment.
* Affected customers were asked to select an alternate data center (such as Tokyo, Korea, or the US) ahead of the deprecation date.

If you have any questions or need help with the migration, please reach out to [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/).
