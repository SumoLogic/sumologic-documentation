Effective April 30, 2025, we are retiring the `https://api.in.sumologic.com/` endpoint.

**Action Required**: If you're using this endpoint, please update your integrations to use the appropriate Sumo Logic deployment endpoint. You can find your correct endpoint [here](/docs/api/getting-started/#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).

This change is part of our effort to streamline and simplify our supported API infrastructure.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/).
