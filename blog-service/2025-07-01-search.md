Sumo Logic Copilot now supports unstructured logs—raw, text-based logs that don't follow a structured format—without requiring Field Extraction Rules (FERs). This enhancement enables Copilot to analyze and derive insights from a broader range of log data using natural language, even if the logs aren't pre-parsed. If your logs are already visualized in dashboards, Copilot automatically parses them and delivers insights using natural language.

This update builds on Copilot’s AI-assisted search capabilities and is available to all customers using the new Sumo Logic UI. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot/).
