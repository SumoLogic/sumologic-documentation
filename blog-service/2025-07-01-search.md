Sumo Logic Copilot is now generally available with two major enhancements that improve usability and investigation speed:

* **Unstructured Logs Support**. Copilot can now analyze raw, text-based logs that don't follow a structured format—no Field Extraction Rules (FERs) required. If your logs are already visualized in dashboards, Copilot automatically parses them and delivers insights using natural language.
* **Multi-Turn Conversations**. You can now ask follow-up questions without repeating your search context. Copilot remembers your investigation flow, making it easier to refine queries, explore related issues, and resolve incidents faster.

These updates build on Copilot’s AI-assisted search capabilities and are available to all customers using the new Sumo Logic UI. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot/).
