---
## September 1, 2021 (Alerts)

New - Our [monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors) capabilities provide a new alerting framework to support anomaly-based alerting for both logs and metrics data sources. It's a more flexible alert system, better equipped to identify true outliers in your ever changing environment and you can find it in Alerts > Monitors.

Anomaly-based alerting does not require a static alert threshold, offering a more flexible way to determine outliers in your data. Our system automatically creates dynamic baselines, and alerts the user, when there is an abnormal trend in the alerting KPI compared to its historic behavior. 

You should definitely try out the new outlier support in monitors if you have custom KPIs that constantly change over time such as requests, latency, and errors. These KPIs constantly change based on external and internal factors such as changes in customer usage patterns, code changes, and feature releases.

---
## August 12, 2021 (Security)

Update - We made a small but useful change to our [SAML support](/docs/manage/security). Now, if you have multiple Sumo Logic SAML integrations and use SP-Initiated logins, the EntityID Sumo Logic sends with authentication requests is unique for each of your integrations. The benefit: this means Sumo Logic SAML supports IdPs that require a unique EntityID for each integration. The EntityID is displayed in the SAML configuration details pane. 

The unique Entity ID is provided in SAML configurations created after August 11, 2021. For existing SAML configurations, the Entity ID remains unchanged but is now displayed along with other configuration details.

---
## August 11, 2021 (Metrics)

---
## March 16, 2021 (Alerts)

Update - We have resolved a discrepancy in the notification payload of [Real Time Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/create-real-time-alert).

Previously, the payload for subsequent real time alerts in a given time range would incrementally report the results and omit the records that were already present in the previous alert.

For example, if the Scheduled Search initially returned 10 records, the first alert notification would contain 10 records in the payload. If the next run contained the same 10 records plus 1 additional, the notification payload would only contain the single new record.

Going forward, we will ensure that the records sent in the notification payload will always contain all the records returned in the Scheduled Search. Following the above example, the next run of the Real Time Scheduled Search would return 11 records. This change ensures that the payload will always match the results of the search in Sumo Logic.

## March 11, 2021 (Metrics)

Planned deprecation - Round 1 of automatic migration is complete. Most monitors were successfully migrated and are now muted---we'll start deleting them on March 18. If you have monitors that were not successfully migrated, we'll let you know which monitors weren't migrated and why. For information about how to manually migrate those monitors, see Metrics Monitors Deprecation FAQs.

## March 8, 2021 (Apps)

Update - We have updated our [Enterprise Audit - Security Management App](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/enterprise-audit) to now support ServiceAllowlist audit events.

---
## March 4, 2021 (Observability)

Update - We're delighted to announce several enhancements to [Root Cause Explorer](/docs/observability/root-cause-explorer "Root Cause Explorer"). Root Cause Explorer now supports two additional AWS namespaces, as well as Events of Interest detection on Kubernetes and Trace metrics. Cause-impact analysis is now informed by Sumo Logic Tracing's Service Map, AWS X-ray, Kubernetes entities, and AWS inventory relationships. You'll also notice new filters and search builders at the top of the page to correlate Events of Interests at the service, orchestrator, AWS infrastructure, and host levels to speed up the identification of  root causes. You can use the Infrastructure tab for an Event of Interest to pivot to dashboards, logs, metrics and, trace searches to take the next steps in root cause analysis.

Planned deprecation - We're starting the next step in the process of Metrics Monitors today: we're beginning the first of two rounds of migrating old-style monitors to new [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors). The next milestone is March 15, when we'll remove the old monitors that were successfully migrated in the first round. For more information, see Metrics Monitors Deprecation FAQs.

## February 26, 2021 (Dashboard (New))

Update - [Dashboard (New)](/docs/dashboards-new) is all about visual control! We're happy to announce that you can now add units to your charts to make them even easier to consume. With the updated chart units on dashboard panels, you can select a base unit and the chart will auto-adjust the unit as the numbers scale, making the data immediately understandable. See how to [modify chart axes](/docs/dashboards-new/panels/modify-chart) for details.

## February 22, 2021 (Metrics)

Planned deprecation - We've taken the next step in the process of Metrics Monitors today: the ability to create new Metrics Monitors from the UI and API is disabled. For more information, see Metrics Monitors Deprecation FAQs. 

---
## February 15, 2021 (Metrics)

Planned deprecation - We're planning to deprecate the Metrics Monitors feature in favor of the [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) feature we released late last year, which unifies the alert experience across logs and metrics. Important to note: Sumo Logic will automatically migrate most of your existing metrics monitors. The deprecation process will occur in stages, starting next week and culminating in early May. Today, affected customers will receive an in-product communication describing the deprecation process and schedule and what to expect. For more information, see Metrics Monitors Deprecation FAQs.

## February 12, 2021 (Security)

Update - We're releasing a change to audit logging for [monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) on Monday, February 15. We've improved the audit logging we do when you import, copy, or delete a  monitor. We now log an audit event for every object created or deleted by an import, copy, or delete operation.

---
## February 10, 2021 (Manage)

Update - We made the process of transferring a deleted user's content to another user more comprehensive. Now, when you select a new owner for the deleted user's Library content, scheduled views will be transferred to the new owner, as well as the user's folders, searches, scheduled searches, and dashboards. For more information, see [Delete a User](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/delete-user).

## February 5, 2021 (AWS Observability)

Update - We are excited to announce support for [ECS](/docs/observability/aws/integrations/amazon-ecs), [ElastiCache](/docs/observability/aws), and [Network Load Balancers](/docs/observability/aws) as well as [out-of-the-box alerts](/docs/observability/aws) for all supported services. As part of this release we have [documented changes](/docs/observability/aws) included in each version of our CloudFormation installation template, which will help you understand when to upgrade.

---
## February 3, 2021 (Manage)

Update - There are two changes to the Partitions page in the Sumo Logic UI. What we previously called the General Index is now the Default Continuous Partition. This is where any data you ingest that isn't assigned to a partition goes. You'll also notice that the Partitions page now lists Sumo Logic internal indexes, like the Audit Event Index and the Data Volume Index. This gives you the flexibility to [manage the retention period](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/create-edit-partition) for each index independently. By default, each internal index has the same retention period as the Default Continuous Partition.

## January 22, 2021 (Metrics)

Update - We've made a small change to the [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer) that makes a big difference:  Advanced Mode now supports auto-complete. Now, just as in Basic Mode, you can construct metric queries in Advanced Mode by selecting metadata fields, dimensions, metrics, and operators from pull-down lists.

## January 15, 2021 (Dashboard (New))

Update - Dashboard (New) now offers a dark theme. [Dark Theme](/docs/dashboards-new/about) makes dashboards pop by putting light colored visualizations and text on top of a darker background. This enables you to build gorgeous dashboards with eye-catching contrast.
