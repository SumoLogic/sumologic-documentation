## September 1, 2021 (Alerts)

New - Our [monitor](https://help.sumologic.com/Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Monitors) capabilities provide a new alerting framework to support anomaly-based alerting for both logs and metrics data sources.

Anomaly-based alerting does not require a static alert threshold, offering a more flexible way to determine outliers in your data. Our system automatically creates dynamic baselines, and alerts the user, when there is an abnormal trend in the alerting KPI compared to its historic behavior. 

You should definitely try out the new outlier support in monitors if you have custom KPIs that constantly change over time such as requests, latency, and errors. These KPIs constantly change based on external and internal factors such as changes in customer usage patterns, code changes, and feature releases.

-->
---
## March 16, 2021 (Alerts)

Update - We have resolved a discrepancy in the notification payload of [Real Time Scheduled Searches](https://help.sumologic.com/Visualizations-and-Alerts/Alerts/Scheduled-Searches/Create_a_Real_Time_Alert#Notification_Results "Create a Real Time Alert").

Previously, the payload for subsequent real time alerts in a given time range would incrementally report the results and omit the records that were already present in the previous alert.

For example, if the Scheduled Search initially returned 10 records, the first alert notification would contain 10 records in the payload. If the next run contained the same 10 records plus 1 additional, the notification payload would only contain the single new record.

Going forward, we will ensure that the records sent in the notification payload will always contain all the records returned in the Scheduled Search. Following the above example, the next run of the Real Time Scheduled Search would return 11 records. This change ensures that the payload will always match the results of the search in Sumo Logic.

## February 3, 2021 (Manage)

Update - There are two changes to the Partitions page in the Sumo Logic UI. What we previously called the General Index is now the Default Continuous Partition. This is where any data you ingest that isn't assigned to a partition goes. You'll also notice that the Partitions page now lists Sumo Logic internal indexes, like the Audit Event Index and the Data Volume Index. This gives you the flexibility to [manage the retention period](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Partitions_and_Data_Tiers/04_Edit_a_Partition#Edit_a_partition "Edit a Partition") for each index independently. By default, each internal index has the same retention period as the Default Continuous Partition.
