We're excited to announce the opt-in general availability of our Sumo Logic New UI. This release introduces several enhancements designed to improve your overall experience:

* **Unified Navigation**. Access all Observability features (e.g., Alerts, Log Search, Metrics) and Security features (e.g., Cloud SIEM, Cloud SOAR) through a single, unified left-navigation menu. Unlike the Classic UI, there's no need to navigate away when switching between Observability and Security tools.
* **Streamlined Administration**. Key administrative functions such as Data Configuration, Help, and User Preferences are now conveniently located in the top toolbar for easier access.
* **Enhanced Browsing Experience**. We've replaced in-app tabs with native browser tabs to provide a more familiar browsing experience. Enjoy session history, back button support, favorites, and other native browser functionalities.
* **Improved Performance**. The simplified UI boosts performance and usability, offering a smoother and faster browsing experience that enables quicker incident resolution. Key improvements include:
   * **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**. Notable improvements in FCP, resulting in faster page loads and improved responsiveness.
   * **Time to Interactivity (TTI)**. Significant reduction in TTI, enhancing the speed at which users can interact with the UI.
* **Stateful URLs**. URLs now reflect real-time changes made within the UI. This ensures that any modifications are immediately reflected in the URL parameters, allowing for easy sharing of the latest content with your team.

Explore these improvements and check out our [documentation](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui). We value your feedback as we continue to refine our UI.
