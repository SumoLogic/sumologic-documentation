### Copilot is now Mobot

We've renamed Copilot, Sumo Logic's AI-powered log search query assistant, to *Mobot*. This rename is live for all customers, with no additional setup required.  

### Multi-turn conversations (Beta)

Alongside the rename, we've introduced multi-turn conversation functionality in Beta. If enabled, you can ask follow-up questions without repeating your search context, making investigations more natural and iterative:  

* **Clarifications when needed**. If your request is ambiguous, Mobot may ask a follow-up question to narrow intent.  
* **Smarter error handling**. Contextual error messages explain why a query failed and suggest fixes.  
* **Guided exploration**. Intent cards summarize your goal, while suggestion cards offer refinements with a click.  
* **Conversation pane**. See your prompts, refinements, and results in one place, with history you can revisit or branch from.  
* **Dashboard-aware translations via RAG**. Mobot references recent dashboard queries to improve accuracy.
