We're introducing two important updates to Copilot, Sumo Logic's conversational log search experience.

### Multi-turn conversations (Beta)

The new multi-turn conversation experience lets you ask follow-up questions without repeating your search context, making investigations more natural and iterative.

Enhancements include:

* **Dashboard-aware translations (RAG)**. Mobot references recent dashboard queries to improve accuracy.
* **Conversation pane**. See your prompts, refinements, and results in one place, with history you can revisit or branch from.
* **Guided exploration**. Intent cards summarize your goal, and suggestion cards offer refinements with a click.
* **Context-aware clarifications and error guidance**. If a request is ambiguous or fails, Mobot asks follow-up questions and suggests fixes to get you back on track.
* **Log search canvas mode**. A focused workspace for deeper investigations that keeps context together while you pivot, refine, and compare results.

### Copilot is now Mobot (staggered rollout with multi-turn)

As part of the staggered rollout of Mobotâ€™s new conversational UI (Beta), Copilot is being renamed to *Mobot*.

The Mobot name and experience are available only in organizations included in the multi-turn conversations Beta rollout. To request access, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or Support. During the transition, some UI labels and screenshots may still show *Copilot*.

[Learn more](/docs/search/mobot-multiturn-beta).

All other customers will continue to see *Copilot* until general availability.
