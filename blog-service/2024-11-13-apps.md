We're excited to introduce the new Kandji app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Kandji source to collect threat events and device events, thereby maintaining a secure Apple device environment and strengthening organizational security posture.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/kandji/) to learn how to set up and use the Kandji app for Sumo Logic.
