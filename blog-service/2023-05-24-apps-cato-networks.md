We're excited to announce the release of the new Cato Networks app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Cato Networks source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/cato-networks-source/) to provide real-time insights into the events and helps you to identify potential security threats with admin activities. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Security event analysis**. This app provides a holistic view of event-related metrics and insights, which helps you to detect and respond to security threats in the Cato Networks environment.
- **Threat analysis**. This app offers a comprehensive overview of threat-related information that allows you to understand and address potential risks effectively, thereby supporting risk management and response strategies.
- **Audit summary**. This app includes pre-built reports and visualizations of audit logs which facilitates effective monitoring, analysis, and identification of any unusual or suspicious activities within the system.
- **Customization and Integration**. Customize and tailor your dashboards, reports, and alerts to align specific monitoring and security needs. It also supports integration with other security tools and platforms, enabling a centralized view of the overall security landscape.
