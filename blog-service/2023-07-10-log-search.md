New - We're excited to announce automatic log level detection for Log Search queries. You can now quickly identify anomalies without having to search through large volume of logs to find high severity issues.

With this update, you can now visualize and filter log-level distribution in both your **Histogram** results and **Messages** table. This allows you to view messages of specific log level(s) in the same view. [Learn more](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-page/log-level).
