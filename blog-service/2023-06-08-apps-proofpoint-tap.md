We're excited to announce the release of the new Proofpoint TAP app for Sumo Logic. This app helps you to strengthen your security posture by providing comprehensive visibility and analysis of messages and clicks on malicious URLs. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Message Protection**. Provides sophisticated email analysis techniques and helps you to identify malicious emails, such as those containing malware, ransomware, or phishing attempts.
- **URL Defense**. Analyzes URLs in real-time and help you to identify malicious websites or links used for phishing or spreading malware.
- **Attachment Defense**. Examines your email attachments for potential threats, including infected files or documents containing macros that can execute malicious code.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/proofpoint-tap) to learn how you can set up and use the Proofpoint TAP app for Sumo Logic.
