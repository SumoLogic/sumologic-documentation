New - We’re released a new metrics operator: `predict`. The `predict` operator takes as input a single time series metric to predict future values. Predicting metrics such as CPU usage or memory consumption is useful for resource and capacity planning. For more information, see [predict Metrics Operator](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/predict/).
