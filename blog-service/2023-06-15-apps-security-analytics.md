Weâ€™re excited to announce a new version of the Sumo Logic Security Analytics app. The new app enables you to leverage out-of-the-box alerts for advanced analytics and threat detection, along with risk score based prioritization. Here are some of the key features the new app offers: 

* **Alerts analysis**. Get a holistic view into the alerts generated from rules, including the top 10 alerts, alert geolocations, unusual alerts, and alert spikes. 
* **Entity risk assessment**. View the high-risk Entities in your system for a selected time period.
* **MITRE ATT&CK correlation**. See the top 10 alerts, including their [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) tactics and techniques, and the Entities involved. Click an Entity name to drill down to see rules and MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques involved in events for that Entity. 

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/security-analytics/) to learn how you can set up and use the Sumo Logic Security Analytics app.
