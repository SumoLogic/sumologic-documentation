We are excited to introduce several enhancements to the Logs Search experience with Intellisense. This update is designed to simplify query building and improve efficiency for both new and advanced users.

Key features:

* **Syntax-driven autocompletion**. Autocompletes query syntax in real-time, reducing errors and speeding up query creation.
* **Enhanced key-value pair support**. Improved parsing and suggestions for structured log data like JSON.
* **Next-operator prediction**. Predicts the next logical operator or clause, streamlining the query-writing process.
* **Log assist UI revamp**. An updated user interface that enhances usability and query-building efficiency.
* **Facet determination for JSON logs**. Automatically identifies and suggests facets for better filtering and data discovery.

These features are now live in the new code editor, designed to offer a smoother, more intuitive experience when writing log search queries.
