We're happy to announce the release of our new partner app for Endace. Endace delivers scalable, always-on packet capture in on-premise and hybrid cloud environments for definitive network visibility. The Endace App includes premade dashboards for logs such as Zeek, Suricata, Cisco ASA, Cisco Firepower and Palo Alto Networks, which include a Pivot-to-Vision link to connect you to your EndaceProbe for further investigation.
