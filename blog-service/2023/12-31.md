#### Download SAML Metadata XML

We're happy to announce that you can download the metadata XML of your SAML configurations. The service provider metadata XML allows you to easily share the Sumo Logic configuration information with your identity provider administrators, assisting them with the SAML setup process.

From the SAML configuration details screen, click the **Download Metadata XML** button to download the metadata XML for that configuration. You can also use the getSamlMetadata API to export the metadata XML.

For more information, see our documentation on how to [download metadata XML](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#download-metadata-xml).

#### Logs for Monitoring and Troubleshooting for AWS

We are excited to announce several improvements to our AWS Observability solution.  

* **AWS Observability Hub**. A landing page to access all the capabilities of the Sumo Logic AWS Observability solution, including the out-of-the-box dashboards, alerts, and performance benchmark reports, all from a single place.
* **Log Searches for Troubleshooting**. Quickly troubleshoot issues within your AWS environment with pre-baked log searches. No need to learn the search query syntax. These new searches can be accessed from the new hub page.

To learn more about the AWS Observability solution and how to set it up, check out our documentation [here](/docs/observability/aws/).

:::note
To access these new capabilities, you just have to install the AWS Observability solution. If you have one already installed, congratulations! You'll gain access to these new features automatically.

#### Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS - Preview

We’re excited to announce a preview of Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS. This solution unifies views of active threats, security control failures, and suspicious activity across your AWS environment to give you security posture visibility at a glance.  

Here are some of the key features the new solution offers:
* **Risk overview**. See a summary of all resources that pose risks in a single dashboard that rolls up the findings from other dashboards. Get an action plan for addressing the most important areas of concern.
* **Active threats**. See active threats in APIs, resources, and storage.
* **Misconfigurations**. See areas in your environment that need to be addressed because they fail best practice security controls.
* **Suspicious activity assessment**. See suspicious activity across users, web interactions, networks, and Identity Access Management (IAM).

To learn how you can set up and use Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS, and for preview limitations, check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws).

:::note
To use the solution, you are required to sign up and activate Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub.

#### New Partner Apps

We've released two new Partner apps for Sumo Logic:

- [Dataminr Pulse for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/DataminrPulse) enables rapid identification and mitigation of emerging threats so you can deliver more time to detection and response.
- [Jamf Protect for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/JamfProtect) empowers security teams with in-depth visibility into Mac security events, providing integrated visualization for enriched investigation into macOS threat alerting with tuned endpoint telemetry data streams. This app supports data streams from the macOS security and Jamf security cloud portals, resulting in one single collection point for all endpoint and network-based events that occur across your Apple device fleet. With the Jamf Protect app, Sumo Logic users can easily integrate their Apple security data, gain valuable insights into Apple's security posture, and quickly respond to security incidents.

### November 7, 2023 (Alerts)

#### Time Zone Settings for Monitors

We've rolled out the ability to designate a **Preferred Time Zone** when you're setting up alert monitor notifications. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor#step-3-notifications-optional).

**NOTE**: Currently, we support time zone specifications within an email action object. This is being deprecated for *API and Terraform users only* and will not be supported effective February 2024.

### November 2, 2023 (Observability)

#### AWS Observability 2.7.0

We are excited to announce AWS Observability 2.7.0. This update includes:

* Support for Amazon RDS - new out-of-the-box dashboards based on RDS logs including MySQL to support diagnosing slow queries
* Support for Terraform 5.x
* Updated Lambda functions runtime version to Python 3.11 includes functions for auto-subscription to CloudWatch log groups, CloudWatch Logs forwarder functions, or functions used to set up CloudWatch Metric Stream.

To learn more, see [Updating Your AWS Observability Stack](/docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/update-aws-observability-stack).

### October 27, 2023 (Manage)

#### Role Based Search Index

We're excited to announce that you can use roles to restrict access to specific data in search indexes. When you create a role, you can select **Index based** filters to allow access to data based on indexes, or you can select **Advanced filter** to define a dataset to allow access based on search criteria. This ensures that users only see the data they are supposed to.

[Learn more](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/rbac-for-indexes).

:::note
This feature is in Beta. To participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or our Support Team.

#### Kubernetes Helm v4 Chart Update

We’re excited to announce that we've updated the Sumo Logic Kubernetes Helm Chart from v3 to v4. With this update, our Helm chart is now packaged to collect logs, events, and metrics using the more cost-effective and faster OpenTelemetry collector. To further streamline this solution, we've also removed dependencies on third-party solutions like Fluentbit, Fluentd, and Prometheus.

To learn more, see [Set up Data Collection for Kubernetes](/docs/observability/kubernetes/collection-setup) and the diagram below, which distinguishes support available on Falco for collection and enrichment.

### October 2, 2023 (Dashboards)

#### Classic Dashboards Deprecation

Effective today, Sumo Logic has removed the ability to create or copy Classic Dashboards from within Sumo Logic. We understand that you may have existing classic dashboards that you may still need to access and use. To make this transition as seamless as possible, we have implemented the following:

- **Automatic Migration**. If you have edit permissions to a classic dashboard, when you open the dashboard we will automatically create a new copy of the dashboard.
- **Choice of Version**. Once your classic dashboard has been migrated, when opening a classic dashboard we will provide you the option to open the new version of the dashboard or continue with the classic version.  

Once you have had a chance to review the new dashboard, we recommend that you delete the classic version of the dashboard.

On January 8, 2024, Sumo Logic will no longer support the viewing of classic dashboards and will begin a process to auto migrate your remaining classic dashboards. Please note that this migration may take a little time, so you may still encounter classic dashboards within your account during this period. Here is what you can expect beginning January 8:

- **Automatic Migration**. When opening a classic dashboard from the Library or via a previously shared link, the classic dashboard will be automatically migrated and you will be redirected to the new version of that dashboard.
- **Library Clean Up**. Once a classic dashboard has been successfully migrated to a new dashboard, it will be automatically removed from your Library.

We're excited to announce the release of the new Tenable app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Tenable source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/tenable-source/) to gain comprehensive visibility and actionable insights into your organization's security posture. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Vulnerability Assessment**. Perform in-depth vulnerability assessments across your infrastructure using the [Tenable Vulnerabilities API](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/exports-vulns-request-export).
- **Audit Event Monitoring**. Monitor and analyze critical audit events within your organization using the [Tenable Audit Events API](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/audit-log-events).

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/tenable/) to learn how you can set up and use the Tenable app for Sumo Logic.
