#### Logs for Monitoring and Troubleshooting for AWS

We are excited to announce several improvements to our AWS Observability solution.  

* **AWS Observability Hub**. A landing page to access all the capabilities of the Sumo Logic AWS Observability solution, including the out-of-the-box dashboards, alerts, and performance benchmark reports, all from a single place.
* **Log Searches for Troubleshooting**. Quickly troubleshoot issues within your AWS environment with pre-baked log searches. No need to learn the search query syntax. These new searches can be accessed from the new hub page.

To learn more about the AWS Observability solution and how to set it up, check out our documentation [here](/docs/observability/aws/).

:::note
To access these new capabilities, you just have to install the AWS Observability solution. If you have one already installed, congratulations! You'll gain access to these new features automatically.

#### Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS - Preview

We’re excited to announce a preview of Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS. This solution unifies views of active threats, security control failures, and suspicious activity across your AWS environment to give you security posture visibility at a glance.  

Here are some of the key features the new solution offers:
* **Risk overview**. See a summary of all resources that pose risks in a single dashboard that rolls up the findings from other dashboards. Get an action plan for addressing the most important areas of concern.
* **Active threats**. See active threats in APIs, resources, and storage.
* **Misconfigurations**. See areas in your environment that need to be addressed because they fail best practice security controls.
* **Suspicious activity assessment**. See suspicious activity across users, web interactions, networks, and Identity Access Management (IAM).

To learn how you can set up and use Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS, and for preview limitations, check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/security/additional-security-features/cloud-infrastructure-security/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws/).

:::note
To use the solution, you are required to sign up and activate Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub.

#### New Partner Apps

We've released two new Partner apps for Sumo Logic:

- [Dataminr Pulse for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/DataminrPulse) enables rapid identification and mitigation of emerging threats so you can deliver more time to detection and response.
- [Jamf Protect for Sumo Logic](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/JamfProtect) empowers security teams with in-depth visibility into Mac security events, providing integrated visualization for enriched investigation into macOS threat alerting with tuned endpoint telemetry data streams. This app supports data streams from the macOS security and Jamf security cloud portals, resulting in one single collection point for all endpoint and network-based events that occur across your Apple device fleet. With the Jamf Protect app, Sumo Logic users can easily integrate their Apple security data, gain valuable insights into Apple's security posture, and quickly respond to security incidents.

### October 2, 2023 (Dashboards)

#### Classic Dashboards Deprecation

Effective today, Sumo Logic has removed the ability to create or copy Classic Dashboards from within Sumo Logic. We understand that you may have existing classic dashboards that you may still need to access and use. To make this transition as seamless as possible, we have implemented the following:

- **Automatic Migration**. If you have edit permissions to a classic dashboard, when you open the dashboard we will automatically create a new copy of the dashboard.
- **Choice of Version**. Once your classic dashboard has been migrated, when opening a classic dashboard we will provide you the option to open the new version of the dashboard or continue with the classic version.  

Once you have had a chance to review your new dashboards, we recommend deleting the classic versions of your dashboards.

On January 8, 2024, Sumo Logic will no longer support the viewing of classic dashboards and will begin a process to auto migrate your remaining classic dashboards. Please note that this migration may take a little time, so you may still encounter classic dashboards within your account during this period. Here is what you can expect beginning January 8:

**Automatic Migration**. When opening a classic dashboard from the Library or via a previously shared link, the classic dashboard will be automatically migrated and you will be redirected to the new version of that dashboard.

#### Dashboard Time Range Enhancements

We are excited to announce a new set of changes that enhance the time range management capabilities within dashboards and dashboard panels. With these updates, you'll have more control over time ranges, making it easier to investigate specific periods of interest and analyze data effectively. Here's what's included in this update:

- **Dashboard-Level Time Range Override**. When setting a dashboard-level time range, the new time range will now be temporarily applied to all panels displayed on the dashboard. The updated dashboard time range is applied only for the current viewer of the dashboard unless saved as the new dashboard default.  
- **Panel-Level Time Range Override**. We've introduced the ability for users to temporarily override panel-level time ranges, allowing you to customize the time range for individual panels without changing the time range for other viewers of the dashboard. The updated panel time range is applied only for the current viewer of the dashboard unless saved as the new panel default.
- **Time Range Inheritance on Adding Panels**. When adding a panel to an existing dashboard from the **Log Search** page, you'll now have the flexibility to specify whether the new panel inherits the time selection of the query as configured or if it inherits the dashboard-level time range. This gives you more control over how time ranges are applied to the new panel.

See our help documentation [here](/docs/dashboards/set-custom-time-ranges) to learn more about setting time ranges within dashboards and panels.

#### Next-Gen Apps

In response to many requests for better App management, we are happy to announce the release of our new Next-Gen Apps located within a new section of the Applications Catalog. Sumo Logic's next generation of apps introduce features not previously available within Classic Apps and simplifies the management and maintenance of apps. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/#next-gen-apps).

#### Key Features

* Role-based access controls, which ensure that only authorized individuals within your organization can install, uninstall, or update apps. To perform these actions you must be a member of the default Administrator role. Sumo Logic will be providing a new “Manage Apps” role capability soon, which can be used to grant these permissions to additional roles.
* To identify which apps have been installed within your org, Next-Gen app icons will display a badge indicating their installed status.
* When an update to an installed App becomes available, these new apps will provide a badge noting there is an update available. An upgrade can then be applied with a simple click within the App Catalog.  
* Installed apps can be uninstalled and removed through the App Catalog, making it easy to clean up apps you no longer use.  
* Additional filter options make it easy to find your installed or upgradeable apps.
* To support the ability to upgrade and to make app content easier to locate, app content will be installed into a shared “Installed Apps” folder of the Library.
* To support the ability to upgrade and to make sure upgrades do not overwrite any customizations you may apply, the content installed by an app is immutable. If you wish to customize the content you will need to first make a custom copy of the content.

While the initial set of Next-Gen apps is designed to help you get started using the Sumo Logic Distribution of the OpenTelemetry agent, we haven't forgotten about those who'd like to continue sending data through our Installed Collector and Hosted Sources.

Over the coming year, we will be converting all existing Classic Apps to the Next-Gen framework and will continue to provide support for these collection methods. In the meantime, our Classic Apps will remain available to you within the App Catalog.

We'll also be making additional improvements within the Apps Catalog to assist with better search, filtering, upgrade notifications, and management. Stay tuned for these future updates.

### June 28, 2023 (Metrics, Dashboards)

#### Download Visualization as Images and CSV

We've enhanced the flexibility and usability of Metrics and Dashboards with our latest update. You now have the ability to download visualization as images (PNG files) or CSV files, allowing you to copy them to the clipboard as CSV or download CSV files (available only for table visualization).

**Image Downloads**. Download visualization as PNG images directly from the Metrics and Dashboards interface. This feature is available for all types of visualizations, including metric queries, log queries, and spans queries on both the Dashboard and Spans tabs.

**CSV Downloads (Table Visualizations Only)**. Extract the underlying data from the table visualization and download it as CSV files.

**Supported Visualization**. The new download options apply to a wide range of visualization available within Metrics and Dashboards, including:
 * Time Series. Visualize trends and patterns over time with detailed time series charts.
 * Categorical/Distribution. Explore categorical and distribution data using bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and more.
 * Single Value. For single-value visualization, such as key performance indicators (KPIs) or summary statistics, you can now easily download them as images, ensuring the data is readily accessible for presentations or reports.
 * Honeycombs. Download honeycomb visualization as images or CSV files.

:::note
Currently, you can download PNG files for all visualizations except maps, and CSV files are available only for table visualizations. However, in the upcoming releases, CSV download functionality will be extended to cover all types of visualizations.

#### Enhancements to rate and delta Operators

We've added the following enhancements to the `rate` and `delta` operators, elevating the capabilities for analyzing metrics in time series data.

* **Enhanced support to calculate the rate of change**. The rate operator now offers two different modes for calculating the rate of change between data points.
  * **Regular rate mode**. Calculates the rate of change between consecutive data points. It divides the difference in values by the difference in timestamps (in milliseconds) and scales it up to a per-second rate.
  * **Rate Over mode**. Allows you to calculate the average rate of change over a specified time window. It considers the first and last metric values within the given interval, providing insights into metric trends and fluctuations over time.
* **Support for Counters**. Both the `rate` and `delta` operators now support a dedicated counter mode when working with counters. This counter mode accounts for counter resets and ensures that the operators always return non-negative values.
  * In the **rate** operator, use the `rate counter` syntax to calculate the increase in counter value between data points, considering counter resets.
  * In the **delta** operator, use the `delta counter` syntax to determine the difference in counter values between consecutive data points, accounting for counter resets.

Leverage the new features in the `rate` and `delta` operators to make data-driven decisions and gain a detailed understanding of your metrics. Learn more about [`rate`](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/rate) and [`delta`](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/delta) operators.

#### Display Summary Statistics in Legend

We've updated the legend statistics to improve your experience with chart legends and chart tooltips in Time Series visualizations. It lets you visualize aggregate data for your time series. You can simply navigate to the **Legend** section in the **Settings** panel on the right-hand side and choose the desired options from the **Display values** menu.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/legend-stats.png')} alt="legend-stats.png" width="650" />

##### Enhancements & Updates

**Added aggregation statistics options**

When it comes to selecting the statistics you want to display, you have a variety of options to choose from. Here is the list of available aggregation statistics.
1. **Latest** (default). Shows the most recent value.
1. **Average**. Displays the average value.
1. **Min**(default. Shows the minimum value.
1. **Max**(default). Displays the maximum value.
1. **Sum**. Shows the total sum of values.
1. **Count**. Displays the count of data points.

By default, when you create a panel in the **Metrics** view, a default selection of statistics is applied. However, if you are creating a panel in the **Dashboard** view, no default selection will be applied.

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/aggregating-stats.png')} alt="aggregating-stats.png" width="300" />

##### Added display options and sorting functionality

**Display Format**

Now, you have two display formats to choose from: List and Table. Let's take a closer look at how they work.

* **List View**. The statistics are displayed in bold text right after the time series name, giving you a clear and concise overview of your data.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/list-view.png')} alt="legend-stats.png" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="550" />
* **Table View**. The statistics are displayed in separate columns for a structured representation.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/table-view.png')} alt="table-view.png" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="550" />

##### Default Format

* When creating a panel in the **Metrics** view, the default format is **Table**.
* For panels in the **Dashboard** view, the default format is **List**.

##### Rounding

* To enhance readability, statistics values are rounded to 2 significant digits.<br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/rounding.png')} alt="rounding.png" style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} width="450" />
* If you need access to the exact unrounded values, you can find them in the tooltips. <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/metrics/unrounded.png')} style={{border: '1px solid gray'}} alt="unrounded.png" width="450" />

##### Sorting

Sorting your data is now easier than ever.
* In **List** View, time series are sorted based on their names.
* In **Table** View, the default sorting is based on time series names.

Additionally, Table View allows sorting based on statistics. To sort, click on a statistic title in the table header.
 * One click to enable ascending order.
 * Two clicks to enable descending order.
 * Three clicks to disable sorting.
