We’ve released two improvements that ease the processes of administering and monitoring [Sumo Logic Orgs](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-manage-orgs).

* To streamline the child org provisioning process, we added support for auto-provisioning CSE instances for both enterprise and MSSP customers.

* We’ve improved the **Account Overview** page. Now, an admin for a parent org can see detailed usage of Sumo Credits for different product variables, aggregated across child orgs from the start of the contract period. Another nice enhancement: the **Account Overview** page now also presents Promotional Credits consumption.
