Weâ€™ve released an improvement that eases the processes of administering and monitoring [Sumo Logic Orgs](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-manage-orgs). To streamline the child org provisioning process, we added support for auto-provisioning CSE instances for both enterprise and MSSP customers.
