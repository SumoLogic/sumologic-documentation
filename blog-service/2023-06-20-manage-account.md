We’re happy to announce a new security option allowing administrators to set a custom policy for the number of days an API Access Key can go unused before being automatically deactivated. This setting allows administrators to tailor the feature to suit their organization’s specific security requirements. This enhances the security of your account by reducing the risk of unauthorized access through abandoned access keys. This ensures that only active access keys can be used to access your account and its resources.

To access this feature, log in to your account and navigate to **Administration > Security > Policies**. From there, you can set your preferred policy for deactivation of unused access keys. [Learn more](/docs/manage/security/access-keys#edit-deactivate-or-delete-an-access-key).
