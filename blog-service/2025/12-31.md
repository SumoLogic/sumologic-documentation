#### Cloud Syslog Source Certificate Fully Transitioned to ACM

We're excited to announce that Sumo Logic has fully transitioned to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) communication between your cloud syslog sources and Sumo Logic.

In [a previous release note](/release-notes-service/2025/12/31/#august-01-2025-collection), we announced that we are transitioning from DigiCert to ACM certificates.

This change provides the following benefits:
* **Automated certificate renewal and deployment**. ACM eliminates the need for future manual renewals, reducing administrative overhead.
* **Simplified infrastructure management for AWS customers**. ACM is deeply integrated into the AWS ecosystem, streamlining your overall infrastructure management. Because Sumo Logic is also on AWS, using ACM provides a seamless experience.

If you use cloud syslog sources to send data to Sumo Logic, download and configure the ACM certificate on your system. For more information and setup instructions, see:
* [Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source/)
* [rsyslog](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source/rsyslog)
* [syslog-ng](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source/syslog-ng/)
* [Collect Logs for SentinelOne](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-logs-sentinelone/)

To ensure you're informed ahead of time, Scheduled View owners and active account administrators will receive email and in-app notifications 21 days and 7 days before the scheduled pause. If no action is taken, the view will be automatically paused on the 90th day, followed by a final alert. [Learn more](/docs/manage/scheduled-views/pause-disable-scheduled-views/).

### October 15, 2025 (Collection)

#### Snowflake Authentication Update

##### What's changing?

Starting November 2025, Snowflake will block single-factor authentication (password-only sign-ins) as part of their enhanced security protocols.

Snowflake has signed the CISA *Secure by Design* pledge and is committed to adopting security best practices, including:
- Eliminating high-risk authentication methods (for example, password-only access)
- Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Reducing the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access

These changes are designed to strengthen Snowflake’s overall security posture and better protect your data.

##### Next steps

As an interim measure, Sumo Logic recommends you to use the Programmatic Access Tokens (PATs) to authenticate your Sumo Logic integration with Snowflake before 1st November 2025. This ensures continued access and seamless data collection from the Snowflake platform.

Refer to [Using programmatic access tokens for authentication](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) for step-by-step instructions to authenticate the integration with Snowflake.

:::note
- Programmatic Access Tokens (PATs) provide a short-term authentication solution, with each token expiring after approximately one year. So, you must generate a new token annually until a long-term multifactor authentication solution becomes available.
- Sumo Logic is actively developing a long-term authentication solution using OAuth 2.0, which will provide enhanced security and ease of use. More information and rollout timelines for OAuth 2.0 support will be shared in the upcoming release.

### October 01, 2025 (Manage)

#### Change to SAML Group-to-Role Mapping

Sumo Logic has introduced a change to the way group-to-role mapping is handled when performing on-demand role provisioning during SAML authentication. Previously, all groups included in a SAML assertion were validated against roles in Sumo Logic. Going forward, only the groups that match existing roles in Sumo Logic will be applied to the authenticating user. Any non-matching groups will be ignored. Only if no roles match with the groups passed in the assertion will an authentication fail.

For more information about SAML configuration for roles provisioning, see [Configure on-demand roles provisioning](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#configure-on-demand-roles-provisioning).

#### Cloud Syslog Source Certificate Transition to ACM

We're excited to announce that we are transitioning to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates for Transport Layer Security (TLS) communication between your cloud syslog sources and Sumo Logic.

Currently, Sumo Logic uses a DigiCert ALB certificate to secure communication with your cloud syslog sources. This certificate is set to expire on October 13, 2025, at which point Sumo Logic will transition to the ACM root certificates. This change provides the following benefits:
* **Automated certificate renewal and deployment**. ACM eliminates the need for future manual renewals, reducing administrative overhead.
* **Simplified infrastructure management for AWS customers**. ACM is deeply integrated into the AWS ecosystem, streamlining your overall infrastructure management. Because Sumo Logic is also on AWS, using ACM provides a seamless experience.

If you use cloud syslog sources to send data to Sumo Logic, please prepare for this transition by downloading and configuring the ACM certificate on your system. For more information and setup instructions, see:
* [Cloud Syslog Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source/)
* [rsyslog](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-syslog-source/rsyslog)

#### AWS CloudTrail Updates

AWS is streamlining [CloudTrail](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/) events for [IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) to retain only the essential fields needed for audit and incident response workflows. These changes improve user identification and integration with directories like Okta and Microsoft Active Directory, and do not impact CloudTrail events from other AWS services.

- To support this AWS update, Sumo Logic has revised several AWS apps and Cloud SIEM parsers. You are requested to reinstall the affected apps.
- If you use CloudTrail data in the saved searches, dashboards, or detection rules, you are required to update your custom content before AWS enforces the changes on July 14, 2025.

To learn more, see [Important changes to CloudTrail events for AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/modifications-to-aws-cloudtrail-event-data-of-iam-identity-center/).

##### Impact following the AWS CloudTrail updates

AWS is updating CloudTrail events for IAM Identity Center, affecting how user identity data is structured. So, if you are using the updated fields in your Cloud SIEM content or across the Sumo Logic platform, you need to update any saved queries, dashboards, or detection rules to reflect these changes and ensure continued functionality.

Key actions required while updating the AWS CloudTrail include:
- Sumo Logic provided apps must be manually reinstalled to incorporate the updated event field mappings.
- Cloud SIEM parsers have auto-updated and require no customer intervention.

##### Action plan for Sumo Logic users

**Step 1: Reinstall the relevant Sumo Logic apps**

If you're using any of the following apps that consume CloudTrail data, you must reinstall them:
- [Amazon CloudTrail – Cloud Security Monitoring and Analytics](/docs/integrations/cloud-security-monitoring-analytics/aws-cloudtrail/)
- [AWS CloudTrail](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cloudtrail/)
- [CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/)
- [PCI Compliance for AWS CloudTrail](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cloudtrail-pci-compliance/)
- [Threat Intel for AWS](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/threat-intel/)
- [Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS](/docs/security/additional-security-features/cloud-infrastructure-security/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws/)

To reinstall any of the above apps, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **App Catalog**.
1. Search for the relevant app.
1. Install to deploy updated content under a new folder.

:::info
These are Classic apps (V1), and reinstalling them will create a new folder in your Content Library with updated dashboards.
:::

**Step 2: Update the custom saved searches and dashboards**

If you’ve created custom content based on CloudTrail fields, manual field updates as given below will be required to accommodate the new schema:
- Move the `userName` field from the `userIdentity` element to the `additionalEventData` element.
- Remove the `principalId` field from the schema.
- Move the `userId`, `identityStoreArn`, and `credentialId` fields to the `userIdentity` element.

For more information on field changes, see [AWS Security Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/modifications-to-aws-cloudtrail-event-data-of-iam-identity-center/#:~:text=How%20to%20prepare%20your%20workflows%20for%20the%20upcoming%20changes%20to%20IAM%20Identity%20Center%20user%20identification%20in%20CloudTrail).

:::note
AWS plans to implement these enhancements on [July 14, 2025](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/modifications-to-aws-cloudtrail-event-data-of-iam-identity-center/#:~:text=Effective%20July%2014%2C%202025).

Sumo Logic apps are backward-compatible, allowing you to update the apps ahead of time. For any custom content outside of Sumo Logic’s apps or parsers, ensure your changes are backward compatible and deploy updates before July 14, 2025.
:::

##### FAQ

What happens if I don’t update my applications or searches?

Failure to update your apps, saved searches, or dashboards will result in user-related fields not being parsed correctly. Consequently, visualizations and panels relying on those fields will appear empty or display inaccurate data.

#### New UI Becomes the Default Experience at Sign-in (User Interface)

We’re excited to announce the next milestone in our transition to the New UI. Starting today, the New UI will become the default experience when you sign in to Sumo Logic.

The Classic UI will be retired in 2025. The exact date will be communicated closer to the transition. To ensure you have access to the latest features, performance improvements, and innovations, we encourage you to start using the New UI as soon as possible.

## What’s changing?

* **New UI by default**. You will automatically log into the New UI when signing in.  
* **Temporary opt-out**. If your org was created before this change, you can switch back to the Classic UI, and future logins will remember your preference.  
* **New orgs use only the new UI**. If your org was created after this change, the Classic UI will not be available.  
* **MSSP exception**. If your org was created through a parent org, you can still switch to the Classic UI.

## Improvements since initial release

Here's what's changed since the [last rollout](/release-notes-service/2024/12/31/#september-19-2024-user-interface).

* **Faster navigation and performance**. Improved menu loading, collapsible and resizable subnavigation, and persistent menu state across tabs.  
* **More intuitive workflows**. Open/duplicate log searches, drill into Favorites folders, and set a preference to open menu items in new tabs.  
* **New features and enhancements**. Improved keyboard navigation and UI refinements.  
* **Bug fixes**. Improved org switcher, Library search fixes, and other minor UI updates.

### March 03, 2025 (Security)

#### Threat Intelligence

We’re excited to introduce Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence, a powerful feature set that enables Cloud SIEM administrators to seamlessly import indicators of Compromise (IoC) files and feeds directly into Sumo Logic to aid in security analysis. IoCs are individual data points about threats that are gathered from external sources about various entities such as host names, file hashes, IP addresses, and other known targets for compromise.

Once indicators are ingested and appear on the **Threat Intelligence** tab, Cloud SIEM analysts can use the `hasThreatMatch` function in Cloud SIEM rules to analyze incoming records for matches to the threat intelligence indicators.

Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence will help you stay ahead of emerging threats and enhance your security posture.

:::note
Only Cloud SIEM administrators can add threat intelligence indicators to the datastore.
