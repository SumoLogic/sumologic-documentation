We have reintroduced the ability to perform actions on content items directly from navigation menus in the new UI. You can now manage content more quickly without needing to open the Content Library first.

This enhancement reduces the number of clicks required to manage content, helping you work more efficiently and streamline everyday workflows. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui) about our UI.

## What’s new

* **Access actions from navigation menus**. Perform actions directly from Recent, Library, and other navigation areas.
* **Edit content quickly**. Open and modify items without additional navigation steps.
* **Delete without switching context**. Remove content directly from where you are working.
* **Move items easily**. Relocate content between folders without leaving the current view.
* **Share and export faster**. Access common management options from the same menu.
