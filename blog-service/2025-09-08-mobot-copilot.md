We're introducing an update to Sumo Logic's conversational search experience.

As part of this release, Copilot is being renamed to *Mobot* for orgs that opt into the new *multi-turn conversations* Beta.

Multi-turn conversations makes investigations more natural by letting you refine queries through follow-up questions without starting over.  

### Copilot is now Mobot (for orgs with Multi-Turn enabled)

As part of the Multi-Turn Conversations Beta, we've renamed **Copilot**, Sumo Logic's AI-powered log search query assistant, to *Mobot*.

The new Mobot name and experience are only visible in orgs that have opted into the multi-turn Beta. All other customers will continue to see *Copilot* until general availability.  

### Multi-turn conversations (Beta)

Multi-turn conversations let you ask follow-up questions without repeating your search context, making investigations more natural and iterative.  

Enhancements in Beta include:  

* **Clarifications when needed**. If your request is ambiguous, Mobot may ask a follow-up question to narrow intent.  
* **Contextual error handling**. Clear error messages explain why a query failed and suggest fixes.  
* **Guided exploration**. Intent cards summarize your goal, while suggestion cards offer refinements with a click.  
* **Conversation pane**. See your prompts, refinements, and results in one place, with history you can revisit or branch from.  
* **Dashboard-aware translations via RAG**. Mobot references recent dashboard queries to improve accuracy.  

:::note
Multi-turn conversations (and the Mobot name) are only available in orgs that have opted into this Beta. To request access, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or Support.
