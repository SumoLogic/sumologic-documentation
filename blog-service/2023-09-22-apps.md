We're excited to announce the release of the new Heroku app for Sumo Logic. This app is used to monitor Heroku applications with preconfigured dashboards that provide insights into request timings, error trends, and memory utilization to monitor Heroku infrastructure, applications, metrics, and error scenarios.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/web-servers/heroku/) to learn how to set up and use our Heroku app.
