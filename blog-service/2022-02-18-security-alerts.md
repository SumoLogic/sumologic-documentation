#### Security

Update - We’ve eased the process of offboarding Sumo Logic users. Now, when you delete a user’s Sumo Logic account, you can transfer the user’s [Monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors) to another user, along with folders, searches, scheduled searches, scheduled views, monitors, and dashboards. For more information, see [Delete a User](https://help.sumologic.com/manage/users-roles/users/delete-user).

#### Monitors

Update - The [Monitors page](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors) has a new shortcut to quickly view triggered alerts from a Monitor. Hover your cursor over the Status column of a Monitor and click the icon to open [Alert List](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors/Alert-Response#Alert-List).
