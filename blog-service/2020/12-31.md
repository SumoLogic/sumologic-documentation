## December 28, 2020 (Search)

New - Search can parse JSON logs automatically with [Dynamic Parsing](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/dynamic-parsing). Now you don't have to write parse expressions or update queries if your log schema changes.

---
## December 22, 2020 (Manage)

Update - We've brought you greater control over your data: now you can update an existing partition's routing expression, which determines what data goes into the partition. (You have to be a Sumo Logic admin or have the Manage Partitions role capability.) 

Changing the scope of a partition is useful if you simply want to route more or less data to an existing partition. Better yet, it allows you to re-route some or all of the data in an existing partition to a different Data Tier than the one it currently resides in. If you decide that some of the data in a partition belongs in a different tier than the one currently configured, you can edit the scope of that partition to exclude that data, and create a new partition for it that targets the desired tier.

For more information, see [Edit a Partition](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/create-edit-partition).

## December 21, 2020 (Apps)

Update - The [CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection](/docs/integrations/security-threat-detection/crowdstrike-falcon-endpoint-protection) App has been updated to include a new dashboard to provide visibility into Falcon incidents. All dashboards have been updated to use the new dashboard platform. This app uses the [new CrowdStrike Source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/crowdstrike-source) to collect log data from the CrowdStrike Falcon Endpoint Protection platform.

---
## December 8, 2020 (Apps)

Update - [F5 - BIG-IP LTM](/docs/integrations/security-threat-detection/f5-big-ip-ltm) App now uses [Telemetry Streaming](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-telemetry-streaming/latest) to collect log data from F5 - BIG-IP LTM.

You can now easily [link dashboards](/docs/dashboards/link-dashboards) together to quickly view related data. Each panel can have links to other dashboards. Links have options to include metadata and time range. When viewing the summary tab on a panel with linked dashboards you'll have the option to [select from linked dashboards](/docs/dashboards).

---
## November 13, 2020 (Search)

Update - We're pleased to announce a improved search experience for [Data Tier](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/data-tiers) users. You can use the new [`_dataTier`](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/searching-data-tiers) search modifier to restrict a log search to a particular Data Tier (Continuous/Frequent/Infrequent). For more information, see [Searching Data Tiers](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/searching-data-tiers). 

---
## November 13, 2020 (Security)

New - If you have multiple Sumo Logic accounts, we've got good news for you: we've introduced [custom Sumo Logic subdomains](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/manage-org-settings). By default, the subdomain in the URL for accessing Sumo Logic is "service", like this:

`service.sumologic.com`

Multiple orgs with identical domain names can result in authentication headaches. Now, your account owner can replace the "service" subdomain for each of your orgs with a distinct subdomain. For example:

`west1.sumologic.com`

Then, the links that Sumo Logic generates, for example, when you share queries or dashboards, will contain your custom subdomain. These subdomain-enabled links will direct the user to the correct account for authentication.  

When subdomains are enabled for an org, you'll see your SAML SP-initiated login options on the Sumo Logic login page.

## November 13, 2020 (Apps)

New - [Sumo Logic AWS Lambda extension](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-aws-lambda-logs-extension) enables you to get instant visibility into the health and performance of your mission-critical applications using AWS Lambda. With this extension and Sumo Logic's continuous intelligence platform, you can now ensure that all your Lambda functions are running as expected by analyzing function, platform, and extension logs to quickly identify and remediate errors and exceptions.

---
## November 05, 2020 (Collection)

New - We're thrilled to announce our new [Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework).

The Cloud-to-Cloud Integration framework is an extensible system for running fully hosted, pull, and pub-sub based sources. Traditionally, Sumo Logic collection has been push-based, where we expose an endpoint to which data sources or collector agents push data to us. However, many SaaS applications and Cloud Providers expose event data that describe user, system/application activity which is critical for operations monitoring, security, and compliance use cases. The Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework is the system by which we provide integrations to these sources and SaaS applications.

This release comes with two new Sources, [Okta](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/okta-source) and [Netskope](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/netskope-source). Our existing apps are updated to work with these two new Sources.

The Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework is an extensible architecture, in which new Sources can be easily added in the future. Check out the [Sources we have available in beta](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework).

## November 05, 2020 (Apps)

Update - We're happy to announce that the updated version of Sumo Logic App for [Azure WebApp](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/web-apps) is compatible with the new [Azure Monitor based Collection](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/web-apps).

---
## October 30, 2020 (Security)

New - We're pleased to announce a new role capability that allows a Sumo Logic admin to limit the ability of users to create Access Keys. Currently, all Sumo Logic users can create Access Keys on the **Preferences** page. [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys) allow a user to register collectors and to use Sumo Logic APIs.) With the new **Create Access Keys** capability, you can limit the ability to create Access Keys to only those roles that require it. Note that, with this update, all roles in your Sumo account have the **Create Access Keys** capability. To restrict access, your Sumo Logic administrator can remove the capability from roles that do not require it. 

New - We've released a new security policy you can use to set a maximum timeout for Sumo Logic UI web sessions. Sumo Logic users can set their web session timeout on the **Preferences** page, up to a maximum of 7 days. If you are a Sumo Logic admin with the **Manage Organizational Settings** role capability, you can now specify the maximum web session timeout period that users in your org can select. For more information, see [Set a Maximum Web Session Timeout](/docs/manage/security/set-max-web-session-timeout).

## October 28, 2020 (Search)

Update - Just wanted to let you know that we've made an underlying change to our [XML Parsing](/docs/search/search-query-language/parse-operators) library for parsing XML-formatted logs. The following minor behavioral chances will change how results are returned from parsing XML log:

1. Empty nodes will be returned as self closing tags

For example - Consider the following xml log line (see last empty tag)\
`<users><user id="emptytag" role="manager"><first_name>Sally</first_name><last_name>Jones</last_name><email>sally@emailplace.com</email></user><user id="456" role="contributor"><first_name>Bob</first_name><last_name>Smith</last_name><email>bob@emailplace.com</email></user><user></user></users>`

Query:
```
_sourceCategory=stag/xmltest ("678" or "emptytag")
| limit 5
| parse xml "/users/user[3]" as first_name nodrop
```

**Old lib **would return <user></user>\
**New lib** would return <user />\
2. Extra spaces in XML tags will be trimmed.

For example - Consider the following xml log line (see the extra space in yellow)
```
<users><user id="678" role="manager"><first_name>Sally</first_name><last_name>Jones</last_name><email>sally@emailplace.com</email></user><user          id="456" role="contributor"><first_name>Bob</first_name><last_name>Smith</last_name><email>bob@emailplace.com</email></user></users>
```

Query:
```
<code>-sourceCategory=stag/xmltest ("678" or "emptytag")\
| limit 5
| parse xml "/users/user[2]" as first_name nodrop
```

**Old lib** would return:
```
<user id="456" role="contributor"><first_name>Bob</first_name><last_name>Smith</last_name><email>bob@emailplace.com</email></user>
```

**New lib** would return: 
```
<user id="456" role="contributor"><first_name>Bob</first_name><last_name>Smith</last_name><email>bob@emailplace.com</email></user><code>
```

## October 23, 2020 (Observability)

Update - We have rolled out audit logging support for [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors). Create, read, update, and delete operations of Monitors are logged in the Audit Event Index.

---
## October 23, 2020 (Apps)

New - We're happy to announce the [Windows JSON](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/windows-json) App based on the JSON event log format and provides insight into the operations of the Windows system operation and events so that you can better manage and maintain your environment. The Windows JSON App is based on the JSON Windows event log format and consists of predefined searches and dashboards that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage of Security Status, System Activity, Updates, User Activity, and Applications.
<!---
![Windows_Overview.png /files/10238/Windows_Overview.png?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=601)

## October 21, 2020 (Manage)

Update - [Webhook payload variables](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections) need to be in mustache format. You do this by wrapping each variable in double curly brackets, like `{{variable}}`. In February 2018 we introduced this format. We did not deprecate the previous format using a dollar sign, like `$variable`. Going forward, we will only support mustache format.

:::note
The US1 and US2 [deployments](/docs/api/troubleshooting) are scheduled to have this update next week.
:::

This change was communicated to administrators of accounts still using the old format. Any existing alerts using the old format have been automatically switched to the new format.

---
## October 21, 2020 (Metrics)

Change - We made some nice changes to our approach to disabling metric sources that generate too many unique time series. Instead of completely disabling a noisy metric source, we take a more fine-grained approach by dropping the offending dimension or dimensions.

Also, we've implemented a global limit for unique time series, across all your metric sources. That gives you some wiggle room---you can have some metric sources that generate lots of unique time series, and as long as the volume across all your metric sources doesn't exceed the global limit, you're good. If you are leveraging [Short Term retention](/docs/metrics/metrics-transformation-rules) in [Transformation Rules](/docs/metrics/metrics-transformation-rules), you also get significantly higher capacity on the cardinality before being impacted.

Finally, we've increased the limit of unique time series a Logs-to-Metrics rule can produce. For more information, see [Disabled Metric Sources ](/docs/metrics/manage-metric-volume/disabled-metrics-sources)and [Logs-to-Metrics](/docs/metrics/logs-to-metrics).

---
## October 20, 2020 (Search)

New - We're happy to announce the release of new and improved [Lookup Tables](/docs/search/lookup-tables). We've improved performance, increased the allowable table size, and made Lookup Tables easier to create and manage. You can populate a Lookup Table by uploading a .csv file, using the save operator, or using the new [Save to Lookup](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/save-to-lookup) option when you schedule a search. Lookup Tables are now a first-class content item: you can view and share them from the Sumo Logic Library. To top it off, we've provided new versions of the save and lookup operators, plus two brand new operators: [lookupContains](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/lookupcontains) and [cat](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/cat).  
<!---
![image1.png /files/3921/image1.png?revision=8&size=bestfit&height=325)
-->
This is the first of many cool updates as we build a new Lookups framework that is intuitive, performant and flexible to support both operational and security analytics use cases.

**Availability** New Lookup Tables are available in all deployments except Sumo Logic's Montreal deployment, pending AWS providing a required AWS service in the Montreal region.

---
## October 19, 2020 (Manage)

New - [Jira](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/jira-cloud) and [Opsgenie](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/opsgenie) webhook connections are now available. 

- Opsgenie connections allow you to create incidents based on Sumo Logic alerts within Opsgenie.
- Jira connections allow you to create Jira tickets based on Sumo Logic alerts in Jira Server, Jira Cloud, and Jira Service Desk.

Sumo Logic Observability can help you:

- **Monitor **critical indicators of reliability such as errors or latency. 
- **Diagnose** or isolate services or resources that might be the immediate cause of reliability issues.
- **Troubleshoot** and uncover root cause(s) to guide recovery as well as on-going application reliability.

As it relates to **monitoring**, the Observability solution now includes:

- [**Unified Alerting**](/docs/alerts), across logs and metrics data sources with the ability to specify alert criticality, configure detection rules, set up multiple channels for receiving notifications,  auto-resolve incidents, and a central landing page to triage, administer and manage alerts.

- [**AWS Observability**](/docs/observability/aws) features 40+ dashboards to monitor infrastructure on AWS in a comprehensive and intuitive manner across AWS accounts, regions and resource types down to individual entities.
<!---
![image2.png /files/5644/image2.png?revision=3&size=bestfit&width=602&height=351)
-->
**Diagnosing** incidents just got easier with:

- [**Transaction Tracing**](/docs/apm/traces)to observe apps and microservices to the level of individual requests and pinpoint issues with particular microservices. Our OpenTelemetry standard based tracing capabilities provide an open and flexible standard for observability of microservices transactions without vendor lock-in.  If your service package capabilities have been upgraded to include Tracing, you should see a "Tracing" tab available in your Sumo Logic UI. To start using Tracing or taking advantage of our promotion (90 days worth of trial capacity for free), contact your Sumo representative to activate.
<!---
    ![image3.png /files/3734/image3.png?revision=4&size=bestfit&width=612&height=249)
-->
- [Re-vamped Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer) that decreases the complexity of finding and visualizing your metrics data with a new structured query builder, and an extended range of visualizations for ad-hoc analysis. Mimicking the Dashboard workflow, you now have the same unified experience in the main metrics tab.
- [Global Intelligence for AWS CloudTrail DevOps](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/global-intelligence-cloudtrail-devops) that helps on-call staff isolate or eliminate AWS errors (availability, throttling, out of stock) as probable cause for their incidents. Available for Enterprise accounts. 

**Troubleshooting** incidents can now be streamlined thanks to:

- [**Root Cause Explorer**](/docs/observability/root-cause-explorer), an AIOps breakthrough that helps on-call staff accelerate troubleshooting and root cause isolation for incidents in their apps and microservices running on AWS by detecting anomalies in 500+ AWS CloudWatch metrics and automatically categorizes anomalies by incident timeline, AWS account, region, namespace, entities, AWS tags, and more dimensions. This is not enabled by default in your account, and requires you to install the AWS Observability solution, and be an Enterprise account holder.
<!---
    ![image1.png /files/3921/image1.png?revision=8&size=bestfit&width=602&height=329)
-->
- [**Behavior Insights**](/docs/search/behavior-insights) leverages machine learning to detect patterns, outliers, and changes in underlying service behavior to isolate and automatically explain the root causes of application issues.

Underneath these capabilities is expanded support for Open Source frameworks including OpenTelemetry for tracing data and [Telegraf](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/collect-metrics-telegraf) for increasing the breadth of technologies we collect metrics from.

New - Behavior Insights comes with three new log search operators to accelerate insights, troubleshooting, and action plans using structured logs. Behavior Insights helps answer the following questions:

- What activity patterns are evident from structured logs?
- What patterns are trending?
- Which groups of users, apps, services, or resources are responsible for regular and irregular activity in logs?

Modeled after [LogReduce](/docs/search/logreduce), the new operator [LogReduce Keys](/docs/search/behavior-insights/logreduce-keys) clusters JSON logs based on keys providing an at-a-glance summary of patterns in logs based on their schema while ignoring specific values. The new operator [LogReduce Values](/docs/search/behavior-insights/logreduce-values) clusters JSON logs based on the values of keys.

The third Behavior Insights operator, [LogExplain](/docs/search/behavior-insights/logexplain), finds the root cause of outliers in logs based on conditions you specify.

New - [Archive](/docs/manage/data-archiving/archive) lets you forward log data from Installed Collectors to AWS S3 buckets to collect at a later time. If you have logs that you don't need to search immediately, you can archive them for later and ingest them on-demand with hourly granularity.

The key new components provided are:

- An AWS Archive Destination that lets you set up your AWS S3 buckets as archive destinations.
- A Processing Rule type, "Archive messages that match" that archives log data with Installed Collector Sources.
- An AWS S3 Archive Source to ingest data from an Archive destination.
- An Archive page to view all the AWS S3 Archive Sources and ingestion jobs in your account, as well as creating ingestion jobs.

## July 7, 2020 (Security)

New - Sharing is good, over-sharing, not so much. So, we've added a new security policy you can use to ensure that shared dashboards don't display data that users they're shared with shouldn't see. The new policy is [Data Access Level for Shared Dashboards](/docs/manage/security/data-access-level-shared-dashboards). If your role grants you the "Manage organization settings" [capability](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities), you can enable the new policy on the **Manage > Security > Policies** page. By default, once you enable this policy, any newly-created dashboards will run under the role search filter of the users it is shared with.

Also with the goal of giving you better control of your data, we've introduced a new role capability: "Change Data Access Level of Dashboards". Users with this capability can change the data access level of dashboards that are shared with them with edit or manage permission.

This metric operator comes in handy for metric data sets in which some timeslices contain no data points. You can use `fillmissing` in a metric query to fill empty time slices in metric query results with a derived data point. You can choose between several methods of deriving a data point, or leave empty timeslices empty.

## June 15, 2020 (Security)

Update - By popular demand, we've made some changes to the [capabilities](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities) you can assign to roles in Sumo Logic. Our goal was to give you more fine-grained control of Sumo functionality when you set up roles. Here's what we did:

- We replaced the Manage Indexes capability with four new capabilities: View Partitions, Manage Partitions, View Scheduled Views, and Manage Scheduled Views. Any existing role that previously had the Manage Index capability now has four new capabilities.
- We provided new capabilities that you can use to provide view-only access to Field Extraction Rules.  
- We added two capabilities related the Fields feature: View Fields and Manage Fields.

So what do you need to do because of this change? There's nothing you have to do. However, if you'd like to let users view information about resources like Partitions, Scheduled Views, Fields, and Field Extraction Rules without letting them change them, you can easily accomplish that with the new view-only capabilities.

## June 15, 2020 (Search)

Update - [Scheduled Search](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/schedule-search) no longer permits Static Time ranges to be set when scheduling a search. You must choose a relative time range, This is to ensure the longevity of your scheduled searches and to help you get useful results.

New - We are pleased to announce [Global Intelligence for AWS CloudTrail DevOps](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/global-intelligence-cloudtrail-devops), which guides infrastructure engineers, on-call staff and DevOps users to accelerate root cause analysis for incidents through error rate and configuration insights benchmarked from our AWS customers for the following AWS services:

- EC2
- Lambda
- Auto Scaling
- S3
- ELB
- RDS
- DynamoDB
- ElastiCache
- Redshift

The benchmarks rely on 15 million data points per week from AWS CloudTrail logs and baseline service availability, throttling, account quota and insufficient capacity/out-of-stock errors in 27 AWS regions by AWS service, API, account, and instance type. The app recommends configuration improvements to key AWS services based on baseline usage such as memory and concurrency settings for AWS Lambda, provisioned IOPS for DynamoDB and min/max sizes of EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

## May 21, 2020 (Collection)

New - We have [Extended HTTP Metadata Collection](/docs/manage/fields#HTTP-source_fields) capabilities. HTTP Sources receiving log data can now process headers into metadata fields.

New - Kubernetes Collection 1.0.0 introduces multiple enhancements to the collection process.

- Standardized and reorganized the configuration options in the values.yaml for clarity and ease of use.
- Exposed full control of the Fluentd pipeline with values.yaml which allows you to easily extend the collection process. You can fork data to multiple destinations, add custom log sources, and attach additional filters to the Fluentd pipeline.
- Reduced the default collected metrics to only what the Kubernetes apps require.
- Split the FluentD Deployment into two StatefulSets, one for logs and one for metrics. This change enables better use of persistent volumes and improved buffering.
- Falco has been disabled with an upgrade to a more recent version which disables the BitCoin mining rule that affected AWS GuardDuty users. We have also disabled Falco by default while we work through the incompatibilities with certain operating systems.

You can read more about the changes in our [migration docs](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/tree/main/docs).

Since this is a breaking change if you're running earlier versions of collection, we have provided a [migration guide and migration script docs](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-kubernetes-collection/tree/main/docs) to make it much easier for you to upgrade to this release.

New - We added a new [role capability](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities) you can use to control access to the Account Overview page in Sumo Logic. Previously, any Sumo user had view-only access to this page. The new capability is **View Account Overview,** and your Account Owner, and users with the Admin role now have it. Your Sumo administrator can assign the capability to other users or roles, as desired. Because users without the capability won't be able to see the Account Overview page, where your Organization ID is shown, we've updated the **Preferences **page in the Sumo Logic UI to also display your Organization ID. That way, users who can't view the Account Overview page can find your Organization ID, useful when dealing with Sumo Support. 

If you previously had access to the Account Overview page and need the information it contains, contact your Sumo administrator to obtain access.

Sumo Logic now supports [collection from AWS GovCloud](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/collection-aws-govcloud) regions. AWS GovCloud is a set of specific regions authorized to a FedRAMP-High baseline. GovCloud regions meet higher regulatory and compliance requirements set by government agencies and U.S. customers that manage sensitive data in the cloud. These regions are where users with strict compliance requirements ---## May operate in adherence with ITAR, FedRAMP, and DoD requirements. Users of Sumo Logic can now collect logs and metrics from AWS services and sources running with GovCloud, assuring that customers can continue to meet their regulatory requirements while using our Operational Intelligence Platform.

While Sumo Logic does provide collection of logs and metrics from GovCloud regions, Sumo Logic does not itself run in AWS GovCloud. Be aware, collection of data from AWS GovCloud means logs, metrics, and data will be leaving a FedRAMP-high environment. For this reason, we recommend that customers with elevated compliance and regulatory requirements use our FedRamp deployment.
