We've introduced three new features to improve your Copilot experience:  

### Dynamic Conversation Titles

Copilot now automatically updates conversation titles based on your query, making it easier to track and revisit past investigations. You can also customize it by clicking the pencil icon next to the title.  

* **Better organization**. Conversations now have meaningful names for easy navigation.  
* **Faster troubleshooting**. Quickly find and resume previous investigations.  
* **More control**. Rename conversations to match your workflow.  


### "Open in Copilot" for Alerts

We've added an **Open in Copilot** button to the Alert Response page, allowing you to troubleshoot alerts directly in Copilot. This preserves the alert context, making it seamless to investigate and resolve issues.

* **Faster root cause analysis**. Jump into Copilot instantly from an alert.  
* **Context-aware troubleshooting**. Maintain alert details while searching logs.  


### Suggestion Pinning

Now you can pin Copilot suggestions for easy reference. Just hover over a suggestion and click the pin icon to save it within your conversation.

* **Quick access**. Keep important suggestions handy for ongoing investigations.  
* **Improved workflow**. No need to scroll back to find key recommendations.
