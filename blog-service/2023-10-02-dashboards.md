Effective today, Sumo Logic has removed the ability to create or copy Classic Dashboards from within Sumo Logic. We understand that you may have existing classic dashboards that you may still need to access and use. To make this transition as seamless as possible, we have implemented the following:

- **Automatic Migration**. If you have edit permissions to a classic dashboard, when you open the dashboard we will automatically create a new copy of the dashboard.
- **Choice of Version**. Once your classic dashboard has been migrated, when opening a classic dashboard we will provide you the option to open the new version of the dashboard or continue with the classic version.  

Once you have had a chance to review the new dashboard, we recommend that you delete the classic version of the dashboard.

On January 8, 2024, Sumo Logic will no longer support the viewing of classic dashboards and will begin a process to auto migrate your remaining classic dashboards. Please note that this migration may take a little time, so you may still encounter classic dashboards within your account during this period. Here is what you can expect beginning January 8: 

- **Automatic Migration**. When opening a classic dashboard from the Library or via a previously shared link, the classic dashboard will be automatically migrated and you will be redirected to the new version of that dashboard. 
- **Library Clean Up**. Once a classic dashboard has been successfully migrated to a new dashboard, it will be automatically removed from your Library.
