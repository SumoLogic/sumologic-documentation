We're excited to announce the release of our new cloud-to-cloud source for Snowflake Logs. This source aims to collect the row data from the supported global tables (`QUERY_HISTORY`, `LOGIN_HISTORY`, `SESSIONS`, `GRANTS_TO_USERS`, `DATA_TRANSFER_HISTORY`, `STAGES`, and Custom Events) from the Snowflake platform and send them to Sumo Logic for streamlined analysis.
