We're happy to announce that our **Account Overview** page is updated and now you can get a unified view of child org level usage. Here are some of the key features that this update offers:

- Monitor child org usage data seamlessly through the new centralized view for child orgs usages or the APIs.
- Gain a comprehensive picture of child org credit consumption and usage trends in one place.
- Navigate to individual child org accounts pages directly from the centralized UI for deeper insights.

For more information, see our documentation on how to [monitor credits allocation and usage](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-manage-orgs/#monitor-credits-allocation-and-usage).
