#### Manage

Update - Weâ€™ve made an improvement to the [Sumo Logic Organizations](https://help.sumologic.com/manage/Manage-Subscription/Create-Manage-Orgs) (Sumo Orgs) feature, which allows you to create, provision, and manage multiple "child" orgs from a "parent" org. Now, when you provision a child org, you can allocate credits for [trace](https://help.sumologic.com/apm/traces) ingestion, as well as log and metric ingestion.
