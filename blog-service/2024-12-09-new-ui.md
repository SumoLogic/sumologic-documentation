We're excited to share some updates to the new UI based on feedback we've received from our customers. These updates were implemented to enhance your navigation experience and improve your workflow.

- **Faster Library Navigation**. The loading time of the Library navigation has been significantly improved, reducing wait times as you navigate this menu.
- **Tree Position Memory**. The Library navigation now remembers where you left off within the tree structure, making it easier to return to your exact spot when re-opening the subnavigation.
- **Remembered Menu State**. The expand/collapse state of the navigation menu is now preserved when opening new tabs, giving you a consistent experience across multiple browser tabs.
- **Pin Subnavigation**. You can now “pin” a subnavigation menu to keep it open while working within a specific feature area, giving you quicker access to what you need.
- **Resizable Submenu**. Widen the submenu to better view content items with longer names.

You can try the new UI by selecting the "Switch to New UI" link within the Classic UI menu.
