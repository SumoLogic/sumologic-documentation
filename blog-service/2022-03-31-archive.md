### March 15, 2022 (Traces)

We are proud to announce general availability of extended trace filtering capabilities. This allows you to search for traces by any existing and new metadata, including your custom ones without a need to add this to the configuration or knowing this upfront, before you start ingesting data. Just add any metadata tag to your spans and, as long as its cardinality within a trace is not too high, you will be able to filter by it right away in your Traces UI. See [View and Investigate Traces](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces) for more information.
