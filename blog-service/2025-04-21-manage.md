We’ve made it even easier to access Sumo Logic: you can now sign in using your Google account credentials.

If your email address is linked to a Google account, just click **Continue with Google** on the sign-in page to authenticate. No setup required.

You can also use Google SSO when signing up for a new Sumo Logic account.

Organizations using SAML or other identity providers will continue to sign in as usual.
