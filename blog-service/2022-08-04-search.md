Update - We’re preparing to release a new UI for creating and managing [Scheduled Views](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/Scheduled-Views). The rollout will commence the week of August 8, 2022. The new interface is clean and compact—now you'll be able to configure a new Scheduled View in a right-hand pane that appears next to the list of existing Scheduled Views.
