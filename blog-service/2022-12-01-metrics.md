As of December 1, 2022, metrics ingested to Sumo Logic must include the `metric` dimension.

If you send metrics without the `metric` dimension, Sumo Logic will ingest them, and set the `metric` dimension value to *undefined*. We plan to deprecate and filter these metrics at a later date.

There are benefits to including the `metric` dimension: it improves the structure of queries, dashboards, and monitors. In addition, the presence of the `metric` dimension can significantly improve query latency and monitor evaluation time.
