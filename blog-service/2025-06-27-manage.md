We're happy to include the **Timezone** section for the Scheduled Views. Previously, *America/Los_Angeles (Includes DST)* was considered as the default timezone, going forward you can select the timezone of your choice. If you do not make a selection, the Scheduled View will default to the time zone from your browser.
