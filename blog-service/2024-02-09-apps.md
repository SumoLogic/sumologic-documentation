We're happy to announce an update of the Azure Blob Storage collection framework. Here are some of the key features that this update offers:

- Aligns all the components to the latest version of Azure Functions runtime and libraries.
- Replaces the soon-to-be deprecated classic application insights resource with new workspace-based application insights.
- Updated function application logging with log levels.
- Provides necessary security updates.

For details on upgrade instructions, refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-azure-function/releases/tag/v4.0.0). Also, for more information on metrics collection from Azure Monitor, see our [documentation](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-blob-storage/collect-logs-azure-blob-storage/).
