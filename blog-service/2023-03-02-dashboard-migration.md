Beta - To prepare for Dashboards (Classic) deprecation in late 2023, we've released a tool to assist you with migrating from Dashboards (Classic) to Dashboards (New). You can access this tool directly from a Classic dashboard page by clicking on the **Migrate to new dashboards** link at the top of the page.

For more information, including the current limitations of the tool, see [Migrate Dashboards](/docs/dashboards/dashboards-migration). Start planning and migrating your Classic dashboards now. You can learn more from [our Community page](https://support.sumologic.com/hc/en-us/articles/12796506964247-All-aboard-Moving-forward-with-Sumo-Logic-s-new-dashboards).
