An automatic migration tool is now in Beta. It is available to assist you with Classic dashboard migration.  This tool can be accessed directly from a Classic dashboard page by clicking on the **Migrate to new dashboards** link toward the top of the page.

For more information, including the current limitations of the tool, see [Migrate Dashboards](/docs/dashboards-new/migrate-to-new-dashboards).  We will deprecate Classic dashboard in the second half of 2023.  Start planning and migrating your Classic dashboards now.
