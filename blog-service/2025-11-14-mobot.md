Mobot has been updated for Beta customers and now appears as two specialized agents designed to make natural-language interactions clearer and more effective:

* **Query Agent** helps you create and refine log search queries using natural language.
* **Knowledge Agent** answers how-to questions about Sumo Logic using official documentation.

Mobot remains your conversational interface for Sumo Logic — simply ask questions and get actionable results without writing syntax or hunting through docs. Query Agent focuses on data investigation, while Knowledge Agent focuses on product guidance. Together, they help you troubleshoot faster, explore data more intuitively, and learn the platform without friction.

Only Mobot Beta customers will see this update.
