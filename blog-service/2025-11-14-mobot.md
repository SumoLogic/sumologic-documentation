Mobot....


We’re introducing **Mobot**, Sumo Logic’s new conversational UI for log search, and updating the product name from *Copilot* to *Mobot*. [Learn more](/docs/search/mobot-multiturn-beta).

The new conversational experience lets you ask follow-up questions without repeating your search context, making investigations more natural and iterative.

Enhancements include:

* **Dashboard-aware translations (retrieval-augmented generation, RAG)**. Mobot references recent dashboard queries to improve accuracy.
* **Conversation pane**. See your prompts, refinements, and results in one place, with history you can revisit or branch from.
* **Guided exploration**. Intent cards summarize your goal, and suggestion cards offer refinements with a click.
* **Context-aware clarifications and error guidance**. If a request is ambiguous or fails, Mobot asks follow-up questions and suggests fixes to get you back on track.
* **Log search canvas mode**. A focused workspace for deeper investigations that keeps context together while you pivot, refine, and compare results.

### Availability and rollout

As part of a staggered Beta rollout, Mobot*.

The Mobot name and experience are available only in organizations included in this Beta.

All other customers will only see QA until general availability.

:::note Name update
During the transition, some UI labels and screenshots may still show *Copilot*. Functionality is unchanged.
