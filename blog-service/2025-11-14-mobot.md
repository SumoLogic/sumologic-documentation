Mobot has been updated for Beta customers and now appears as two separate agents:

* **Query Agent**. Helps you create and refine log search queries using natural language.
* **Knowledge Agent**. Answers how-to questions about Sumo Logic using official documentation.

This change makes it easier to pick the right assistant for the task. All existing Mobot functionality remains available, now organized more clearly. [Learn more](/docs/search/mobot-multiturn-beta).

NOTE: Only Mobot beta customers will see this update.
