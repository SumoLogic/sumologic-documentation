#### Manage

Update - Weâ€™ve released an improved, re-organized UI for Data Forwarding. There are now separate pages for managing different types of data forwarding destinations:  

* Destinations that receive data forwarded from Sumo Logic partitions or scheduled views are still managed on the **Manage Data > Logs > Data Forwarding** page.
* Destinations that receive data from Installed Collectors are managed on a new page: **Manage Data > Collection > Data Archiving** page.

For more information see [Forward Data from Sumo Logic to S3](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/data-forwarding/amazon-s3-bucket.md) and [Forward Data from an Installed Collector](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/data-forwarding/installed-collectors.md).
