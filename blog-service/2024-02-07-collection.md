We're happy to announce an update of the Azure metric collection framework. Here are some of the key features that this update offers:

- Aligns all the components to the latest version of Azure Functions runtime and libraries. 
- Replaces the soon-to-be deprecated classic Application insights resource with new workspace-based Application insights.
- Provides necessary security updates.

[Refer here](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-azure-function/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for details on upgrade instructions and changelog.
