We're excited to announce the release of the new Symantec Web Security Service app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic's [Cloud-to-Cloud Symantec Web Security Service source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/symantec-web-security-service-source/) to provide real-time insights into the web traffic and helps you to identify potential security threats. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Monitor for web-based threats**. Monitor the web traffic for potential threats using access logs generated by the Symantec Web Security Service.
- **Detect and prevent malware infections**. Search access logs for patterns of behavior that are indicative of malware infections.
- **Identify and block suspicious web activity**. Monitor suspicious web activity, such as requests to known malicious sites.
- **Optimize web security policies**. Identify areas where policies may be too restrictive or too permissive and make adjustments accordingly.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/symantec-web-security-service) to learn how you can set up and use the Symantec Web Security Service App for Sumo Logic.
