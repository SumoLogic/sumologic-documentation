You can now use Copilot to analyze raw, unstructured log data, even if it’s not in JSON or lacks Field Extraction Rules (FERs). This Beta expands Copilot’s reach to custom, legacy, and inconsistent log formats with no setup required.

* Ask questions in plain English—no schema or FERs needed.
* Works with raw logs like firewalls, syslog, and homegrown formats.
* Ideal for error triage, threat hunting, and exploratory analysis.
