As part of the phased deprecation of our [Free plan](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/sumo-logic-flex-accounts), Sumo Logic trial accounts created after \[DATE] will have data ingestion reduced to zero after the 30-day trial ends.

### What’s changing

* **Days 0–30**. Full access to ingest data, create dashboards, search logs, set up alerts, and explore the platform.
* **Days 31–37**. Ingestion stops. You can continue querying existing data for 7 days, subject to retention.
* **Days 38–68**. Access to Kickstart Data remains, allowing continued platform exploration.
* **Day 69+**. All data, including Kickstart, is removed. You can still log in to view saved dashboards and will be prompted to upgrade.

This change simplifies the trial experience, encourages timely upgrades, and helps reduce inactive accounts while preserving access to a product tour via Kickstart Data.

### Who’s affected?

Only [Flex](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/sumo-logic-flex-accounts) trial accounts created after \[DATE]. Other trial types like AWS Marketplace or credits-based are not impacted.

### Want to keep exploring?

Upgrading unlocks full access to features, longer retention, new capabilities, and technical support.
