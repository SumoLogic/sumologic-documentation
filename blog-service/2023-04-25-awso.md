We're excited to announce the release of AWS Observability 2.6. Here are some of the features the new version offers:
- Support for Amazon SQS - we've added out-of-the-box dashboards with important information about queue and message statistics, including 4 new dashboards and predefined monitors.
- Updates to AWS Lambda dashboards to include Lambda Telemetry API metrics.
- New Entity Inspector KPIs.
- Added evaluation delay to the out-of-the-box monitors to improve the accuracy and deviation detection.
- The Node.js runtime environment for the AWS Observability Lambda functions has been updated to the latest available versions.
