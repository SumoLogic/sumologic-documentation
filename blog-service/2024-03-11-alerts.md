We're happy to announce two new monitoring features that allow you to generate alerts that notify you of suspicious behavior and automatically run playbooks to address it.

### Anomaly detection

You can now use the *Anomaly detection method* when you create a monitor. This method applies machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and identify suspicious patterns. It establishes baselines for normal behavior so you receive alerts when deviations or unusual activities are encountered. 

[Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor).

### Automated playbooks

 An *automated playbook* is a predefined set of actions and conditional statements that run in an automated workflow to respond to an event. For example, suppose that a monitor detects suspicious behavior that could indicate a security problem. When the monitor sends the alert, it could also run an automated playbook to respond to the event.
