<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/service/archive/10-17-17.gif')} alt="releasenotes" />

---
## October 13, 2017

**Windows Event Log Source Host Change.** All Windows Event Logs contain a built-in "Computer" field, which is captured by the Computer = "..."; text you see in the Sumo messages.

**Problem.** We discovered an issue that caused sourceHost to be assigned incorrectly to a value that didn’t match the Computer field for the event.

**Resolution.** We have fixed this issue and now assign the Computer = "..."; field as _sourceHost.

**Impact: Minimal.** If you have queries and scheduled searches for Windows Event Logs that depend on _sourceHost values, you need to verify the change has no impact.

---
## October 10, 2017

**AND, OR, and NOT supported in Metrics Queries.** Logical operators are now supported in the metrics query language to let you specify complex Boolean expressions for metrics. For example, you can now say nodes not “forge” by stating: `!node=forge` and you can specify two specific clusters with OR.  For more information, see [Creating a Metrics Query and Visualization](/docs/metrics/metric-charts/create-metrics-visualization).

1. Choose your metric for CPU usage by application and the source hosts you want to track: <br/>
`metric=CPU_user _sourceHost=my_host`
2. Take an average of that metric. <br/>
`metric=CPU_user _sourceHost=my_host | avg`
3. See differences between your metric and your average. <br/>
`(#A - #B)/#B` <br/><img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/service/archive/9-14-17.png')} alt="releasenotes" />
4. Create an alert to let you know when that those differences reach a particular range.

**eval metrics operator.** The eval operator evaluates a time series based on a user-specified math expression. For more information, see [Metrics Operators](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators).

**Numeric literals and supported multiplier suffixes.** A number, or numeric literal, in the Sumo Query language is a set of digits containing no spaces, with an optional decimal point.  Numeric literals can end with a "multiplier suffix," which is a shorthand way to express scalar numeric values multiplied by common factors. For more information on supported multiplier suffixes for numeric literals, see [Field Expressions](/docs/search/search-query-language/field-expressions).

---
## July 17, 2017

**Custom labels for metrics time series**. The default label for time series is a comma-separated list of the dimensions included in the query. The resulting labels can be lengthy and inconvenient to scan. To shorten the labels and make them more meaningful in your metrics visualizations and in dashboards, you can [apply a naming convention for custom time series labels on a per-query basis](/docs/metrics/metric-charts). The labels can include text and also parameters that are enclosed in double curly braces.

---

## June 21, 2017

**Non-aggregate query speedup.** The histogram rendering time is reduced, charting your messages faster.

**Removal of 100k pause.** Non-aggregate queries are no longer limited to 100k messages at a time.

Be aware of the following changes that come with these enhancements:

* **Field counts still cap at 100k messages.** When the message count reaches more than 100k, you will see a message: “We only use the first 100,000 messages to calculate the field counts.”
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/service/archive/6-21-17.png')} alt="releasenotes" />
* **Field counts may still be loading.**  Field counts load asynchronously, and may still be loading after the histogram renders.
* **Receipt time still has 100k pause.** If your search uses receipt time, you will still see the 100k message limit.
* **Oldest message sorts first when you reach 100k messages.** Although you can have more than 100k messages in the histogram, the oldest message that will be shown is the 100k message. To get around this issue and see the range you want on the histogram, you can:
    ** Reduce the timerange and return the search.
    ** Shift+click on the histogram bar to drilldown into a specific timerange.

**New UI**. This release introduces a new look and feel and experience for the Sumo Logic UI. Navigation is simplified, and it’s now much easier to find the content you’re looking for.

If you're a current Sumo Logic user, you'll find that the navigation and some menu items have changed, but most of your working experience will be just as it was before. During the rollout period, we encourage you to start right away with the new UI. That way you'll get used to the changes and can start realizing the benefits.  New UI highlights include:

* **Improved navigation**. The menus that used to be on the top of of the UI are now on the left side (we call it the 'left nav'). The menus have been reorganized and some menu and page names have changed. See [Navigate Around the New Sumo Logic UI](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui) to learn how the navigation compares for the new UI and classic UI.
* **Switch between your tasks in Sumo Logic with the tab bar**. The top tab bar allows you to keep multiple pages open at the same time and easily navigate between them. The tabs persist across login sessions, and you can switch context without jumping to new browser tabs or windows. This includes having multiple dashboards open in separate tabs. See [Welcome to the new Sumo Logic UI](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).
* **New log searches, metrics visualizations, and Live Tail sessions**. It's now more convenient start working with logs or metrics. If you click the + icon in the Tabs area, you'll see options to select search, metrics, or Live Tail. See [Welcome to the new Sumo Logic UI](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).
* **Library**. The Library contents are available from the left nav or the Library page. This is the first step in providing enhanced content sharing capabilities, which we’ll be continuing to roll out in upcoming releases. See [Welcome to the New Library](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).
* **App Catalog**. You can access the App Catalog directly from the left nav to search for and install apps. See the topics under [Data Types](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).
* **Home page**. The new Home page provides quick access to recently opened dashboards and searches.  See [Welcome to the new Sumo Logic UI](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).

**Keyboard shortcuts**. Keyboard shortcuts have changed for the new UI. See [Keyboard Shortcuts for the New UI](/docs/get-started/keyboard-shortcuts).

**Apps**. The App Catalog has a new preview option. If you’re not sure what dashboards you’ll get with an app, you can click the

**Preview Dashboards **link in the App Catalog to see a preview of the dashboards included with the app.

**New tutorials**. We’ve updated our Quick Start tutorials to better reflect the different getting started experiences for setting up Sumo Logic and using Sumo Logic.

**Data Volume App updated.** The Sumo Logic [App for Data Volume](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/data-volume) allows you to view at a glance your account's data usage volume by category, collector, source name, and hosts. The app uses predefined searches and a Dashboard that provide visibility into your environment for real-time analysis of overall usage.

The Overview dashboard has been updated to provide a more comprehensive view of your Logs and Metrics data use.

The following dashboards have also been added:

* **Data Volume - Logs** See your log ingest volume in greater detail, outlining ingest spikes, outliers, and quota.
* **Data Volume (Logs) by various metadata fields** - Drill down on source metadata, using the metadata you've created within Sumo to better define your log sources.
* **Data Volume - Metrics.** Review details of your data ingest to identify areas of high-volume ingest.

**New Accumulate Operator for Metrics**. The `accum` metrics operator provides a running total over time of certain metrics. Use this when you are measuring a rate, and you want to understand the total number of occurrences. See [accum](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators).

**Multi-Query Math/JOIN for Metrics**. Compare multiple different metrics in new ways to derive new insights.  For example, compare network output and CPU use.

**AWS Elastic Load Balancer - Classic.** The AWS Elastic Load Balancer App has been renamed and updated to provide [new panels and dashboards](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/elastic-load-balancing-classic) such as the Failed Dispatch Monitoring Dashboard to help you better investigate your AWS ELB usage.

**Time Bucketing/Metrics quantization**. When you’re visualizing metrics data, the time axis is fundamental to understanding your data.

* Multiple time series (lines on the chart) should line up in a way that makes it easy to understand and compare behavior (for example, at 10:25AM server1 had 95% CPU usage and server2 had 50% CPU usage).
* As you change the time scale, the granularity of the data points should change accordingly (for example, 1 second resolution for a metric over 30 days doesn’t make sense).

This capability is called quantization. The quantization interval aligns your time series data to common intervals on the time axis (for example every one minute) to optimize the visualization and performance. See [Work with Metrics Visualizations](/docs/metrics/metric-charts/quantization-interval-chart).
