New - We've rolled out the ability to customize your alert resolution notifications. So when setting up Sumo Logic webhook connections, you can now design and test both your alert and recovery JSON payloads.

This customizable alert recovery payload functionality is currently supported for Slack, Microsoft Teams, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, generic webhook, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, and ServiceNow. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).

:::note
We're doing a slow rollout for this feature. By Thursday, Jan 19, all customers will have access.
