We're thrilled to announce the availability of the Closed Beta version of our updated Sumo Logic User Interface (UI). This release brings several enhancements aimed at improving your overall experience:

* **Unified Navigation**. Seamlessly access all Observability features (e.g., Alerts, Log Search, APM, Metrics) alongside Security features (e.g., Cloud SIEM, Cloud SOAR) from a single, unified left-navigation menu.
* **Streamlined Administration**. Administrative functions, Data Configuration, Help, and User Preferences have been relocated to the top toolbar menu for simplified access.
* **Enhanced Browsing Experience**. Say goodbye to in-app tabs and hello to native browser tabs. Experience accelerated performance, enhanced usability, and a consistently smooth browsing experience akin to other web applications. You can now utilize browser tabs, session history, back button, favorites, and other native browser capabilities you're familiar with.
* **Stateful URLs**. URLs now reflect real-time changes. Any modifications you make within the UI are instantly reflected in the URL parameters, ensuring you can effortlessly share the most up-to-date content with your collaborators.

To explore these improvements, reach out to your Sumo Logic sales representative for access to the Closed Beta. We look forward to your feedback as we continue to refine our UI.
