Update - We've released a Closed Beta of our brand new and improved Sumo Logic user interface (UI). To request access, contact your Sumo Logic sales representative. Here are some of the ways weâ€™ve streamlined and simplified the overall experience:

* Access to all Observability features (like Alerts and and Security features (like Cloud SIEM and Cloud SOAR) in one unified left-navigation menu.
* Access to administrative features (Administration, Configuration, Help, and User Preferences) have been moved to the top toolbar menu.
* In-app tabs have been replaced with native browser tabs, meaning faster performance, better usability, and consistent browsing experience similar to other web applications. You can now utilize browser tabs, session history, the back button, favorites, and other native browser capabilities you're familiar with.
* URLs are now stateful, making it easier for you to share the most up-to-date content with your teammates. Any changes you make in your UI will be reflected globally in the URL parameters.
