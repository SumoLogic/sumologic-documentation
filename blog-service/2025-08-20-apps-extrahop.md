We're excited to introduce the new ExtraHop RevealX 360 app for Sumo Logic, which enables you to gain real-time visibility into your security hub findings data. This app can help security teams to monitor detection trends, track changes in risk levels, and gain insights into the most frequently observed MITRE techniques, top destination devices, and key targets on the network.
