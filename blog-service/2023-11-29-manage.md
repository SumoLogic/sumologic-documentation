We're happy to announce that you can download the metadata XML of your SAML configurations. The service provider metadata XML allows you to easily share the Sumo Logic configuration information with your identity provider administrators, assisting them with the SAML setup process.

From the SAML configuration details screen, click the **Download Metadata XML** button to download the metadata XML for that configuration. You can also use the getSamlMetadata API to export the metadata XML.

For more information, see our documentation on how to [download metadata XML](/docs/manage/security/saml/set-up-saml/#download-metadata-xml).
