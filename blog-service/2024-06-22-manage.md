In November 2020, Sumo Logic announced the release of a product enhancement to our Ingest Budget feature (v2) that allowed greater flexibility and granularity in the metadata and fields, which is defined as part of an Ingest Budget Definition. Since then, when it was not possible to create a new Ingest Budget in v2, existing v1 budgets continued to operate in the way that they were defined.

**On September 9. 2024**, Sumo Logic will deprecate and remove the existing v1 Ingest Budgets that remain defined in customer Instances. 

Prior to September 9, 2024, review your current Ingest Budgets located in **Manage Data > Collection > Ingest Budgets** and any budgets tagged as v1. If these budgets are still needed and valid, you can [edit them and provide a scope to upgrade them to v2](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/ingest-budgets/daily-volume/#versions).

:::note
After the deprecation date, these legacy Ingest Budgets will be automatically removed, and if not migrated you can no longer limit ingestion.
