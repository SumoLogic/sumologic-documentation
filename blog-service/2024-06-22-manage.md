In November 2020, we introduced Ingest Budgets V2, offering greater flexibility and granularity in metadata and fields within the Ingest Budget Definition. Despite this update, existing V1 budgets continued to function as originally defined when creating new V2 budgets was not possible.

**On September 9. 2024**, Sumo Logic will deprecate and remove the existing v1 Ingest Budgets that remain defined in customer Instances. 

Prior to September 9, 2024, review your current Ingest Budgets located in **Manage Data > Collection > Ingest Budgets** and any budgets tagged as v1. If these budgets are still needed and valid, you can [edit them and provide a scope to upgrade them to v2](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/ingest-budgets/daily-volume/#versions).

:::note
After the deprecation date, these legacy Ingest Budgets will be automatically removed, and if not migrated you can no longer limit ingestion.
