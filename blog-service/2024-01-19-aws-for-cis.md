Weâ€™re excited to announce the general availability of Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS. This solution unifies views of active threats, security control failures, and suspicious activity across your AWS environment to give you security posture visibility at a glance.  

This feature was [previously only available in a preview form](/release-notes-service/2023/12/31/#november-27-2023-apps). It is now available for general use.

Here are some of the key features the new solution offers:
* **Risk overview**. See a summary of all resources that pose risks in a single dashboard that rolls up the findings from other dashboards. Get an action plan for addressing the most important areas of concern.
* **Active threats**. See active threats in APIs, resources, and storage.
* **Misconfigurations**. See areas in your environment that need to be addressed because they fail best practice security controls.
* **Suspicious activity assessment**. See suspicious activity across users, web interactions, networks, and Identity Access Management (IAM).
