We're excited to introduce the new Automox app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Automox source to collect audit and event logs from the Automox platform. It provides security and IT teams with visibility into endpoint management and security. By using this app, teams can improve their security monitoring, streamline endpoint management, and strengthen operational resilience. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/automox/).
