We're excited to introduce the new Digital Guardian ARC app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Digital Guardian source that provides data protection through analytics, reporting, and workflows. This integration helps to improve real-time activity monitoring, preconfigure alerts for different events, analyze policy enforcements, provide geolocation insights to support targeted threat investigation and response, and identify any potential tampering or unauthorized software by closely monitoring digital signatures for files and application.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/digital-guardian-arc/) to learn how to set up and use the Digital Guardian ARC app for Sumo Logic.
