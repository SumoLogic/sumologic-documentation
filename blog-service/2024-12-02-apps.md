We're excited to introduce the new Microsoft Defender for Cloud app for Sumo Logic. This app helps you to collect the alerts, security recommendation, and regulatory compliance logs using the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Azure Event Hub Source and by configuring the continuos export using the Event Hub instance details in the Azure portal. Key features of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud app include:

- Gain real-time visibility into security alerts across your Azure environment, categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low, and Informational).
- Monitor trends in alert activity over time to identify spikes and recurring threats.
- Leverage detailed alert summaries and remediation steps for effective threat mitigation.
- Track compliance performance across critical standards, including FedRAMP, PCI DSS 4, CIS Azure Foundations, and Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark.
- Analyze threats by categories like data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and account breaches.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/) to learn how to set up and use the Microsoft Defender for Cloud  app for Sumo Logic.
