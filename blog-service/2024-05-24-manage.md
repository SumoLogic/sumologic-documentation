We are excited to announce that we have added a new **Include this partition in default scope** checkbox to our Create Partitions page. This allows you to include or exclude the selected partition from the default scope of query. When included as the default scope, the partition will be considered for any search query by default. [Learn more](/docs/manage/partitions/flex/create-edit-partition-flex).
