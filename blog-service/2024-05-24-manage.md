We are excited to announce that we have added a new **Include this partition in default scope** checkbox to our Create Partitions page. This checkbox allows you to include or exclude the partition from the default query scope. When included, and if `_index` is not specified in the query, all the included partitions will be considered by default for search queries. [Learn more](/docs/manage/partitions/flex/create-edit-partition-flex).
