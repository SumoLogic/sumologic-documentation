We're excited to announce that we've introduced optimization improving the performance of Metrics queries that use aggregations (`avg`, `min`, `max`, `sum` or `count`) and which time range is within the last 24 hours.

Such queries are now faster, additionally allowing to aggregate data from a larger amount of time series.
