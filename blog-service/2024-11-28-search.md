Weâ€™re excited to announce the preview release of **Query Assist**, designed to simplify query building by reducing complexity, enabling easier field discovery, minimizing errors, and providing intelligent query-writing assistance. These enhancements deliver real-time syntax suggestions, schema-based recommendations, and a frictionless query experience.

### Key features

* **Real-time syntax suggestions**. Get instant recommendations for syntax and operators to accelerate query creation and reduce errors.  
* **Schema-based field suggestions**. Automatically discover relevant keys and fields for structured data like JSON logs.  
* **Partial query prediction**. Anticipate the next operator or receive partial query suggestions based on your input.  
* **Enhanced user experience**. Real-time error highlighting and intelligent suggestions provide a smooth and seamless query-building process.
