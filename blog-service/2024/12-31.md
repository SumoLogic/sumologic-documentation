#### Deprecation of Legacy Ingest Budgets V1 – Action Required by September 9, 2024

In November 2020, we introduced Ingest Budgets V2, offering greater flexibility and granularity in metadata and fields within the ingest budget definition. Despite this update, existing V1 budgets continued to function as originally defined while only allowing V2 budgets for all new configurations going forward.

V1 Ingest Budgets are deprecated, and **On September 9. 2024**, Sumo Logic will remove the existing V1 Ingest Budgets that remain defined in customer instances.

To ensure uninterrupted service, review your current ingest budgets under [**Ingest Budgets**](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/ingest-budgets/daily-volume#manage-ingest-budgets). Identify any budgets tagged as V1 and, if still needed, [edit and upgrade them to V2](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/ingest-budgets/daily-volume) before the deprecation date.

:::note
After September 9, 2024, any legacy ingest budgets that are not migrated will be automatically removed, resulting in the loss of ingestion limitation functionality.

#### Improved Data Handling for Window and Threshold-Based SLOs

We are happy to introduce a new update for handling missing data in window and threshold-based Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Previously, any window without data was treated as successful, and the threshold condition check was skipped. With this update, for windows without data, the threshold will be compared against **zero** to determine their success or failure.

This change simplifies expressing SLOs where missing data signifies unsuccessful windows. For example, consider an SLO definition where absence of heartbeat log messages signifies an unsuccessful window. Previously, such windows were treated as successful by default. With this update, modeling such cases will become much easier and more accurate.

### May 02, 2024 (Metrics)

#### Classic Metrics Deprecation and Removal

In January 2024, we deprecated Classic Metrics in favor of our newer Metrics Explorer interface. Effective today, Sumo Logic has removed the ability to use Classic Metrics in Sumo Logic.
* The **Switch to Classic UI** option is removed from the user interface and you can no longer switch to Classic Metrics.
* Any saved Classic Metrics queries are disabled and must be recreated with Metric Explorer.

Metrics Explorer represents an advanced solution tailored to meet all metric-related requirements. It surpasses Classic Metrics in functionality, making it redundant to continue supporting both systems.

For information, see [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer/).

### April 30, 2024 (Alerts)

#### Deprecation Notice - Real-Time Scheduled Searches

As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Sumo Logic service, we have decided to deprecate [Real-Time Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/create-real-time-alert). In particular, we will remove the option to create new Real-Time Scheduled Searches on May 15, 2024. Existing Real-Time Scheduled Searches will continue to function until May 15, 2025. We believe many use cases for Real-Time Scheduled Searches can be met by [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/overview). Any remaining use cases can be met by executing these searches at 15m intervals.

In 2020, Sumo Logic released Monitors, which provided a new framework to trigger alerts on both metrics and log data in real time and send notifications. Real-Time Scheduled Searches provided a much more limited version of this functionality. Monitors will continue to be the focus area for our Product and Engineering Teams for features and enhancements regarding alerting. Learn more [here](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/deprecation).

### April 26, 2024 (Apps)

[Learn more](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/azure-monitoring/ms-azure-event-hubs-source/).

### March 29, 2024 (Search)

#### Index Aliasing for Search Queries

We're excited to introduce the ability to reference Sumo Logic system indexes with an alias. With this update, you can now use an alias to point to one or more system indexes in the source expression of your search queries.

##### How it works

With index aliasing, you can use an alias to point to one or more system indexes, such as [`sumologic_default`](/docs/manage/partitions/run-search-against-partition/#search-the-default-partition) in the source expression of your query. Both the operator part and results of your query will consist of actual index names.

In addition to `sumologic_default`, we have several other Sumo Logic-defined system indexes. As a shortcut, rather than prefacing `sumologic_` when referencing system indexes in a search, you can alias these indexes by typing an underscore at the beginning. For example, `sumologic_default` and `_default` will return the same results. 

Learn more [here](/docs/manage/partitions/run-search-against-partition#index-aliasing).

NOTE: This feature is currently live in all deployments except `us2` and `prod`. It will be rolled out to those deployments by April 2, 2024.

### March 28, 2024 (Dashboards)

#### Dashboard Enhancements - Crosshair and Time Syncing

We are excited to announce a new set of changes to enhance the readability within the dashboard panels. With these updates, you'll have more control over time ranges, making it easier to investigate specific periods of interest and analyze data effectively. Here's what's included in this update:

- **Crosshair**. When you hover over a time series panel, Sumo Logic now displays a crosshair line with the time series data. If other time series panels are also configured with an overlapping time range, then when you hover over one time panel, a crosshair will be displayed on the other panels as well. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/panels/).

- **Time Syncing**. Using panel zoom feature you can now modify the time range of the dashboard to zoom in for granular details. This time range is considered as a temporary time range and all the other panels in the dashboard will be zoomed in for the selected time range. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/set-custom-time-ranges).

### March 27, 2024 (Search)

#### Estimate Scan Data - Flex

We're excited to include the **Estimate scan** details for a query with pay-per-search data, which allows you to get insights into the amount of data scanned to run the query.

### March 12, 2024 (Alerts)

#### Monitor Enhancements - AI-Driven Alerting

We're happy to announce two new monitoring features that allow you to generate alerts that notify you of suspicious behavior and automatically run playbooks to address it.

##### Anomaly detection

You can now use the *Anomaly detection method* when you create a monitor. This method applies machine learning techniques to detect anomalies and identify suspicious patterns. It establishes baselines for normal behavior so you receive alerts when deviations or unusual activities are encountered.[Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor).

##### Automated playbooks

An *automated playbook* is a predefined set of actions and conditional statements that run in an automated workflow to respond to an event. For example, suppose that a monitor detects suspicious behavior that could indicate a security problem. When the monitor sends the alert, it could also run an automated playbook to respond to the event. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/use-playbooks-with-monitors/).

#### Active Directory App Update

We're excited to announce an update for the [Active Directory JSON - OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/opentelemetry/active-directory-json-opentelemetry) application to enhance efficiency and data collection. We are updating the `sumo.datasource` value from Active Directory to Windows. This change addresses the double data ingestion issue that occurs for customers who have installed both Active Directory and Windows apps and set up separate OpenTelemetry collections for each.

:::note
  Data collected before the upgrade will not be visible in the Active Directory application.
:::

If you have only the **[Active Directory JSON - OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/opentelemetry/active-directory-json-opentelemetry)** app installed and decided to upgrade it, you will need to update your collection configuration according to the instructions below.

  1. Open the configuration file located in `C:\ProgramData\Sumo Logic\OpenTelemetry Collector\config\conf.d`.
  1. Update the following attributes:
      - key: `sumo.datasource`
      - value: `windows`
      - action: `insert`
  1. Restart the collector by using the following PowerShell command `Restart-Service -Name OtelcolSumo`.

If you have both the **[Windows - OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/opentelemetry/windows-opentelemetry)** and **[Active Directory JSON - OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/opentelemetry/active-directory-json-opentelemetry)** apps installed, you should remove the Active Directory OTEL YAML configuration from your machine to prevent double data ingestion. When upgrading the Active Directory app, there's no need to set up a new collection.

No changes are required if you only have **[Windows - OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/hosts-operating-systems/opentelemetry/windows-opentelemetry)** installed.
