In January 2024, we deprecated Classic Metrics in favor of our newer Metrics Explorer interface. Effective today, Sumo Logic has removed the ability to use Classic Metrics in Sumo Logic.
* The **Switch to Classic UI** option is removed from the user interface and you can no longer switch to Classic Metrics.
* Any saved Classic Metrics queries are disabled and must be recreated with Metric Explorer.

Metrics Explorer represents an advanced solution tailored to meet all metric-related requirements. It surpasses Classic Metrics in functionality, making it redundant to continue supporting both systems.

For information, see [Metrics Explorer](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer/).
