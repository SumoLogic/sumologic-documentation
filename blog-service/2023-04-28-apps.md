We're excited to announce the release of the new Asana app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic's [Cloud-to-Cloud Asana source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/asana-source) to provide real-time monitoring and security insight for your Asana account. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

* **Customizable searches**. Build custom searches to examine particular Asana data elements, allowing you to go deeper into the data and find insights that are pertinent to your company's needs.
* **Integration with other sources**. Use in conjunction with other Sumo Logic Apps, which enables you to gain a more holistic view of the data.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/asana) to learn how you can set up and use the Asana App for Sumo Logic.
