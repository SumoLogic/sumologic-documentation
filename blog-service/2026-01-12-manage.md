We’re excited to announce that signing in to Sumo Logic is now even more convenient using your Google account credentials. If your email address is associated with a Google account, simply select **Continue with Google** on the sign-in page to access Sumo Logic with no additional setup required.

You can also use Google SSO when signing up for a new Sumo Logic account. Organizations that use SAML or other identity providers can continue to sign in using their existing authentication methods. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/sign-up/).
