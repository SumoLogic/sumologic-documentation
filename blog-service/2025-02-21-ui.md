We’re excited to announce the next milestone in our transition to the New UI. Starting today, the New UI will become the default experience when you sign in to Sumo Logic.

The Classic UI will be retired in 2025. The exact date will be communicated closer to the transition. To ensure you have access to the latest features, performance improvements, and innovations, we encourage you to start using the New UI as soon as possible.

## What’s changing?

* **New UI by default**. You will automatically log into the New UI when signing in.  
* **Temporary opt-out**. If your org was created before this change, you can switch back to the Classic UI, and future logins will remember your preference.  
* **New orgs use only the new UI**. If your org was created after this change, the Classic UI will not be available.  
* **MSSP exception**. If your org was created through a parent org, you can still switch to the Classic UI.

## Improvements since initial release

Here's what's changed since the [last rollout](/release-notes-service/2024/12/31/#september-19-2024-user-interface).

* **Faster navigation and performance**. Improved menu loading, collapsible and resizable subnavigation, and persistent menu state across tabs.  
* **More intuitive workflows**. Open/duplicate log searches, drill into Favorites folders, and set a preference to open menu items in new tabs.  
* **New features and enhancements**. Improved keyboard navigation and UI refinements.  
* **Bug fixes**. Improved org switcher, Library search fixes, and other minor UI updates.
