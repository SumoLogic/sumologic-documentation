#### Metrics

We're delighted to announce the availability of these new operators:

* [stddev](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/stddev)—Calculates the standard deviation of the metrics values that match the query.
* [in](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/in)—You can use this operator in a metrics query selector as shorthand for multiple OR conditions.
