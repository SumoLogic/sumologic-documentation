Update - The default [web session timeout](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/set-max-web-session-timeout) for new users has been increased from 15 minutes to 6 hours. If your currently configured session timeout is set to less than 6 hours, new users will receive the value set within the policy as the default.  

Update - We Increased the timeout for new user account verification from 12 hours to 72 hours to allow for weekends and to give new users more time to see and take action on the new user welcome email.
