## December 9, 2019 (Security)

Update - We've improved the authentication process for Sumo users that have multiple accounts. Now, you can seamlessly switch between accounts, either on the same deployment or different deployments, without re-authenticating. For more information, see [Multi-Account Access](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/multi-account-access).

## December 9, 2019 (Collection)

New - [Amazon MSK Prometheus metrics collection](/docs/send-data/collect-from-other-data-sources/amazon-msk-prometheus-metrics-collection) page provides instructions for configuring metrics collection for Amazon MSK. As part of Amazon MSK's Open Monitoring, Kafka metrics are exposed to third-party sources for monitoring and troubleshooting MSK clusters.

Beta- [Archive](/docs/manage/archive) lets you forward log data from [Installed Collectors](/docs/send-data/installed-collectors) to AWS S3 buckets to collect at a later time. If you have logs that you don't need to search immediately, you can archive them for later and ingest them on-demand with hourly granularity. To get started, contact your Sumo account executive or sign up for an [enterprise trial account](https://www.sumologic.com/sign-up/).

The key new components provided are:

- **AWS Archive bucket **a Data Forwarding destination that lets you set up your AWS S3 buckets as archive destinations.

- **Archive messages that match **aProcessing Rule that lets you archive log data with Installed Collector Sources.

- **AWS S3 Archive **aHosted Collector Source allows you to ingest data from an archive destination.

- **AWS S3 Archive **Source to ingest a specific time range of data from your Archive at any time.

New - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. CORS support allows you to restrict Sumo API calls, or to securely allow remote Web to applications to access Sumo Logic, based on request origin. To leverage CORS support, you associate a whitelist of domains with a Sumo access key. For more information, see [Access Keys](/docs/manage/security/access-keys).
