We're excited to announce out-of-the-box log level distribution for ad-hoc Log Search queries. Helps to quickly identify anomalies, drill down in the high severity logs quickly, navigate through a large volume of logs, and filter the relevant logs in your troubleshooting workflows.

With this update, you can visualize and filter log-level distribution in the Histogram results and Messages table messages of specific log level(s) in the same view. [Learn more](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/search-page/histogram).
