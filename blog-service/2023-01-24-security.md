Update - We have updated the **Reuse Password After** password policy. Previously, you could prevent Sumo Logic users from reusing up to 10 previously used passwords. Now, you can prevent users from reusing up to 12 previously used passwords. For more information, see [Set the Password Policy](/docs/manage/security/set-password-policy/).
