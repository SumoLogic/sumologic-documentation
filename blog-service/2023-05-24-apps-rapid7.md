We're releasing a new app called Rapid7 app that leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Rapid7 source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/rapid7-source/). It enables you to obtain a deeper understanding of asset and vulnerability management activities, prioritize remediation efforts, reduce attack surfaces, and make informed decisions to improve your overall security posture.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/rapid7) to learn how you can set up and use the Rapid7 app for Sumo Logic.
