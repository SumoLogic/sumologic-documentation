We're thrilled to announce the availability of the Closed Beta version of our updated Sumo Logic User Interface (UI). This release brings several enhancements aimed at improving your overall experience:

* **Unified Navigation**. Seamlessly access all Observability features (e.g., Alerts, Log Search, APM, Metrics) alongside Security features (e.g., Cloud SIEM, Cloud SOAR) from a single, unified left-navigation menu. This is a massive improvement over our legacy Classic UI, where you needed to leave Sumo Logic when using Cloud SIEM or SOAR.
* **Streamlined Administration**. Administrative functions, Data Configuration, Help, and User Preferences have been relocated to the top toolbar menu for simplified access.
* **Enhanced Browsing Experience**. Say goodbye to in-app tabs and hello to native browser tabs. You can now utilize browser tabs, session history, back button, favorites, and other native browser capabilities you're familiar with.
* **Improved Performance**. With a simplified UI, you'll experience accelerated performance, enhanced usability, and a consistently smooth browsing experience, allowing you to troubleshoot incidents faster. We've achieved significant improvements in two primary metrics:
   * **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**. ~90% improvement (synthetic), 75% improvement (RUM).
   * **Time to Interactivity (TTI)**. ~27% improvement (synthetic), 50% improvement (RUM).
* **Stateful URLs**. URLs now reflect real-time changes. Any modifications you make within the UI are instantly reflected in the URL parameters, ensuring you can effortlessly share the most up-to-date content with your collaborators.
