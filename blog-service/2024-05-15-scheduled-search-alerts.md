As part of our ongoing evaluation of the Sumo Logic service, we have decided to deprecate [Real-Time Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/create-real-time-alert). In particular, we will remove the option to create new Real-Time Scheduled Searches on May 15, 2024. Existing Real-Time Scheduled Searches will continue to function until May 15, 2025. We believe many use cases for Real-Time Scheduled Searches can be met by [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/overview). Any remaining use cases can be met by executing these searches at 15m intervals.

In 2020, Sumo Logic released Monitors, which provided a new framework to trigger alerts on both metrics and log data in real time and send notifications. Real-Time Scheduled Searches provided a much more limited version of this functionality. Monitors will continue to be the focus area for our Product and Engineering Teams for features and enhancements regarding alerting.
