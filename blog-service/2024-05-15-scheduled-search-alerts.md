Effective **May 15, 2024**, Real-Time Scheduled Searches have been deprecated and you can no longer create them. Real-Time Scheduled Searches created before that date will continue to function until **May 15, 2025**.

We encourage you instead to [create a monitor](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor) and set it to execute near-real-time searches (lowest available duration is 15m intervals).

Learn more [here](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/deprecation).
