Updated - Weâ€™re pleased to announce the availability of permissions for Monitors folders. This feature enables folder-level control of who can view, update, create, delete, and manage Monitors. For more information, see [Grant permissions to Monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors#Grant_permissions_to_Monitors_folders) folders.

This feature is not enabled by default. Contact Sumo Logic Support to have it enabled.
