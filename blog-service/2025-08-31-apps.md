### New release

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of the new Azure Event Hubs app and OpenTelemetry Collector Insights app for Sumo Logic.

- **Azure Event Hubs**. The Azure Event Hubs app helps monitor data plane operations, such as sending or receiving events, and tracks performance metrics, including consumer lag, throughput, and active connections. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-event-hubs/).
- **OpenTelemetry Collector Insights**. The OpenTelemetry Collector Insights app provides end-to-end monitoring for your OpenTelemetry Collector instances, enabling you to track performance, data flow, and resource utilization. Use preconfigured dashboards and alerts to troubleshoot issues and ensure your telemetry pipeline runs smoothly and efficiently. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/sumo-apps/opentelemetry-collector-insights/).

### Enhancements

- **Azure Virtual Machine**. Automated Metric Rule creation during app install. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-virtual-machine/#installing-the-azure-virtual-machine-app).
