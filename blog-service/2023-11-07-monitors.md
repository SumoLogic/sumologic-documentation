We've rolled out the ability to designate a **Preferred Time Zone** when you're setting up alert monitor notifications. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/monitors/create-monitor#step-3-notifications-optional).

**NOTE**: Currently, we support time zone specifications within an email action object. This is being deprecated for *API and Terraform users only* and will not be supported effective February 2024.
