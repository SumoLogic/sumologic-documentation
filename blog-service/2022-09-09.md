#### Apps

New - LambdaTest allows you to analyze your testing behavior and error trends. LambdaTest is a continuous quality testing cloud platform that helps developers and testers ship code faster. The [LambdaTest](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-public-partner-apps/tree/master/LambdaTest) platform provides secure, scalable, and insightful test orchestration for customers at different points in their DevOps (CI/CD) lifecycle.

New - weâ€™re happy to announce the release of the [Sumo Logic App for AWS Cost Explorer](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/cost-explorer), which allows you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

With the Sumo Logic App for AWS Cost Explorer, you can use our out-of-the-box dashboards as well as filtering and grouping capabilities to dive deeper into your cost and usage data and generate custom insights. Gain a better understanding of your cost trends and see detailed information about the costs and usage associated with your top cost-accruing AWS accounts, regions, services, and operations.

Update - We are happy to announce the release of a new Explore Hierarchy for Database [Application Components](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/observability/application-components), together with the support of related Database Entities in Entity Inspector. This functionality allows you to organize your data in a structured hierarchy and utilize the database dashboards available out-of-the-box from App Catalog. Currently, the following Database engines are supported by this feature:

* [Cassandra](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/databases/cassandra)
