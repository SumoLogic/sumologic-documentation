Update - Traces can now show aggregated trace duration [critical path contribution (CPC) breakdown chart](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces#trace-duration-breakdown-chart) summarized for all traces from the Traces query result set.

Use this chart to:

* Quickly understand intermittent duration spikes or slowdowns
* Immediately spot offending service by comparing CPC contribution by service
