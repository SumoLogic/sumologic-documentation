We are excited to introduce the **Multiple Scheduled Reports** feature to Sumo Logic dashboards. This powerful new capability allows you to configure multiple reports against a dashboard, providing enhanced flexibility and control over your reporting needs. Key features include:

- **Multiple Configurations**. Set up several reports from the same dashboard, each with its unique settings.
- **Custom Variable Values**. Assign different variable values to each report, tailoring the data to meet specific reporting needs.
- **Custom Time Ranges**. Define distinct time ranges for each report, ensuring you capture the data most relevant to your analysis.
- **Run Frequencies**. Schedule reports to run at varying frequencies, from daily snapshots to monthly summaries.
- **Email Addresses**. Specify one or more email addresses for each report, ensuring the right information reaches the right stakeholders.
