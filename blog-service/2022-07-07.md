Update - Weâ€™ve improved our zoom-in feature for metric charts. Up until now, zooming into a metric chart simply increased the size of the chart. Now, for time series charts in which the query uses automatic quantization, when you zoom in the chart presents results based on more granular data: the bucket size across which results are quantized is reduced. For more information, see [Zoom in on a time series chart](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/metric-charts/interacting-metric-charts#Zoom-in-on-a-time-series-chart).
