We're happy to announce the partial migration of 134 [Classic Apps (Legacy)](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/#classic-apps-legacy) to [Next-Gen Apps](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/#next-gen-apps), out of an expected total of approximately 300.

Next-Gen Apps streamline app management and maintenance by supporting versioning and upgrades. These apps can be installed through the App Catalog UI and the [Sumo Logic Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SumoLogic/sumologic/latest/docs/resources/app). To explore all available Next-Gen Apps, select the Next-Gen Apps filter on the **App Catalog** page.
