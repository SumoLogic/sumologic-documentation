We're happy to announce the migration of 134 [Classic Apps (Legacy)](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/#classic-apps-legacy) to [Next-Gen Apps](/docs/get-started/apps-integrations/#next-gen-apps). Next-Gen apps simplify the management and maintenance of apps by supporting app versioning and upgrades. These Next-Gen apps can be installed via the App Catalog UI and [Sumo Logic terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SumoLogic/sumologic/latest/docs/resources/app). To view all the available Next-Gen apps select the **Next-Gen Apps** filter in the App Catalog page.
