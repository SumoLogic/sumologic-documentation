We're excited to annouce the new **AutoPause** feature for Scheduled Views, designed to enhance system performance and optimize resource usage.

With AutoPause, any Scheduled View that remains inactive for 90 consecutive days (i.e., not queried or referenced) will be automatically flagged and paused. To ensure you're informed ahead of time, Scheduled View owners and active account administrators will receive email and in-app notifications 21 days and 7 days before the scheduled pause. If no action is taken, the view will be automatically paused on the 90th day, followed by a final alert. [Learn more](/docs/manage/scheduled-views/pause-disable-scheduled-views/).
