We're excited to announce that you can use roles to restrict access to specific data in search indexes. When you create a role, you can select **Index based** filters to allow access to data based on indexes, or you can select **Advanced filter** to define a dataset to allow access based on search criteria. This ensures that users only see the data they are supposed to.
