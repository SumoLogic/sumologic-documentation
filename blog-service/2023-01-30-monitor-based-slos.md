New - Critical Monitors that alert you to customer-critical service interruptions and other reliability measurements are great candidates to convert to Service-Level Objectives (SLOs). We've made this easy: you can now create SLOs directly from your Monitors in just a couple of clicks. The thresholds you set in your Monitor will carry over automatically to your new SLO definition, saving you time and effort.
