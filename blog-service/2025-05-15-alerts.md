As of today, all remaining Real-Time Scheduled Searches have been automatically converted to 15-minute schedules. The ability to create or run Scheduled Searches with real-time frequency is no longer supported.

Key details:
* Real-Time frequency is no longer available in Scheduled Search creation or editing workflows.
* Any previously existing Real-Time Scheduled Searches now run on a 15-minute schedule.
* Each conversion has been recorded as an audit log event in your account.
* A small number of accounts with approved exceptions remain unaffected.

For real-time alerting, use [Monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors/overview), which provide richer capabilities such as multiple trigger conditions, alert grouping, and AI-driven insights. Learn more: [Deprecation of Real-Time Scheduled Searches](/docs/alerts/scheduled-searches/create-real-time-alert)
