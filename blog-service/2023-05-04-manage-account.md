We're excited to announce that we offer [audit logs for connections](https://service.us2.sumologic.com/audit/docs/#tag/Connections). Now whenever someone manages a [webhook connection](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections), you can check the audit event index to learn about the change. For more information, see [Audit Event Index](/docs/manage/security/audit-event-index/#audited-events).
