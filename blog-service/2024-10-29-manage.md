We are happy to introduce our new **Usage Management** tab under the **Accounts** section. This feature allows you to define query spending limits, helping prevent unexpected charges and manage Sumo Logic credits, particularly in pay-per-use scenarios by limiting search volume.

Key features include:

- **Org-wide query budget**. Set a budget for queries that applies to all users in the organization.
- **User level and role level query budget**. Set limits on query data volume at the user level and role level.
- **Flexible actions**. Choose what happens when the budget limit is reached. Options include **Display a warning to the user** or **Restrict queries to background scans only**.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/usage-management/) to learn how to set up and use Scan Budgets.
