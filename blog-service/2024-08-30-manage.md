We are happy to announce the availability of the closed beta version of a new feature for data forwarding. You can now configure the schema and format of log data forwarded from Sumo Logic to an S3 destination. Previously, forwarding was limited to raw log data along with its metadata and enriched fields. Now, you have the flexibility to choose between forwarding only log data, log data with metadata, or log data with metadata and enriched fields, in either CSV or JSON format. This enhanced flexibility enables you to perform more precise analytics on the data using your preferred tools.

To explore these improvements, reach out to your Sumo Logic sales representative for access to the Closed Beta. We look forward to your feedback as we continue to refine our UI.
