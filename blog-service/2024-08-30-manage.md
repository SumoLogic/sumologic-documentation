We are happy to announce that you can now configure the schema and format of log data forwarded from Sumo Logic to an S3 destination. Previously, forwarding was limited to raw log data along with its metadata and enriched fields. Now, you have the flexibility to choose between forwarding only log data, log data with metadata, or log data with metadata and enriched fields, in either CSV or JSON format.

This enhanced flexibility enables you to perform more precise analytics on the data using your preferred tools.

To learn more, see [Forward data to S3](/docs/manage/data-forwarding/amazon-s3-bucket/#forward-datato-s3) in our article [Forward Data from Sumo Logic to S3](/docs/manage/data-forwarding/amazon-s3-bucket).
