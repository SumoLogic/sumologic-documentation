We are happy to announce that you can now forward raw log data from Sumo Logic to an S3 destination. Previously, you could only forward raw log data together with its metadata and enriched fields. You can now choose to forward only log data, log data and metadata, or log data with metadata and enriched fields, in either CSV or JSON format.

The ability to choose the kind of data forwarded, as well as its format in either CSV or JSON, allows you to perform more precise analytics on the data in your tools of choice.

To learn more, see [Forward data to S3](/docs/manage/data-forwarding/amazon-s3-bucket/#forward-datato-s3) in our article [Forward Data from Sumo Logic to S3](/docs/manage/data-forwarding/amazon-s3-bucket).
