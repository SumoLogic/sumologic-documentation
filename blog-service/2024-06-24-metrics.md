We're excited to announce the release of Metrics Data Ingestion, a new screen that provides detailed information about your metrics data consumption.

Metrics Data Ingestion answers the question, “What things are sending metrics data, and how much are they sending?”. This screen not only provides high level information about the metrics volume, you'll also see a breakdown by individual metric, as well as specific dimensions and sources. With this information, you can determine the items that contribute most to your credit consumption.

To view the new screen, navigate to **Administration > Account > Metrics Data Ingestion**.
