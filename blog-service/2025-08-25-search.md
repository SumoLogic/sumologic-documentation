Copilot now supports multi-turn conversations, allowing you to ask follow-up questions without repeating your original search context. This enhancement enables more natural, iterative investigations. Copilot keeps track of your query history so you can refine searches, dig deeper into results, and troubleshoot faster.

This feature is in Beta. To participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or our Support Team. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot/).
