We're excited to announce the ability to run a log search queries directly within a selected child org under a parent org. Additionally, you can now fetch data from the selected child org and seamlessly view the associated dashboards, thereby enabling more granular monitoring and insights.

This enhancement streamlines workflows across multi-org environments and makes it easier to dive into org-specific insights while staying connected at the parent org level.
