Archive of February 2022 Service Release Notes.


---
## February 24, 2022 (Search)

New - The [Search Query Language](https://help.sumologic.com/search/search-query-language) has a new operator, [dedup](https://help.sumologic.com/search/search-query-language/search-operators/dedup) allows you to:

* Remove duplicate events containing an identical combination of values for the fields.
* Specify the number of duplicate events to keep for each value of a single field.
* Choose a combination of duplicate values among several fields.

## February 18, 2022 (Security)

Update - We’ve eased the process of offboarding Sumo Logic users. Now, when you delete a user’s Sumo Logic account, you can transfer the user’s [Monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors) to another user, along with folders, searches, scheduled searches, scheduled views, monitors, and dashboards. For more information, see [Delete a User](https://help.sumologic.com/manage/users-roles/users/delete-user).

## February 18, 2022 (Monitors)

Update - The [Monitors page](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors#Monitors_page) has a new shortcut to quickly view triggered alerts from a Monitor. Hover your cursor over the Status column of a Monitor and click the icon to open [Alert List](https://help.sumologic.com/alerts/monitors/Alert-Response#Alert-List).


---
## February 12, 2022 (Apps)

New - We are delighted to announce the release of the Sumo Logic [Couchbase](https://help.sumologic.com/integrations/databases/Couchbase) App. The Couchbase app is a unified logs and metrics app that helps you monitor the availability, performance, and resource utilization of Couchbase database clusters. The preconfigured dashboards provide insight into the health of clusters, the status of the buckets, I/O of reading/writing, errors, events of Couchbase servers that help you understand your clusters.

---
## February 11, 2022 (Manage)

Update - We’ve made an improvement to the [Sumo Logic Organizations](https://help.sumologic.com/manage/Manage-Subscription/Create-Manage-Orgs) (Sumo Orgs) feature, which allows you to create, provision, and manage multiple "child" orgs from a "parent" org. Now, when you provision a child org, you can allocate credits for [trace](https://help.sumologic.com/apm/traces) ingestion, as well as log and metric ingestion.

---
## February 10, 2022 (Traces)

New - Number of [spans](https://help.sumologic.com/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/spans) per Trace has been increased by 10 times to 10000 spans per trace to better support monitoring for long running and complex transactions. Please note that new spans can increase credits consumption.

Update - Traces logs and data includes a new `duration` field that holds the difference between `endTimestamp` and `startTimestamp` in nanoseconds.

---
## February 8, 2022 (Traces)

New - Announcing general availability of dashboard support for Trace Spans data index. You can now pin results of your queries on spans data directly to the Dashboard. You can add the query through the Log Search screen when running queries in `_trace_spans` index as long as your read volume does not exceed 200x of your tracing ingest ([more info](https://help.sumologic.com/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/search-query-language-support-for-traces)). Support for doing this directly from the Spans analytics window is coming soon.

---
## February 4, 2022 (Apps)

New - The Sumo Logic app for [Sauce Labs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/basics/integrations/sumo/) integrates your Sauce Labs test data with the Sumo Logic Analytics Platform to easily aggregate, visualize, and monitor all of your test data. Connect Sauce Labs data with other data sources for a comprehensive view of your development pipeline.
