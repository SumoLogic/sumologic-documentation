We're excited to share some updates to the new UI based on feedback we've received from our customers. These updates were implemented to enhance your navigation experience and improve your workflow.

- **Tree position memory**. The Library navigation now remembers where you left off within the tree structure, making it easier to return to your exact spot when re-opening the subnavigation.
- **Remembered menu state**. The expand/collapse state of the navigation menu is now persistent when opening new tabs, giving you a consistent experience across multiple browser tabs.
- **Pin subnavigation**. You can now “pin” a subnavigation menu to keep it open while working within a specific feature area, giving you quicker access to what you need.
- **Resizable submenu**. Widen the submenu to better view content items with longer names.

You can try the new UI by clicking the **Switch to New UI** link from the Classic UI menu navigation. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).
