We're excited to introduce the new Code42 Incydr app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud Code42 Incydr source that collects audits, file events, and user sessions data from the Code42 Incydr platform. This app helps security analysts monitor, detect, and respond to potential data threats across an organization. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/code42-incydr/).
