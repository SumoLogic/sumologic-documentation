We're excited to announce the release of the new Tenable app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Tenable source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/tenable-source/) to gain comprehensive visibility and actionable insights into your organization's security posture. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Vulnerability Assessment**. Perform in-depth vulnerability assessments across your infrastructure using the [Tenable Vulnerabilities API](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/exports-vulns-request-export).
- **Audit Event Monitoring**. Monitor and analyze critical audit events within your organization using the [Tenable Audit Events API](https://developer.tenable.com/reference/audit-log-events).

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/tenable/) to learn how you can set up and use the Tenable app for Sumo Logic.
