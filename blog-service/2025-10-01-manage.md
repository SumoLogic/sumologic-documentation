Sumo Logic has introduced a change to the way group-to-role mapping is handled when performing on-demand role provisioning during SAML authentication. Previously, all groups included in a SAML assertion were validated against roles in Sumo Logic. Going forward, only the groups that match existing roles in Sumo Logic will be applied to the authenticating user. Any non-matching groups will be ignored. Only if no roles match with the groups passed in the assertion will an authentication fail.

For more information about provisioning, see [SCIM Provisioning](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/security/scim/).
