You can now report CircleCI job analytics to your Sumo Logic dashboard using our new job-collector command, which sends environment, team, and service information at the job level. 

Add this command to your job with the environment, team, or service custom-data values as parameters. This command will run with the rest of the job's commands for sending the job log.

:::note
Not including this command at the job level will send empty custom-data values to Sumo.
