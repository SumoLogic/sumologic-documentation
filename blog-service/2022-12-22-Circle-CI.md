Now you can report CircleCI job analytics to your SumoLogic dashboard.

New job-collector command:
This command sends environment, team, and service information at the job level. Add this command to your job with the environment, team, or service custom-data values as parameters. This command will run with the rest of the job's commands for sending the job log.

:::
Note: Not including this command at the job level will send empty custom-data values to Sumo.

Also, the orb is now at sumologic/sumologic. The new orb repo is https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-orb
