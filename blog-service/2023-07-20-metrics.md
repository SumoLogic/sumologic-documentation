We are making some changes to Metrics ingest and storage. Metrics reported with a timestamp older than 24 hours ago or newer than 24 hours in the future from the time they are reported will be dropped. These changes are made to make our metrics backend system more performant, efficient, and reliable.

The update should not have any impact on your usage of Sumo Logic, unless you were specifically sending old metrics data to the platform. Check out more details [here](/docs/metrics/manage-metric-volume/metric-ingestion-and-storage).
