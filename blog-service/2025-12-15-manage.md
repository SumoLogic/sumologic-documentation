We're excited to announce the ability to manage monitors for enterprises with multiple organizations such as MSSPs (which typically have a parent organization with multiple child organizations). This lets you save, share, and manage monitors for tracking your metrics and logs data in real time and send notifications when noteworthy changes happen in your applications.
