We're excited to announce enhancements to Cloud Infrastructure for AWS. These capabilities were [previously only available in a preview form](/release-notes-service/2024/05/13/apps/). They are now available for general use.

### Streamlined installation

You can now more easily [configure sources](/docs/security/cloud-infrastructure-security/cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws/#install-cloud-infrastructure-security-for-aws) on a simplified screen allowing you to use existing sources or create new sources.

You can now use automated remediation playbooks in monitors built specifically for Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS.
