We're excited to announce enhancements to Cloud Infrastructure for AWS. These capabilities were [previously only available in a preview form](/release-notes-service/2024/05/13/apps/). They are now available for general use.

You now have increased visibility into your AWS Cloud environment with the following new features:

### Streamlined installation

You can now more easily configure sources on a simplified screen allowing you to use existing sources or create new sources. 

### Out-of-the-box security policy checks

Sumo Logic Cloud Infrastructure Security is now configured by default to use the out-of-the box policy checks. You can now choose to leverage the out-of-the-box policy checks instead of, or in conjunction with, the policy checks provided by AWS Security Hub. 

### AI-powered remediation plans

You can now use automated remediation playbooks in monitors built specifically for Cloud Infrastructure Security for AWS.
