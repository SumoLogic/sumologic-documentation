We're excited to announce the release of several new features in the **Dashboards (New)**:

- **Sankey Chart**. You can find our new **Sankey diagram** feature under the **Categorical** panel type, which is built using two fields in your query, such as `fromstate` and `tostate`. The Sankey diagram helps you to understand the flow of the log events within a distributed system, and the width of an arrow or stripe in the Sankey diagram shows the proportion of a quantity.

- **Missile Map**. You can find our new **Missile Map** feature under the **Map** panel type, which helps you to get visibility into the geographic origins of threats and their target points, by hovering over each line, you will be able to find the threat name, latitude and longitude details of threat origin, and latitude and longitude details of threat target point.
