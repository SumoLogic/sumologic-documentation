We're excited to announce the release of several new features in the **Dashboards (New)**:

- **Sankey Chart**. This feature enables you to visualize the flow for related sequences of logs within a distributed system using two fields in your query, such as `fromsate` and `tostate`.

- **Missile Map**. This feature provides visibility into threat sources and targets, allowing you to pinpoint the region of the world from which you are being attacked.
