We've rolled out the ability to customize your alert resolution notifications. So when setting up Sumo Logic webhook connections, you can now design and test both your alert and recovery JSON payloads.

Currently supported for Slack, Microsoft Teams, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, generic webhook, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, and ServiceNow. [Learn more](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections).
