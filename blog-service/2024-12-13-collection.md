We are excited to announce the release of our new Universal Connector. With this cloud source, you can collect log data from vendor APIs using a modular configuration. This source allows Sumo Logic to expand its configuration modules over time, providing greater compatibility with various vendor APIs. However, it's important to note that complex APIs will still require a specific cloud source and may not be compatible with this universal source.
