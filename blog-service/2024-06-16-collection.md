We're excited to announce the release of our new Azure Blob Storage collection. This new integration provides a event-based pipeline for shipping monitoring data from Azure Blob Storage to an HTTP source on Sumo Logic. This solution can be used to monitor Azure services that do not support exporting logs to Azure Monitor.
