We've released two metrics updates.

Update - **Expanded support for thresholds in metrics charts**. We've expanded support for setting Warning and Critical threshold values for metrics query results in charts.  Now, you can define threshold metrics values in the **Chart** view for Time Series panels, and for these chart types for Categorical panels: Line, Area, Bar, Column, and Table. For more information, see [Set Warning and Critical Thresholds](/docs/metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer/#set-warning-and-critical-thresholds).

Update - **Unified `where` and `filter` metrics operators**. We have merged the functionality of the `filter` metrics operator into the `where` operator. Previously you could use the `filter` operator to filter out time series, and the `where` operator to filter out data points within a time series. Now, the updated `where` operator supports filtering by time series and by data point. For more information, see [where Metrics Operator](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/where/).

:::note
The [filter](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators/filter/) operator is still supported, but will be deprecated in the future.
