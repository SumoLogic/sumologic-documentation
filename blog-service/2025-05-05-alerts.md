The [previously announced](/release-notes-service/2024/12/31/#deprecation-notice---real-time-scheduled-searches) automatic conversion of Real-Time Scheduled Searches to 15-minute scheduled searches will not take place.

- Existing Real-Time Scheduled Searches will continue to operate as-is.
- Creating new Real-Time Scheduled Searches remains disabled (since May 29, 2024).
- For new real-time alerting use cases, we recommend using [Monitors](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/alerts/monitors/overview).
