We've enhanced the Trace Query Visualizations screen by adding five new aggregation charts alongside the existing Trace duration breakdown chart. These charts provide more insights into the behavior and performance of your application. Aggregating traces allows you to quickly identify anomalies and unexpected behaviors, resulting in a shorter Time-to-Resolution (TTR) and a higher Return on Investment (ROI).
The new aggregate charts are available as time-series or histogram and cover following 3 metrics:
* Trace duration
* Error count
* Span count
The new aggregate charts are available as time-series or histogram and cover following 3 metrics:

The new aggregate charts are:
* Trace duration
* Error count
* Span count
* Trace duration as timeseries
* Trace duration as histogram

To access the new charts, simply navigate to the Trace Query Visualizations screen and select the **Trace duration** dropdown menu. From there, you can choose from the **duration/errors/spans** (per trace) and **timeseries/histogram** options. With these choices, you'll now have a total of six charts to help you better understand the profile of your traces.

NOTE: We recommend filtering your trace data to represent transactions for the best results.
