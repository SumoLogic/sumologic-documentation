We're excited to introduce the new VMware Workspace ONE app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud VMware Workspace ONE source that collects audit logs data from the VMware Workspace ONE platform. This app helps security analysts monitor device compliance, encryption, and overall security status, offering a powerful solution for effective risk analysis, policy enforcement, and device security.
