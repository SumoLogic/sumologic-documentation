On November 10, we released improvements to the **Account Overview** page. Now, an admin for a parent org can see  detailed usage of Sumo Credits for different product variables, aggregated across child orgs from the start of the contract period. Another nice enhancement: the **Account Overview** page now also presents Promotional Credits consumption. For more information, see [Create and Manage Orgs](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/manage-subscription/create-manage-orgs/#monitor-credits-quota-and-usage).
