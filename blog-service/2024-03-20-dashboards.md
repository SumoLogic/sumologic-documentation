We are excited to announce a new set of changes to enhance the readability within the dashboard panels. With these updates, you'll have more control over time ranges, making it easier to investigate specific periods of interest and analyze data effectively. Here's what's included in this update:

- **Crosshair**. When you hover over a time series panel, Sumo Logic now displays a crosshair line with the time series data. If other time series panels are also configured with an overlapping time range, then when you hover over one time panel, a crosshair will be displayed on the other panels as well. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/panels/).

- **Time Syncing**. Using panel zoom feature you can now modify the time range of the dashboard to zoom in for granular details. This time range is considered as a temporary time range and all the other panels in the dashboard will be zoomed in for the selected time range. [Learn more](/docs/dashboards/set-custom-time-ranges).
