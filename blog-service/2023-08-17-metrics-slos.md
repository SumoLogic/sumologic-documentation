You can now use [metrics operators](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators) in SLO queries. The metrics query specified in your SLO should have a quantization specified after the selector. You can specify one or more operators in the query for SLO. [Learn more](/docs/observability/reliability-management-slo/create-slo/#create-an-slo-from-metrics-page).
