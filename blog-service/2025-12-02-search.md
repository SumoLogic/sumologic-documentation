We're excited to announce the ability to run log search queries and dashboard queries directly across multiple child orgs under a parent org. Previously, you could only query across one child org under a parent org. Going forward, you can now query across multiple child orgs, making it easier to dive into multi org-specific insights while staying connected at the parent org level.
