We're excited to announce the release of the new MS Graph Azure AD Reporting app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic's [Cloud-to-Cloud MS Graph Azure AD Reporting source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/ms-graph-azure-ad-reporting-source/) to provide insights into usage of Azure AD platform and identify potential security issues. Here are some of the key features that this app offers:

- **Analyze Audit Activities**. Provides real-time user activity for every resource category and shows the distribution of audits by operations and services.
- **Monitor Sign-In activities**. Monitor sign-in activities for your organization, including the number of successful and failed sign-ins, sign-ins by user location, sign-ins by application, and sign-ins from risky countries.
- **Identify Suspicious Activities**. Identify suspicious activity, such as sign-ins from unfamiliar/risky locations or multiple sign-in attempts.
- **Analyze Provisioning Activities**. Provides distribution of provisioning activities by status, actions, and initiators. It also shows the most frequent service principals used while provisioning.
