We've added a new Real User Monitoring script property, `getOverriddenServiceName`, that allows you to set up a service name dynamically and override the service name of a span during its creation.

You can use `getOverriddenServiceName` to create different services for different sub-parts of your website. For example, you could create unique service names for micro-frontends. [Learn more](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/real-user-monitoring/#step-1-create-a-rum-http-traces-source).
