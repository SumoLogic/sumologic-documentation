We're excited to announce the release of Metrics DPM, a new screen that provides detailed metrics data points per minute (DPM) information.

Metrics DPM answers the question “What things are sending metrics data, and how much are they sending?” Metrics DPM not only provides high level information about the metrics volume (DPM), but also breaks it down by individual metric names, as well as specific dimensions like cluster, host, and source. With this information, you can determine the items that contribute most to your credit consumption.  

To view the new screen, navigate to **Manage Data > Metrics > Metrics DPM**.
