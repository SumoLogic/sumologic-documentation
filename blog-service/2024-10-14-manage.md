We're excited to announce that when you create a role, you can select **Index Access** to restrict access to data in specific indexes. In addition, when you now select **Search Filter**, you can create filtering to restrict access to log analytics, audit, and security data. These enhancements ensure that users only see the data they are supposed to. 

This feature was [previously only available to participants in our beta program](/release-notes-service/2023/12/31/#october-27-2023-manage-account). It is now available for general use.

:::note
These changes are rolling out across deployments incrementally and will be available on all deployments by December 16, 2024.
