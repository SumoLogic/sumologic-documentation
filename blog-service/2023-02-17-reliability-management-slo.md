New - We've released SLO Lookup Tables, which allow you to view all SLO metadata in your environment. Data is managed and refreshed automatically on our end. To use, you can enlist the contents of the lookup table, which reside under a fixed path (`sumo://content/slos`) or join the results of your SLO precomputed data (from `_view = sumologic_slo_output`) with metadata contained in the lookup table. [Learn more](/docs/observability/reliability-management-slo/create-slo#slo-lookup-tables).
