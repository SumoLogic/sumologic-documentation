We’re excited to introduce Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence, a new feature set that enables you to seamlessly import threat intelligence indicator files directly into Sumo Logic to aid in security analysis. Threat intelligence indicators are individual data points about threats that are gathered from external sources about various entities such as host names, file hashes, IP addresses, and other known targets for compromise. Sumo Logic Threat Intelligence will help you stay ahead of emerging threats and enhance your security posture.

To see threat intelligence indicators, go to **Manage Data > Logs > Threat Intelligence**. Once you ingest indicators and they appear on the **Threat Intelligence** tab, you can use them to search logs for threats.
