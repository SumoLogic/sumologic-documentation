Weâ€™re excited to announce a new way to use threat intelligence in Sumo Logic. You can import files containing threat intelligence indicators directly into Sumo Logic to aid in security analysis. Threat intelligence indicators are individual data points about threats that are gathered from external sources about various entities such as host names, file hashes, IP addresses, and other known targets for compromise. 

To see threat intelligence indicators, go to **Manage Data > Logs > Threat Intelligence**. Once you ingest indicators and they appear on the Threat Intelligence tab, you can use them to search logs for threats.
