Copilot now supports multi-turn conversations, allowing you to ask follow-up questions without repeating your original search context. This makes investigations more natural and iterative: refine queries, adjust units or percentiles, dig deeper into results, and explore related suggestions. Enhancements include:  

* **Clarifications when needed**. If your request is ambiguous, Copilot may ask a follow-up question to narrow intent.  
* **Smarter error handling**. Contextual error messages explain why a query failed and suggest fixes.  
* **Guided exploration**. Intent cards summarize your goal, while suggestion cards offer refinements with a click.  
* **Conversation pane**. See your prompts, refinements, and results in one place, with history you can revisit or branch from.  
* **Dashboard-aware translations via RAG**. Copilot references recent dashboard queries (last 90 days) to improve accuracy.  

This feature is in Beta. To participate, contact your Sumo Logic account executive or our Support Team. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot-multiturn-beta).
