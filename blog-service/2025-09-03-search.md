Copilot now supports **multi-turn conversations**, letting you refine queries through natural follow-up questions without repeating your original search. In Beta, Copilot also introduces:

* **Ask back for clarification** when a request is ambiguous
* **More accurate translations** grounded in your orgâ€™s dashboards
* **Improved error handling** with clearer fallback messages

These enhancements make investigations more natural and iterative, helping you refine results, dig deeper, and troubleshoot faster.

This feature is available in the new Sumo Logic UI for all users with Copilot access. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot-multiturn-beta).
