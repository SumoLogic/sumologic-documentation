Copilot now supports multi-turn conversations, allowing you to ask follow-up questions without repeating your original search context. This enhancement enables more natural, iterative investigations. Copilot keeps track of your query history so you can refine searches, dig deeper into results, and troubleshoot faster.

This feature is available in the new Sumo Logic UI for all users with Copilot access. [Learn more](/docs/search/copilot/).
