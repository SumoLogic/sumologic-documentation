To help you get the most from your trial and clearly understand what happens next, we've outlined what to expect after your 30-day Flex free trial.

* **Days 0–30**. Enjoy full access to ingest data, create dashboards, search logs, set up alerts, and explore the platform.
* **Days 31–37**. Data ingestion pauses. You can continue querying your existing data for 7 days based on your retention settings.
* **Days 38–68**. Keep exploring with Kickstart Data, a curated set of sample data and dashboards that let you try features like search, dashboards, and alerts.
* **Day 69+**. All data, including Kickstart, is removed. You can still log in to view your dashboards and will see an upgrade prompt to continue using Sumo Logic.

This helps ensure a focused, hands-on evaluation during your trial, followed by clear options for upgrading when you're ready.

This update applies only to [Flex](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/sumo-logic-flex-accounts) trial accounts created after ***[DATE]***. It does not affect existing customers or other trial types such as AWS Marketplace and credits-based trials.
