The Sumo Logic MCP Server, now in closed beta, lets you connect your own AI tools to Sumo Logic using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

It enables external copilots, proprietary models, and third-party AI tools to securely query logs, investigate SIEM insights, manage alerts and dashboards, and work with existing Dojo AI agents using natural language from IDEs and chat platforms.

* **Bring your own AI**. Connect proprietary or third-party AI tools using the MCP standard.
* **Enable conversational workflows**. Perform multistep investigations and actions across tools using natural language.
* **Maintain secure access**. All interactions use OAuth-based authentication and existing Sumo Logic permission controls.
* **Work alongside Dojo AI agents**. Extend workflows by combining external AI tools with native Sumo Logic agents.

This capability is separately licensed. Contact your Sumo Logic account executive for closed beta access.
