The Sumo Logic MCP Server, now in closed beta, lets you connect your own AI tools to Sumo Logic using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

It enables external copilots, proprietary models, and third-party AI tools to securely query logs, investigate SIEM insights, manage alerts and dashboards, and work with existing Dojo AI agents using natural language from IDEs and chat platforms.

* Bring-your-own AI using the MCP standard
* Conversational, multi-step workflows across tools
* Secure, permissioned access with OAuth authentication
* Works alongside existing Dojo AI agents

This capability is separately licensed. Contact your Sumo Logic account executive for closed beta access.
