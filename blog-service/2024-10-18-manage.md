We are happy to introduce our new **Usage Management** tab under the **Accounts** section, which allows you to define spending limits for queries to prevent unexpected charges. They help you to manage Sumo Logic credits, especially in pay-per-use scenarios, by setting limits on search volume.

Below are some of the key features that this feature offers:

- **Org-Wide Query Budget**. Set a budget for queries that applies to all users in the organization.
- **User-Level Query Budget**. Set a budget for queries at the user level. With this, *Admins* will be able to specify roles and easily select groups based on roles.
- **Flexible Actions**. Provides flexibility in your actions when the budget limit is reached. You can choose between **Show Warning to the user** or **Only allow background query scans** actions.

Explore our technical documentation [here](/docs/manage/manage-subscription/usage-management/) to learn how to set up and use the Scan Budgets.
