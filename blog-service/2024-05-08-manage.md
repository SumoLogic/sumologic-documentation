To provide you with clearer visibility regarding the assignment of enriched data (through [Fields](/docs/manage/fields/)) to the original ingested log messages, we are launching the `extractedAndCollectedFieldsSize` property. This feature will now be visible in every relevant log line of the data volume index, enhancing your understanding of the enriched data integration process.

Following are enhanced log lines showing the property:

```
{"field":"vibs_inf","dataTier":"Infrequent","sizeInBytes":10539077,"extractedAndCollectedFieldsSize":445829,"count":3092},
{"field":"epd_dev_inf","dataTier":"Infrequent","sizeInBytes":39698534,"extractedAndCollectedFieldsSize":19835099,"count":130358}
```

We are rolling out this change progressively, and it will soon to be enabled for you.

For more examples of the `extractedAndCollectedFieldsSize` property in use, see [Data Volume Index Message Format](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/data-volume-index/log-tracing-data-volume-index/#data-volume-index-message-format) and the query example in [Data not sent alert](/docs/manage/ingestion-volume/monitor-ingestion-receive-alerts/#data-not-sent-alert).
