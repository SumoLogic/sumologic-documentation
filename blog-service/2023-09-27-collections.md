We're excited to announce the release of our new cloud-to-cloud source for Cisco Vulnerability Management. This source collects assets and vulnerabilities data using the [Asset API](https://apidocs.kennasecurity.com/reference/search-assets) and [Vulnerability API](https://apidocs.kennasecurity.com/reference/search-vulnerabilities).
