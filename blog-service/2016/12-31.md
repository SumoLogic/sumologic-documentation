Also, the Usage Reports page has been removed, as that information is now on the Accounts page.

**Change the Name of the Org.** The Account Owner can change the display name of their Organization. This can be useful if you are using Multi-account Access to switch between several Sumo Logic Organizations. See the [Account Usage](/docs/manage/manage-subscription) page for your account type for more information.

**Multiline Processing Enabled by Default in the UI.** Multiline processing for Sources is now enabled by default in the Sumo Logic Source Configuration UI, to be consistent with the API configuration.

### April 20, 2016

**Sumo Logic Multi-account Access.** For users with accounts in multiple deployments, [Multi-account Access](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/multi-account-access) allows you to log into multiple Sumo Logic accounts (also called organizations) using one username (email address) and password. If the same username already exists in more than one Sumo Logic organization, the accounts are linked automatically. No action is required, though initially, you will be asked to change your password. When you do, this will become your multi-account password. After you log into Sumo Logic, in the menu under your name, you will see the list of organizations that you can access under **Switch Org**.

**IMPORTANT:** Single account users are unaffected by Multi-account Access, and will not see this option in the UI.

**Other important notes:**


* Sumo Logic Multi-account users may have access to organizations that use different [Password Policies](/docs/manage/security/set-password-policy). With Multi-account, the password policy data from different organizations is centralized.
* For Multi-account users, Collector registration with username and password is longer supported. Multi-account users must use the token or accessid/access key option.
* Also, with Multi-account, to use the API, like with Collectors, you will not be able to log in using a username and password. You will be required to use an Access ID and Access Key.

For complete details, see [Multi-account Access](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/multi-account-access).


### April 15, 2016

**Search the Library for Content Types.** In the **Library**, in the **Personal** folder, you can now use the search field to search for certain content types. For example, you could enter type:search and the results would list all saved searches. You may also search for folders, Dashboards, and Scheduled Searches. For complete details see [Search the Library](/docs/get-started/library).


### April 12, 2016

<img src={useBaseUrl('img/release-notes/service/archive/4-12-16.png')} alt="image"/>

**Scheduled searches are retained when a user is deleted. **Previously, when a user account was [deleted](/docs/manage/users-roles/users/delete-user) from Sumo, the user's content was added to a "Content from deleted user..." folder in an Admin account, but scheduled searches were stopped.  Now, schedule information associated with searches is retained, even when a user account is deleted. Notifications continue to arrive via email to the same recipients.


### April 6, 2016


**Preview Tab in the Library, Featuring Preview Apps.** Preview Apps (the Preview Apps section was deleted in 2022) are Sumo Logic Apps that are currently under development, but are not yet released or officially supported. They appear in the Library under the **Preview** tab. You can install and use Preview Apps to test how well their use cases work for you, and provide feedback to Sumo Logic.

Because Preview Apps are not fully developed, they are not officially supported by Sumo Logic Support, and documentation instructions are not final.

**LogCompare.** [LogCompare](/docs/search/logcompare) allows you to compare a section of your log messages from one point in time with the same section at another point in time, and display the changes in patterns. For example, you could use LogCompare to determine if your last software deployment has broken something. To use LogCompare, run a search query with non-aggregate results, then click the LogCompare button in the Messages tab. This automatically compares the current query result with the result of the same query 24 hours in the past to show what has changed.LogCompare to determine if your last software deployment has broken something.

**Date Format preference.** On the [Preferences](/docs/get-started/account-settings-preferences) page, you can now choose an option for Date Format, which sets how dates appear on the Search page and in saved searches. Changing this from the default option (which uses your browser's default date format) has no affect on collection or timestamps of logs.

The Live Tail user interface mimics the command line with a solid black background and easy to read white text. It provides all log messages as they come in, with low latency.

You can start and filter a Live Tail session using the following supported metadata categories: `_sourceHost`, `_sourceCategory`, `_sourceName`, `_source`, and `_collector`.

Other Live Tail features include multiple Live Tail sessions, opening your Live Tail query in the Search page (or Show in Search), opening your Live Tail session in a new "pop-out" window, and changing the preferences of your Live Tail display, including line spacing, message text size, and message color.
