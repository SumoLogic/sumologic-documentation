#### Apps

New - The SDO App now provides a [Software Development Optimization - Development & Delivery Times](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/sdo/view-sdo-dashboards) dashboard to help you monitor development lead times and delivery lead times across the three main phases of development and delivery: Active Development, Review and Merge, and Deployment. Each section shows the phases broken down by team, service, and environment.
