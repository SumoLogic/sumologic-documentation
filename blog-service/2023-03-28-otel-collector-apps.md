Weâ€™re happy to announce our new and improved data onboarding workflow that gets you up and running with infrastructure monitoring in minutes. Out-of-the-box, you can start monitoring host and process data, web servers (like IIS, Nginx), databases (like MySQL, Redis, Cassandra), and other sources using our OpenTelemetry collector. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/quickstart).

The Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry, a single unified agent to send Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Metadata, helps simplify and streamline Observability and debugging to improve overall system reliability and efficiency. [Learn more](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector).
