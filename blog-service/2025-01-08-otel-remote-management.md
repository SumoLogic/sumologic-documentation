The Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector now supports remote management, enabling you to configure and manage data collection directly from the Sumo Logic UI. With this feature, you can:  

* **Simplify configuration**. Set up and manage data collection for multiple collectors without server access.  
* **Streamline workflows**. Use tags to group collectors and apply centralized data source templates, reducing redundancy and manual effort.  
* **Enhance automation**. Automatically monitor new servers by tagging them during setup.  
* **Accelerate time to value**. Start collecting data in minutes with an intuitive UI and no need to manage configuration files.  

This release provides a faster, more efficient way to manage large-scale data collection, supporting scalable and automated operations. [Learn more](/docs/send-data/opentelemetry-collector/remote-management).
