#### Traces

New - Number of [spans](https://help.sumologic.com/apm/traces/working-with-tracing-data/spans) per Trace has been increased by 10 times to 10000 spans per trace to better support monitoring for long running and complex transactions. Please note that new spans can increase credits consumption.

Update - Traces logs and data includes a new `duration` field that holds the difference between `endTimestamp` and `startTimestamp` in nanoseconds.
