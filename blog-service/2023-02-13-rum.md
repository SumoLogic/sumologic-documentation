New - Real User Monitoring (RUM) dashboards now have additional explore level and capabilities that allow you to filter by deployment environment. To leverage this, you'll need to add the `deployment.environment` tag and value that corresponds to your development environment (like `us-west-1`, `prod`, `dev`) as a custom attribute to your RUM script.
