We're excited to announce the release of the new Rapid7 app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Rapid7 source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/rapid7-source/) to gain deeper insights into asset and vulnerability management activities and prioritize remediation efforts, to minimize attack surfaces, and make well-informed decisions to enhance your overall security posture.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/rapid7) to learn how you can set up and use the Rapid7 app for Sumo Logic.
