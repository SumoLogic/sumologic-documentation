We are excited to annouce a bunch of improvements to our AWS Observability solution.  

* **AWS Observability Hub**. A landing page to access all the capabilities of the AWS Observability solution including the Out of box dashboards, alerts, and perforamnce benachmark reports all from a single place.
* **Log Searches for Troubleshooting**. Quickly troubleshoot issues within your AWS enviroment with pre baked log seaches. No need to learn the query syntax. These new searches can be accessed from the new hub page.

To learn more about the AWS Observability solution and to setup it up, check out our documentation [here](/docs/observability/aws/). 

:::note
To access these new capabilities you just have to install the AWS Observability solution. If you have one already installed, congraulations, you will gain access to these new features automatically.
