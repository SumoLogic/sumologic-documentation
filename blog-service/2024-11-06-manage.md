We know that getting started with new tools can be challenging, so we’ve introduced a new feature to make your trial experience with Sumo Logic as smooth as possible. With preloaded placeholder data, you can jump right in and explore the platform without having to set up your own data first.

Whether you're a developer, engineer, or working in DevOps or SecOps, this feature allows you to experience Sumo Logic’s value right away, helping you focus on what really matters—monitoring your activity and detecting issues before they become problems.

## Key benefits

* **See the value right away**. Jump in and explore how Sumo Logic works, without the hassle of setting up your own data first. This helps you quickly get a feel for the platform and decide if it’s the right fit for you.
* **Easy setup**. Preloaded placeholder data eliminates technical hurdles such as firewall configurations and security permissions, reducing your setup time and simplifying your onboarding process.
* **Guided experience**. Dive into pre-built dashboards and reports that show you how the platform works in real-world scenarios, so you can get the most out of your trial.
* **Safe exploration**. Explore the platform without exposing any sensitive data, providing you with a safe environment to fully assess Sumo Logic's features.

By reducing technical friction during your trial, this onboarding workflow helps you quickly unlock the platform's full potential, making it easier to decide if Sumo Logic is the right fit for your needs.

## How it works

1. **User assignment**. When you start your trial, you will be automatically assigned to either the placeholder data workflow or the custom data workflow, based on your user profile.
2. **Preloaded sample data**. If you are assigned the placeholder data option, sample data will be preloaded into the platform, along with dashboards and log searches tailored to your use cases, such as Monitoring & Troubleshooting (M&T) or Compliance & Security (CIS).
3. **Onboarding checklist**. You will follow a guided checklist that helps you:
   - Analyze sample data.
   - Perform log searches.
   - Invite team members to join and explore the platform with you.
4. **Seamless transition to real data**. After you complete the sample data onboarding steps, you can set up your own data ingestion while continuing to use the platform’s core features.
5. **Sample data deactivation**. The placeholder data will automatically be deactivated at the end of your trial period.

## Limitations

* **User profiling for selection**. Your assignment to either placeholder data or your own data workflow is determined by user profiling data from marketing. You won't be able to manually select your preferred workflow.
* **Limited availability**. At launch, the placeholder data option will only be available to select trial users based on profiling.
