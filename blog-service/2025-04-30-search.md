Weâ€™ve introduced a new Log Search parsing mode called Intelliparse mode, which extends automatic parsing to unstructured logs.

Highlights:

* Automatically parses unstructured log messages using parsers discovered from your existing dashboards
* Extracted fields are available in search queries, filters, dashboards, and alerts
* No need for Field Extraction Rules (FERs) or manual parsing logic
* Powers [Copilot](/docs/search/copilot)'s ability to understand and generate insights from raw, unstructured log data

To try it out, contact your Sumo Logic account team to request beta access. [Learn more](/docs/search/get-started-with-search/build-search/intelliparse).
