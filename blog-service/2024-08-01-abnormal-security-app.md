We're excited to announce the release of the new Abnormal Security app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic [Cloud-to-Cloud Abnormal Security source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/abnormal-security-source/) to gain actionable insights and visualizations and helps you to prioritize and mitigate security incidents efficiently.

Check out our technical documentation [here](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/abnormal-security/) to learn how to set up and use the Abnormal Security app for Sumo Logic.
