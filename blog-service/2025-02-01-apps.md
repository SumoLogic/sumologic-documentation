We're excited to introduce the new JumpCloud Directory Insights app for Sumo Logic. This app provides a comprehensive visibility into authentication events, user activities, and security-related actions within your JumpCloud-managed environment. The pre-configured dashboards can help you to track failed login attempts, privileged access changes, and account lockouts in real-time to improve security and ensure organizational policy compliance.
