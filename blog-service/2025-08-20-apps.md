We're excited to introduce the new Vectra app for Sumo Logic. This app leverages the Sumo Logic Cloud-to-Cloud [Vectra source](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/cloud-to-cloud-integration-framework/vectra-source/) to collect the detections from the Vectra platform. It provides security analysts with visibility into security threats detected across networks, cloud environments, and endpoints. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/vectra/).
