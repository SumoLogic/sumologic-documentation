New - We are excited to announce support for Span Links is now available in Tracing. You can navigate between spans using hyperlinks in the metadata tab as well as search for spans in the trace query and span analytics areas. Span Links are part of [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/overview#links-between-spans) and should be added on the instrumentation side. Links can point to Spans inside a single Trace or across different traces and can represent, for example, batch operations where a span is initiated by multiple initiating spans. For more information, see [View and Investigate Traces.](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/apm/traces/Working-with-Tracing-data/View-and-investigate-traces)
