We're excited to announce that the Setup Wizard is now available in both the [**Classic UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui-classic/) and [**New UI**](/docs/get-started/sumo-logic-ui).

We are removing the **Integrate with Sumo Logic** tile, which offered only a limited subset of apps, and deprecating the old Setup Wizard in the Classic UI. To provide a clearer and more complete experience, you will now be directed to the Sumo Logic App Catalog, where all supported apps are available.

If you are still using the older version and experience issues, contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/support/s).
