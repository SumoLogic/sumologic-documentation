We're happy to include the **Timezone** field for the Scheduled Views. Previously, *America/Los_Angeles (Includes DST)* was considered as the default timezone. Going forward, you can select/edit the timezone of your choice. If you do not make a selection, the Scheduled View will default to the timezone preference in Sumo Logic.
