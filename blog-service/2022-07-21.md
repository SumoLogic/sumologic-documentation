Update - When you query high cardinality metrics, the results can be hard to read and interpret. The Metrics Explorer now offers aggregation tipsâ€”recommendations for adding an aggregation clause to high cardinality metrics queries. You can easily add the suggested clause to your query, or ignore the suggestion, as desired. For more information, see [Metric Aggregation Tips](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/metrics/Metric-Queries-Alerts/).
