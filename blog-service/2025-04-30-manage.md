We’ve launched a new Get Started onboarding page to help you hit the ground running in Sumo Logic. This personalized hub replaces the previous checklist and guides you through key actions such as:

* Ingesting cloud, SaaS, or on-prem log data with just a few clicks
* Exploring Kickstart Data dashboards with simulated real-world insights—no setup needed
* Installing curated apps from the App Catalog
* Using LiveTail to view real-time logs
* Inviting teammates to collaborate
* Navigating to the in-app pricing page to upgrade your plan

This redesigned experience simplifies setup, accelerates time to value, and provides clear next steps to help you make the most of your trial. [Learn more](/docs/get-started/quickstart).
