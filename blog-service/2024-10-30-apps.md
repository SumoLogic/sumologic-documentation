### New release

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of new Azure Database for MySQL, Azure App Service Plan, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch, and Cosmos DB for NoSQL apps for Sumo Logic.

- **Azure Database for MySQL**. Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service in the Microsoft cloud based on the MySQL Community Edition database engine. This integration helps in identifying slow queries, tracking database-level activity, including connection, administration, data definition language (DDL), and data manipulation language (DML) events. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-database-for-mysql).
- **Azure App Service Plan**. Azure App Service Plan defines a set of compute resources for a app service to run. This integration helps in monitoring memory, CPU, incoming and outgoing bandwidth, number of sockets and their states across all the instances of the plan. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-app-service-plan).
- **Amazon Bedrock**. Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/amazon-bedrock).
- **Amazon OpenSearch**. Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. An OpenSearch Service domain is synonymous with an OpenSearch cluster. Domains are clusters with the settings, instance types, instance counts, and storage resources that you specify. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/amazon-opensearch).
- **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL**. Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL and relational database for modern app development offering single-digit millisecond response times, automatic and instant scalability, along with guaranteed speed at any scale. This integration helps in monitoring the overall performance, failures, capacity, and operational health of all your Azure Cosmos DB resources. [Learn more](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure/azure-cosmos-db).
