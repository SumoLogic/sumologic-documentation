Update - The week of July 25, 2022, we’ll be releasing a new [role capability](https://help.sumologic.com/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities)—**Download Search Results**—that grants the permission to download log search results. This capability will be enabled for all roles. If you manage role capabilities using the Sumo Logic API or Terraform, when the new capability is released, you’ll need to add the “downloadSearchResults” capability to the capabilities list for each role that should be able to download search results.
