We are excited to announce the update of Azure Blob Storage Collector, featuring several enhancements and improvements. Here are some of the key highlights of this release:

**Upgraded Azure function runtime in BlockBlob reader**. The BlockBlob reader is upgraded from Azure function runtime version 1.x to 4.x, which improves performance, reliability, and compatibility with the latest Azure technologies.

**Support for Azure storage accounts in different regions**. Previously, the collection resources deployment and storage account region had to match. With this release, we have introduced a new user parameter called **StorageAccountRegion**, which allows you to specify a storage account in a different region than the collection resources deployment region, providing greater flexibility and scalability.

**JSON lines format support**. You can upload any JSON file in JSON lines format to send data to Sumo Logic. This update enables seamless integration, which allows you to efficiently process and analyze JSON line data for your application's needs.
