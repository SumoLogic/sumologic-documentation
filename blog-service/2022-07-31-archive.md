Archive of July 2022 Service Release Notes.


---
## July 29, 2022 (Metrics)

New - Our `metricsfromtrace `and `rummetricsfromtrace` metrics have a new metadata tag, `deployment.environment`, which is automatically created from same tag (part of OpenTelemetry specification) present in tracing data. In case the tag is not present in spans, `deployment.environment` is set to default. This tag can be used to build custom dashboards by environments (i.e., prod, staging, test). Support for this field in Explore views and out-of-the-box dashboards is coming soon.

## July 28, 2022 (Security)

New - The [role capability](docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities.md) we told you about [earlier](#july-18-2022-security) this month—**Download Search Results**—is now released. This capability, which grants the permission to download log search results, is enabled for all roles. Note that if you manage role capabilities using the Sumo Logic API or Terraform, you need to add the “downloadSearchResults” capability to the capabilities list for each role that should be able to download search results.

---
## July 22, 2022 (Apps)

New - The Sumo Logic App for [AWS EC2](docs/integrations/amazon-aws/ec2-cloudwatch-metrics.md) uses EC2 instance cloudwatch metrics & EC2 Cloudtrail events and displays them using predefined dashboards. The App provides dashboards with insights into KPIs related to CPU, disk, network, EBS, Health Status Check, and events from EC2 Cloudtrail.

Update - [Amazon Simple Notification Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) (SNS) is a pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications service for coordinating the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints and clients.

The Sumo Logic App for [Amazon SNS](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws) collects CloudTrail logs and CloudWatch metrics to provide insights into the operations and utilization of your SNS service. This includes tracking the most active topics, failures, errors, and geographical locations of SNS clients.

## July 21, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - When you query high cardinality metrics, the results can be hard to read and interpret. The Metrics Explorer now offers aggregation tips—recommendations for adding an aggregation clause to high cardinality metrics queries. You can easily add the suggested clause to your query, or ignore the suggestion, as desired. For more information, see [Metric Aggregation Tips](/docs/metrics/Metric-Queries-Alerts/).

## July 18, 2022 (Security)

Update - The week of July 25, 2022, we’ll be releasing a new [role capability](docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities.md)—**Download Search Results**—that grants the permission to download log search results. This capability will be enabled for all roles. If you manage role capabilities using the Sumo Logic API or Terraform, when the new capability is released, you’ll need to add the “downloadSearchResults” capability to the capabilities list for each role that should be able to download search results.

## July 15, 2022 (Apps)

Update - The Sumo Logic [AWS Lambda](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Lambda) App uses the Lambda logs via CloudWatch, CloudWatch Metrics, and the CloudTrail Lambda Data Events to visualize the operational and performance trends in all the Lambda functions in your account. The preconfigured dashboards provide insights into executions, memory and duration usage by function versions or aliases, errors, billed duration, function callers, IAM users, and threat details. This app is updated from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include new Dashboards for Request, Error, Resource Usage, and Performance Analysis. Also, it includes a new Dashboard for analyzing Threat Intel.

New - The Sumo Logic App for [AWS Network Load Balancer](docs/integrations/amazon-aws/network-load-balancer.md) (that is a load balancer working on 4 layer of OSI model) is using metrics to provide insights to ensure that your network load-balancers are operating as expected, backend hosts are healthy and to quickly identify errors.

### Observability

New - We’re pleased to announce our new in-product Kubernetes onboarding experience, which guides first-time users step by step through data collection setup (Orchestration, Infrastructure & App Data), the dashboard generation process, and alert monitors installation. To try it out, go to Sumo Logic > **App Catalog** > **Kubernetes** app > then follow the wizard steps. You can also refer to our new [Kubernetes Quickstart](/docs/observability/kubernetes/Quickstart) doc, which mirrors the in-product onboarding workflow.

### Collection

New - We’re pleased to announce the release of the [GCP Metrics Source](docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/google-source/gcp-metrics-source.md). The new source gives you visibility into Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure and managed services using an integrated Google Service account. You can collect metrics from 35 native GCP services, as well as from custom services running on GCP.

## July 13, 2022 (Manage)

Update - We have renamed our default partition from “Default Continuous Partition” to “sumologic_default”. Now you can directly query the data stored in the default partition, where all data is ingested unless explicitly routed into another partition. Any APIs that reference the default partition by its previous name, “Default Continuous Partition”, should be updated to refer to “sumologic_default” instead. For more information, see [Search the Default Partition](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/run-search-against-partition#Search-the-default-partition).

This app is updated from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all dashboards to Dashboards(New), additional Dashboards to analyze Request and Process Bytes, and Dashboard to monitor Threat Intel.

Update - The Sumo Logic App for [Amazon ElastiCache](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Elasticache) provides visibility into key event and performance analytics that enable proactive diagnosis and response to system and environment issues. Use the preconfigured dashboards for at-a-glance analysis of event status trends, locations, successes, and failures, as well as system health and performance metrics. The dashboards also have additional performance insights for Redis clusters. This app is updated from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all dashboards to Dashboards(New) and new Dashboards for Redis performance details and Command Latency.

Update - The Sumo Logic App for [AWS Application Load Balancer](/docs/integrations/amazon-aws/Application-Load-Balancer) uses CW logs and metrics to give you visibility into the health of your Application Load Balancer and target groups. Use the preconfigured dashboards to understand the latency, request and host status, threat intel, and HTTP backend codes by availability zone and target group. This app is updated from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all dashboards to Dashboards(New) and new Dashboards for Response Analysis, Target Group Response Analysis, and Request and Processed Bytes.

### Metrics

New - Care to comment? Now you can. In the [Metrics Explorer,](/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer) in Advanced Mode you can add comments to a metrics query and comment out portions of the query by using comment formatting. Comments are helpful for troubleshooting during query development, and also for other users who may use or edit your queries at a later date—comments you add will be visible in saved and shared queries. For more information, see [Comments in Metric Queries](/docs/metrics/metric-queries-alerts/metrics-explorer).

Update - The [eval](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators#eval) metrics operator has been enhanced to support a `_granularity` option that provides the length, in milliseconds, of the bucket used for quantization, for use in metric queries.


### Observability

New - We’re pleased to announce our new in-product Kubernetes onboarding experience, which guides first-time users step by step through data collection setup (Orchestration, Infrastructure & App Data), the dashboard generation process, and alert monitors installation. To try it out, go to Sumo Logic > **App Catalog** > **Kubernetes** app > then follow the wizard steps. You can also refer to our [Kubernetes Quickstart](/docs/observability/kubernetes/quickstart.md) doc, which mirrors the in-product onboarding workflow.

## July 7, 2022 (Metrics)

Update - We’ve improved our zoom-in feature for metric charts. Up until now, zooming into a metric chart simply increased the size of the chart. Now, for time series charts in which the query uses automatic quantization, when you zoom in the chart presents results based on more granular data: the bucket size across which results are quantized is reduced. For more information, see [Zoom in on a time series chart](/docs/metrics/metric-charts/interacting-metric-charts#Zoom-in-on-a-time-series-chart).

### Apps

New - The Sumo Logic AWS API Gateway App provides insights into API Gateway tasks while accepting and processing concurrent API calls throughout your infrastructure, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization, access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. This App was already part of the AWS observability solution and will now be available as a standalone app in the App catalog.

Update - The Sumo App for Amazon DynamoDB uses logs and metrics to provide operational insights into your DynamoDB. The App includes Dashboards that allow you to monitor key metrics, view the throttle events, errors, and latency, and help you plan the capacity of your DynamoDB instances. This App updates from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all dashboards to Dashboards(New) and adding a new threat intel Dashboard to the App.

Update - The Sumo Logic Amazon RDS App dashboards provide visibility into your Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) performance and operations. Preconfigured dashboards allow you to monitor critical metrics of your RDS cluster, including CPU, memory, storage, the network transmits and receive throughput, read and write operations, database connection count, disk queue depth, and more. Audit activity dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure. This app updates from the AWS observability solution in the App Catalog. Updates include upgrading all the dashboards to Dashboards(New). New Audit activity dashboards help you monitor activities performed on your RDS infrastructure and RDS instance-specific dashboard support for - Aurora and MySQL and Performance Insights dashboards.

Update - Sumo Logic and AWS are excited to announce an update to [Sumo Logic Integrations for AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sumo-logic-for-aws-organizations/). This solution allows joint customers of AWS and Sumo Logic to automate the integration of [AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/architecture.html)-compliant organizations with [Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM powered by AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-o622lpl6biu6s).

Our updates support Security Reference Architecture (SRA)-compliant setup of:

* AWS Security Hub
* Centralized logging of AWS Network Firewall and AWS WAF
* AWS Firewall Manager

New - We are happy to announce the release of [AWS Observability Installation Automation](docs/observability/aws/deploy-use-aws-observability/deploy-with-aws-cloudformation). This release enables a simplified method of deploying AWS Observability using default parameters with just one quick command requiring only Sumo Access Id and Key. This method features POSIX and PowerShell scripts to trigger the Cloud Formation template for creating a stack to enable complete visibility into your AWS account infrastructure's health and reliability.

### Alerts

Update -  We’re continuing to make [alerts and monitors](/docs/alerts/monitors) more customizable to give you control over how often you are notified. You can now:

* **Visually indicate Alerting Query**: For Metrics monitors with multiple query rows, we now visually indicate the alerting query row with a notification bell icon.
* **Improved JSON Validations for Connection Payloads**: We're enforcing stricter JSON validation during creation and updating of Connections to prevent errors that could cause notification failures in the future. There are two major validations that we have started enforcing:
    * If there is a trailing comma (`,`) after the last `"key": "value"` in the JSON Payload structure, we will error out.
    * If there are multiple keys with the same name at the same level within a JSON payload, we will throw an error.
* **Monitor Alerts/Recovery Condition changes**: We no longer support Log Monitors with an Alert threshold condition of “`less than 0`” or “`greater or equal to 0`” . This is because Log queries always result in `0` (when there is no data) or more (when there is data) rows, and monitors that were configured with these conditions were not firing alerts.
