### Cloud SOAR end-of-sale

As of November 1, 2025, Sumo Logic will no longer sell Cloud SOAR. Sumo Logic will continue to support Cloud SOAR for existing customers, but we will discontinue selling Cloud SOAR to new customers. Sumo Logic will instead focus on delivering automation and orchestration capabilities with the [Automation Service](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/).

Renewals are allowed currently since Cloud SOAR is not under end-of-support or end-of-life. However, we strongly recommend that rather than renewing Cloud SOAR, that instead you use the Automation Service to handle your SOAR needs.
