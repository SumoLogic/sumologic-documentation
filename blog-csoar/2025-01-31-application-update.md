### Changes and Enhancements

#### Platform

ðŸš€ **New Feature Release: Auto-Save for Playbooks**

  Weâ€™re excited to introduce Auto-Save for Playbooks, a feature designed to make workflow changes seamless by automatically saving your progress as draft and preventing accidental data loss. Here's **what's new**:

  * Playbooks now automatically save your changes, including node updates, connections, and position adjustments. 
  * Multiple changes made in quick succession are saved together to improve performance. 
  * Visual indicators display the saving status whether in progress, successfully saved, or failed. 
  * Warnings appear when users attempt to close or navigate away from a playbook with unsaved changes. 
  * Users can enable or disable auto-save as needed.

**AuditService**:
   * Removed the `Body` field from the email audit log to enhance security and optimize log storage

#### Bug Fixes

* **Playbooks**:
    * Fixed granular field path drill-down in textArea for arrays with array output fields. 
    * Resolved issue where the Authorizer value in playbook action nodes was not persisting on the UI.
