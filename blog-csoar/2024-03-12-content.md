Our Cloud SOAR [application update](/release-notes-csoar/2024/03/12/application-update/) features an important upgrade to Python 3.12 for our Lambda functions. This enhancement is part of our ongoing commitment to security, performance, and the latest technological standards.

The Python upgrade impacts a total of 38 integrations. These integrations will require updates to ensure compatibility with the new Python version.

Please be aware that with this update, the output from certain actions may no longer be displayed as expected if they were customized in your current setup. This is an important consideration for your workflows, and we recommend reviewing any customizations you have in place.

To facilitate a smooth transition, we have prepared a straightforward guide to assist you in updating your integrations. This guide outlines the steps you need to take to ensure your integrations work seamlessly with Python 3.12. <a href="https://help.sumologic.com/files/updating-app-central-integrations.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for the "Updating App Central Integrations" guide</a>.
