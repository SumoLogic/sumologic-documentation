### New feature: Playbook Executions

We are excited to announce that you can now monitor the outcome of playbook runs on the new **Playbook Executions** screen. The screen shows both currently running and completed playbook executions, with clear status and timestamps. The screen makes it easier to monitor automation health and troubleshoot playbook issues. [Learn more](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/playbooks/troubleshoot-playbooks/#playbook-executions).
