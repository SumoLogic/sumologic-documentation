## May release

### Changes and enhancements

#### New feature: Enable/disable playbooks

This feature allows users to easily enable or disable playbooks without deleting them, offering greater control over their execution.

What's new:
* Switch playbooks' status to enabled or disabled directly from the playbook details page.
* The playbooks listing page now shows a status column to display the status of the playbooks.
* Disabled playbooks will not execute from any linked triggers like monitors, insights, or incident rules, enhancing operational safety.
* By default, playbooks with any published version are set to enabled, while those that are draft-only or have been deleted remain disabled.
* Audit logs are generated whenever playbooks are enabled or disabled manually.

For more information, see [Enable or disable playbooks](/docs/platform-services/automation-service/automation-service-playbooks/#enable-or-disable-playbooks).

### Bug Fixes

#### Playbooks

* Fixed an issue where users were unable to use the "Answer by Email" option when selecting  the authorizer as a playbook input variable.
* Fixed long text getting cropped in filter and conditions nodes preview.

#### Rules

* Resolved an issue where empty keys within nested list objects were not properly filtered during rule execution. This fix ensures accurate evaluation of `isnot` and `notcontains` conditions by excluding empty keys, resulting in improved data processing accuracy and rule performance.

#### Incidents

* Resolved data loading issue on incidents and triage listing tables.
* Fixed issue related to user redirection to the logic page on session timeout.
