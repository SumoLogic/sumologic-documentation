### New in the Cloud SOAR SaaS version

We are excited to announce the following new features and enhancements in our Cloud SOAR SaaS version:
* New and improved features:
   * [Dashboards](/docs/cloud-soar/main-menu/#create-a-dashboard)
   * [Reports](/docs/cloud-soar/global-functions-menu#report)
   * [Create widgets for dashboards or reports](/docs/cloud-soar/main-menu#create-widgets-for-dashboards-or-reports)
   * Directly manage User Choice actions within the playbooks from your [Slack workspace](/docs/cloud-soar/automation/#configure-slack-for-cloud-soar).
 * Open Integration Framework updates:
    * [Integration Builder](/docs/cloud-soar/automation#integration-builder) allows you to build integrations without needing to provide code
   * Integrations, and related action execution, can be done [in the cloud or through the Bridge](/docs/cloud-soar/automation#cloud-or-bridge-execution). Only certified integrations can be executed in the cloud.
    * Certified integrations allow you to customize JSON and table output schema
    * Actions configuration during playbook design is rearranged for easier use
* Architectural improvements:
     * Fully-functional in the Cloud (the Bridge is only required for custom integrations)
     * User and profile management is in Sumo Logic core platform instead of Cloud SOAR
     * Automatic scalability based on server load
     * [Cloud SOAR APIs](/docs/api/cloud-soar/) are standardized to use the same infrastructure as APIs in the Sumo Logic core platform
