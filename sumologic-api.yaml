    # Getting Started
    Welcome to the Sumo Logic API reference. You can use these APIs to interact with the Sumo Logic platform. For information on the collector and search APIs see our [API home page](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs).
    ## API Endpoints
    Sumo Logic has several deployments in different geographic locations. You'll need to use the Sumo Logic API endpoint corresponding to your geographic location. See the table below for the different API endpoints by deployment. For details determining your account's deployment see [API endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3011).

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td> <strong>Deployment</strong> </td>
          <td> <strong>Endpoint</strong> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> AU </td>
          <td> https://api.au.sumologic.com/api/ </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> CA </td>

      </table>

    ## Authentication
    Sumo Logic supports the following options for API authentication:
    - Access ID and Access Key
    - Base64 encoded Access ID and Access Key

    See [Access Keys](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access-Keys) to generate an Access Key. Make sure to copy the key you create, because it is displayed only once.
    When you have an Access ID and Access Key you can execute requests such as the following:
      ```bash
      curl -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" -X GET https://api.<deployment>.sumologic.com/api/v1/users
      ```

    Where `deployment` is either `au`, `ca`, `de`, `eu`, `fed`, `in`, `jp`, `us1`, or `us2`. See [API endpoints](#section/API-Endpoints) for details.

    If you prefer to use basic access authentication, you can do a Base64 encoding of your `<accessId>:<accessKey>` to authenticate your HTTPS request. The following is an example request, replace the placeholder `<encoded>` with your encoded Access ID and Access Key string:
      ```bash
      curl -H "Authorization: Basic <encoded>" -X GET https://api.<deployment>.sumologic.com/api/v1/users
      ```


    Refer to [API Authentication](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3012) for a Base64 example.

    ## Status Codes
    Generic status codes that apply to all our APIs. See the [HTTP status code registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml) for reference.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td> <strong>HTTP Status Code</strong> </td>
          <td> <strong>Error Code</strong> </td>
          <td> <strong>Description</strong> </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 301 </td>
          <td> moved </td>
          <td> The requested resource SHOULD be accessed through returned URI in Location Header. See [troubleshooting](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Troubleshooting-APIs/API-301-Error-Moved) for details.</td>
        </tr>

          <td> The API request rate is higher than 4 request per second or inflight API requests are higher than 10 request per second. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 500 </td>
          <td> internal.error </td>
          <td> Internal server error. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 503 </td>
          <td> service.unavailable </td>
          <td> Service is currently unavailable. </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    ## Filtering
    Some API endpoints support filtering results on a specified set of fields. Each endpoint that supports filtering will list the fields that can be filtered. Multiple fields can be combined by using an ampersand `&` character.

    For example, to get 20 users whose `firstName` is `John` and `lastName` is `Doe`:
      ```bash
      api.sumologic.com/v1/users?limit=20&firstName=John&lastName=Doe
      ```

    ## Sorting
    Some API endpoints support sorting fields by using the `sortBy` query parameter. The default sort order is ascending. Prefix the field with a minus sign `-` to sort in descending order.

    For example, to get 20 users sorted by their `email` in descending order:
      ```bash
      api.sumologic.com/v1/users?limit=20&sort=-email
      ```

    ## Asynchronous Request
    Asynchronous requests do not wait for results, instead they immediately respond back with a job identifier while the job runs in the background. You can use the job identifier to track the status of the asynchronous job request. Here is a typical flow for an asynchronous request.
    1. Start an asynchronous job. On success, a job identifier is returned. The job identifier uniquely identifies
      your asynchronous job.

    2. Once started, use the job identifier from step 1 to track the status of your asynchronous job. An asynchronous
      request will typically provide an endpoint to poll for the status of asynchronous job. A successful response
      from the status endpoint will have the following structure:
      ```json
      {
          "status": "Status of asynchronous request",
          "statusMessage": "Optional message with additional information in case request succeeds",
          "error": "Error object in case request fails"
      }
      ```
      The `status` field can have one of the following values:
        1. `Success`: The job succeeded. The `statusMessage` field might have additional information.
        2. `InProgress`: The job is still running.
        3. `Failed`: The job failed. The `error` field in the response will have more information about the failure.

    3. Some asynchronous APIs may provide a third endpoint (like [export result](#operation/getAsyncExportResult))
      to fetch the result of an asynchronous job.


    ### Example
    Let's say we want to export a folder with the identifier `0000000006A2E86F`. We will use the [async export](#operation/beginAsyncExport) API to export all the content under the folder with `id=0000000006A2E86F`.
    1. Start an export job for the folder
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.<deployment>.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/0000000006A2E86F/export
      ```
      See [authentication section](#section/Authentication) for more details about `accessId`, `accessKey`, and
      `deployment`.
      On success, you will get back a job identifier. In the response below, `C03E086C137F38B4` is the job identifier.
      ```bash
      {
          "id": "C03E086C137F38B4"
      }
      ```

    2. Now poll for the status of the asynchronous job with the [status](#operation/getAsyncExportStatus) endpoint.
      ```bash
      curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.<deployment>.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/0000000006A2E86F/export/C03E086C137F38B4/status
      ```
      You may get a response like
      ```json
      {
          "status": "InProgress",
          "statusMessage": null,
          "error": null
      }
      ```
      It implies the job is still in progress. Keep polling till the status is either `Success` or `Failed`.

    3. When the asynchronous job completes (`status != "InProgress"`), you can fetch the results with the
      [export result](#operation/getAsyncExportResult) endpoint.
      ```bash
      curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.<deployment>.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/0000000006A2E86F/export/C03E086C137F38B4/result
      ```

      The asynchronous job may fail (`status == "Failed"`). You can look at the `error` field for more details.
      ```json
      {
          "status": "Failed",
          "errors": {
              "code": "content1:too_many_items",
              "message": "Too many objects: object count(1100) was greater than limit 1000"
          }
      }
      ```


    ## Rate Limiting
    * A rate limit of four API requests per second (240 requests per minute) applies to all API calls from a user.
    * A rate limit of 10 concurrent requests to any API endpoint applies to an access key.

    If a rate is exceeded, a rate limit exceeded 429 status code is returned.

    ## Generating Clients
    You can use [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) to generate clients from the YAML file to access the API.

    ### Using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
    1. Install [NPM package wrapper](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) globally, exposing the CLI
      on the command line:
      ```bash
      npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
      ```
      You can see detailed instructions [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation#npm).

    2. Download the [YAML file](/docs/sumologic-api.yaml) and save it locally. Let's say the file is saved as `sumologic-api.yaml`.
    3. Use the following command to generate `python` client inside the `sumo/client/python` directory:
      ```bash
      openapi-generator generate -i sumologic-api.yaml -g python -o sumo/client/python
      ```


    ### Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    1. Install OpenAPI Generator
      ```bash
      brew install openapi-generator
      ```

    2. Download the [YAML file](/docs/sumologic-api.yaml) and save it locally. Let's say the file is saved as `sumologic-api.yaml`.
    3. Use the following command to generate `python` client side code inside the `sumo/client/python` directory:
      ```bash
      openapi-generator generate -i sumologic-api.yaml -g python -o sumo/client/python
      ```

    You can export, import, delete and copy content in your organization’s Library. For more information see [Library](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=5173). You can perform the request as a Content Administrator by using the `isAdminMode` parameter. For more information see [Admin Mode](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Content_Sharing/Admin_Mode).
    <br/> <br/>
    ### Example
    The following example uses API endpoints in the US1 deployment. Sumo Logic has several deployments that are assigned depending on the geographic location and the date an account is created. For details determining your account's deployment see [API endpoints](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=3011).
    The [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) can be used to create or update a Search, Scheduled Search, or Dashboard. Here is an example creating a Scheduled Search:
    1. Get the identifier of your `Personal` folder.
      ```bash
      curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/personal
      ```

      Find the identifier of your `Personal` folder in the response.
      ```json
      {
          ...
          "id": "0000000006A2E86F", <----
          "name": "Personal",
          "itemType": "Folder",
          ...
      }
      ```

      You can use [getFolder](#operation/getFolder), [getAdminRecommededFolder](#operation/getAdminRecommendedFolderAsync),
      or [getGlobalFolder](#operation/getGlobalFolderAsync) endpoints to traverse the content tree and find the identifier of any
      folder you want to manage.

    2. Use the [Content Import API](#operation/beginAsyncImport) to create a new Scheduled Search inside your
      `Personal` folder.
      ```bash
      curl -X POST -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @search.json https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import
      ```

      The data file `search.json` in the above command has the following `SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition` object.
      ```json
      // file: search.json
      {
          "type": "SavedSearchWithScheduleSyncDefinition",
          "name": "demo-scheduled-search",
          "description": "Runs every hour with timerange of 15m and sends email notifications",
          "search": {
              "queryText": "\"error\" and \"warn\"",
              "defaultTimeRange": "-15m",
              "byReceiptTime": false,
              "viewName": "",
              "viewStartTime": null,
              "queryParameters": []
          },
          "searchSchedule": {
              "cronExpression": "0 0/15 * * * ? *",
              "displayableTimeRange": "-15m",
              "parseableTimeRange": {
                  "from": {
                      "relativeTime": "-15m",
                      "type": "RelativeTimeRangeBoundary"
                  },
                  "to": null,
                  "type": "BeginBoundedTimeRange"
              },
              "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles",
              "threshold": null,
              "notification": {
                  "taskType": "EmailSearchNotificationSyncDefinition",
                  "toList": [
                      "ops@acme.org"
                  ],
                  "subjectTemplate": "Search Results: {{SearchName}}",
                  "includeQuery": true,
                  "includeResultSet": true,
                  "includeHistogram": true,
                  "includeCsvAttachment": false
              },
              "muteErrorEmails": false,
              "scheduleType": "1Hour",
              "parameters": []
          }
      }
      ```

      The response of above request will have the job identifier that you can use to track the status of the import job.
      ```json
      {
          "id": "74DC17FA765C7443"
      }
      ```

    3. Use the job identifier from the import request to get the [status](#operation/getAsyncImportStatus) of the
      import job.
      ```bash
      curl -X GET -u "<accessId>:<accessKey>" https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/folders/0000000006A2E86F/import/74DC17FA765C7443/status
      ```

      If you are importing a large item, you might have to wait for the import job to finish. The following is an
      example response from a completed job.
      ```json
      {
          "status": "Success",
          "statusMessage": null,
          "error": null
      }
      ```

        _Path is specified in the required query parameter `path`. The path should be URL encoded._ For example, to get "Acme Corp" folder of a user "user@sumo.com" you can use the following curl command:
          ```bash
          curl https://api.sumologic.com/api/v2/content/path?path=/Library/Users/user%40sumo.com/Acme%20Corp
          ```


        The absolute path to a content item should be specified to get the item. The content library has "Library" folder at the root level. For items in "Personal" folder, the base path is "/Library/Users/user@sumo.com" where "user@sumo.com" is the email address of the user. For example if a user with email address `wile@acme.com` has `Rockets` folder inside Personal folder, the path of Rockets folder will be `/Library/Users/wile@acme.com/Rockets`.

        For items in "Admin Recommended" folder, the base path is "/Library/Admin Recommended". For example, given a folder `Acme` in Admin Recommended folder, the path will be `/Library/Admin Recommended/Acme`.

            A metric query consists of a metric, one or more filters and optionally, one or more [Metrics Operators](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=10144). Strictly speaking, both filters and operators are optional.

            Most of the [Metrics Operators](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=10144) are allowed in the query string except `fillmissing`, `outlier`, `quantize` and `timeshift`.

              * `fillmissing`: Not supported in API.
              * `outlier`: Not supported in API.
              * `quantize`: Only supported through `quantization` param.
              * `timeshift`: Only supported through `timeshift` param.


            In practice, your metric queries will almost always contain filters that narrow the scope of your query. For more information about the query language see [Metrics Queries](https://help.sumologic.com/?cid=1079).
