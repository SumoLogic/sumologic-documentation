# Build and Deploy on Local

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.

## Build your site

Build and deploy your site **for production** on your local. 

1. Open a terminal on your local machine.
1. Change directory to your GitHub repo.
1. Enter the following command to build and deploy:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder.

The `build` folder is now served at `http://localhost:3000/`.
