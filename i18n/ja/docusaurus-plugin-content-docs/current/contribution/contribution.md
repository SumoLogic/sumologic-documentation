# Contributing to Sumo

We welcome contributions for updates, new pages, tutorials, and more for the Sumo Logic Documentation site.

This guide provides information on our markdown, creating files, adding them to the navigation sidebar, and more.

Additional content will be added as needed. You can also learn more in our GitHub [Wiki](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation/wiki) and [Repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-documentation).

:::sumo Welcome to the Theme Demo
This site is an example of what Sumo Logic documentation could look like running on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is built on React, open source tools, site generator, with a thriving community and development team. 

It leverages and supports all React, Remark, Rehype, and custom plugins and code. It comes with an easily customizable theme out of the box with a dark/light mode, fully responsive, internationalization translations, versions, and so much more.
