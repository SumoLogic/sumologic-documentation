New - Announcing general availability of dashboard support for Trace Spans data index. You can now pin results of your queries on spans data directly to the Dashboard. You can add the query through the Log Search screen when running queries in `_trace_spans` index as long as your read volume does not exceed 200x of your tracing ingest ([more info](https://help.sumologic.com/Traces/02Working_with_Tracing_data/Search_Query_Language_support_for_Traces)). Support for doing this directly from the Spans analytics window is coming soon.
