description: Monitors continuously query your logs or metrics and send notifications when specific events occur. You can send notifications to Connections for three thresholds, critical, warning, and missing data. Each threshold can have one or more notifications sent for an alert and recover condition.
---

Sumo Logic Monitors allow you to set robust and configurable alerting policies that enable you to get notified about critical changes or issues affecting your production application.

Monitors track your Metrics or Logs data in real time and send notifications when noteworthy changes happen in your production applications.

:::

## Rules

* You need the **Manage** or **View Monitors** [role capability](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/role-capabilities.md)) to manage or view Monitors respectively.
* The frequency a Monitor executes depends upon a variety of factors such as the underlying query, the operators used, and the detection window. It can vary from a couple of seconds to a few minutes. If for example, the detection window of your alert is one day it will be evaluated every couple of minutes, whereas if the detection window of the monitor is 15 minutes then it will be evaluated every couple of seconds.
* Log Monitors use the [role search filter](/docs/manage/users-roles/roles/construct-search-filter-for-role.md) of their creator.
* Log Monitors delay execution by two minutes. This means it won't evaluate data from the current time, but evaluate data from two minutes ago.  This ensures that any delays in ingestion are factored in and won't generate false positive or false negative alerts.
* Metric Monitors delay execution by one minute.
* Depending on your account type, you can have up to a certain number of Log and Metric Monitors.

  * Enterprise and Trial can have up to 1,000 Log Monitors and 500 Metric Monitors.
  * Essentials and Professional can have up to 300 Log Monitors and 500 Metric Monitors.
  * Free can have up to 50 Log Monitors and 50 Metric Monitors.

## Limitations

* [Receipt Time](../../search/get-started-with-search/build-search/use-receipt-time.md) is not supported.
* Monitors only support the [Continuous data tier](/docs/manage/partitions-data-tiers/data-tiers.md).
* An aggregate Metric Monitor can evaluate up to 15,000 time series. A non-aggregate Metric Monitor can evaluate up to 3,000 time series.
* [Save to Index](../scheduled-searches/save-to-index.md) and [Save to Lookup](../scheduled-searches/save-to-lookup.md) are not supported.
* [Search templates](../../search/get-started-with-search/build-search/search-templates.md) are not supported.
* A Log Monitor can have one query up to 4,000 characters long. Metric Monitors can specify up to six queries.
* Email notifications can have up to 100 recipients.
* [Dynamic Parsing](../../search/get-started-with-search/build-search/dynamic-parsing.md) (auto-parse mode) is not supported.
* The timeshift [metrics operator](/docs/metrics/metrics-operators) is not supported in a Metric Monitor.
* [Hidden Metrics queries](../../metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer.md) do not persist across edit sessions.
* The last millisecond of the defined time range is not searched. For example, a time range of 6:15 to 6.30 pm will run as 6:15:00:000 to 6:29:59:999.

## Notifications

Notifications are optional and available as an **alert** and **recovery** for each trigger condition you specify, **critical**, **warning**, and **missing**.

### Alert

* Monitors keep track of the notifications it sends and won't send additional notifications after sending the first one if the incident persists. It will only send additional notifications if there is a major change in the state of the monitor, such as new triggers from Warning to Critical or a different time series is detected.
* When more than one trigger condition is met notifications are sent based on the trigger conditions:
  * When both Critical & Warning conditions are met two separate notifications are generated, one for the Critical condition and one for the Warning condition. Auto resolution, if set up, will work according to the resolution condition for each case. 
  * When the Missing Data condition is met after initially firing a critical/warning incident the system will resolve the Critical or Warning incident that was created with the appropriate resolution reason. The system will also create a new Missing Data incident and notify you appropriately using your configured notification channel.
* Metric Monitors have the option to group notifications. When configured, the Monitor will not trigger new notifications until the first one is resolved. The Monitor will only update if the notification type supports Auto Resolution. Grouped notifications will resolve when all the time series return to normal.
* Log Monitors always group notifications.

### Recovery

* Recovery is based on the detection window, which is either the time range or the number of data points of the trigger condition. An alert is recovered (resolved) when the recovery condition is met for the entire duration of the detection window. For example, if an alert is triggered at 1 PM and the detection window is 15 minutes, the earliest the alert would recover is after 1:15 PM since the entire detection window must pass. This is to ensure there isn't an alert between the triggered and resolved state, especially for metrics that are volatile.
* Auto Resolution is supported with Email, Lambda, Microsoft Teams, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Slack, and generic webhook connections. Support for other connection types is coming soon.
  * For Lambda and generic webhooks, the same payload for both alerts and recovery is used.
  * Email, Microsoft Teams, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, and Slack recovery notifications are hardcoded by Sumo Logic and cannot be edited. The recovery payload is not the same as the alert payload.
* The recovery notification is sent to the same channel where the corresponding Alert notifications were sent. In other words, you cannot have different channels where you receive alert and recovery notifications for a given trigger condition.
* After one day without new data to an incident, the system automatically expires it. The incident is marked as resolved with the resolution set to **Expired**.

## Tools

* [Monitor resource in Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SumoLogic/sumologic/latest/docs/resources/monitor) 
* [Monitor management API](/docs/api/Monitor_Management_API.md)

## Monitors page

The Monitors page allows you to view, create, and manage Monitors. You can create and organize your Monitors into folders. To access the page go to **Manage Data** \> **Monitoring** \> **Monitors**.

![monitors page](/img/monitors/monitors-page.png)

The page displays the following information:

* **Name**. Name of the Monitor.
* **Status**. A Monitor is considered **Normal** when none of the trigger conditions are met and your data is actively being monitored.
* **Type**. A Monitor type is either Logs or Metrics, based on the type of data being monitored.
* **Query**. The query the Monitor is running to track your data.
* **Created By**. The user that created the Monitor.
* **Last Modified**. The time the Monitor was last updated.
* **Capacity Used**. The bottom of the table shows the number of Log and Metric Monitors in your account.

To quickly open the [Alert List](alert-response.md) to view all of the triggered alerts from a Monitor hover your cursor over its Status and click the icon.

![monitor shortcut.png](/img/monitors/monitors-shortcut.png)

At the top of the page, you can:

* **Search Monitors**. Use the search field to filter Monitors by name and status. For example, you can view all Monitors that are currently triggered in the system by clicking the **Status: All Triggered**.

    ![search monitors input.png](/img/monitors/search-monitors-input.png)

* Click **Add** to:   

![Add monitors page.png](/img/monitors/Add-monitors-page.png)

  * create folders for organizing your Monitors.
  * create a [new Monitor](#add-a-monitor).
  * import Monitors from the exported JSON you copied from the **More Actions** menu in the [Details pane](#details-pane) of the original monitor.

    :::important
    The Import function is provided for you to transfer data immediately. The Sumo Logic JSON format may change without notice. There is no guarantee that you will be able to import the JSON in the future.
    :::

### Quick menu

The quick menu allows you to make changes to the Monitor without opening the Details pane. Find and hover your mouse over a Monitor in the Monitors table. A three-dot kebab icon appears on the right of the row. Click the three-dot kebab icon to view a menu with all of the options available in the [Details pane](#details-pane).

![quick menu](/img/monitors/quick-menu-monitors.png)

## Details pane

The details pane provides additional information about a selected Monitor, like its query, trigger conditions, and notification preferences. For the monitors listed, select a row to view its details. A details pane appears to the right of the table.

![monitor details](/img/monitors/monitor-details.png)

In the details pane you can see the following details for a Monitor:

* **Name** of the Monitor.
* The **status** of the Monitor, either Normal, Critical, Warning, or Missing Data. A Monitor can be in multiple states at the same time.
* **Description** of the Monitor.
* **Type** of Monitor, either Logs or Metrics.
* **Path** is the Library location where the Monitor is stored.
* **Query** used to track your data. 
* **Trigger Conditions** that are set on the Monitor. Applicable values include Critical, Warning, and Missing Data.
* **Notifications** configured on the Monitor.
* The timestamp and user that **Created** and last** Modified** the Monitor.

### Edit, Disable, More Actions

Use the **Edit** button to make changes to the selected Monitor.

The **Disable** button puts the Monitor in a disabled state so it will not fire any notifications.

Under the **More Actions** menu you can:

* [**Disable** and **Enable**](#edit-disable-more-actions). A Monitor that is in a disabled state will not fire any notifications.
* **Copy Path**. Copy the path of the Monitor to your computer clipboard.
* **Duplicate**. Make another Monitor based on the same settings.
* **Move**. Move the Monitor to a different path.
* **Export**. Provides JSON of the Monitor, allowing you to transfer content within Sumo Logic by copying this JSON, then pasting it into the import dialog in the [Library](/docs/get-started/library) location you choose. This JSON format may change without notice. 
* **Delete**.

![monitor more actions](/img/monitors/monitor-actions.png)

## Add a monitor

On the Monitors page (to access the page go to **Manage Data** \> **Monitoring** \> **Monitors**) click on the **Add** button then **New Monitor** to add a new Monitor. The creation dialog box will appear.

You can configure Sumo Logic Monitors using [Terraform modules](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor).

1. Select a **Monitor Type**, either Logs or Metrics.   

    ![trigger conditions for monitor.png](/img/monitors/trigger-conditions-monitor.png)

1. Select a **Detection Method**, either Static or Outlier.

    ![outlier detection method.png](/img/monitors/outlier-detection-method.png)

    * **Static** allows you to set specific threshold conditions. Use this detection method when you are alerting on KPIs that have well defined and constant thresholds for what's good and bad. For example, infrastructure metrics like CPU utilization, and memory.  
    * An **outlier** is an unusual change or a spike in a time series of a key indicator. Use this detection method when you are alerting on KPIs that don't have well-defined constant thresholds for what's good and bad. You want the Monitor to automatically detect and alert on unusual changes or spikes on the alerting query. For example, application KPIs like page request, throughput, and latency.  

1. Provide a **Query**. A Log Monitor can have one query up to 4,000 characters long. Metric Monitors can specify up to six queries. When providing multiple metrics queries use the letter labels to reference a query row, see [joined metrics queries](../../metrics/metrics-queries/metrics-explorer.md) for details. The Monitor will automatically deduce the query row to use for the trigger. 

1. **Outlier** detection methods require you to select the **Direction** you want to track. If you chose **Static**, you won't see this option.

    ![outlier detection input on Monitor.png](/img/monitors/outlier-detection-input.png)

    * **Up.** Only get alerted if there is an abnormal *increase* in the tracked key indicator. 
    * **Down.** Only get alerted if there is an abnormal *decrease* in the tracked key indicator.
    * **Both.** Get alerted if there is *any* abnormality in the data whether an increase or a decrease.

1. Specify the **Trigger Type**. A Monitor can have one critical, warning, and missing data trigger condition, each with one or more notification destinations. Triggers have different options depending on the query and alert type. Click the **Expand** button next to the query type you're using for configuration details.

![Logs monitors.png](/img/monitors/logs-monitors.png)

Trigger alerts on:

![trigger alerts on field.png](/img/monitors/trigger-alerts-field.png)

You can set the trigger based on the following:

* **returned row count** (default): the number of rows returned from the log search.
* A numeric field returned from the search. You can pick any numeric field from your query, and alert on the value of that field. The field is `_count` in the above screenshot. To convert a string to a number use the [num operator](/docs/search/search-query-language/search-operators/num). For example, if you have a field named **duration** you would use the num operator as follows to convert it to a number value.

  `    | num(duration)`

1. (Optional) **Additional Settings** has an **Evaluation Delay** setting. Collection delays may occur due to your environment and it takes a couple of minutes for data to be processed into Sumo Logic. Since Monitors run on data from the most current time period, it's possible for Monitors to evaluate against incomplete data. As a result, Monitors can generate false positives or negatives that can cause confusion. Set an evaluation delay in seconds to delay the evaluation of a Monitor, so it doesn't look at the most current time (where data can be incomplete) and instead looks at an older period of time, where you have more complete data.

    ![additional settings evaluation delay.png](/img/monitors/additional-settings-evaluation-delay.png)

    If your data is coming from the [Amazon CloudWatch Source for Metrics](/docs/send-data/hosted-collectors/amazon-aws/amazon-cloudwatch-source-metrics.md) we recommend a setting of 900 seconds.

1. (Optional) Set **Notifications**, when a trigger condition is met you can send notifications to other people and services. To add notifications click on the **Add Notification** button. You can add more than one notification channel for a Monitor.

    ![monitor notifications input.png](/img/monitors/monitor-notifications-input.png)

    Metric Monitors have an option to send notifications either as a group or separately. **Group Notifications** define whether you want single notifications per time series that match the Monitor query or you want group notifications where you receive a single notification for the entire Monitor. Log Monitors always group notifications.

   1. The **Connection Type** specifies the notification channel where you want to get notified, such as an email or webhook. See [Connections](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections) for details.  Monitor notifications support variables to reference its configuration settings or your raw data. See [alert variables](/docs/alerts/monitors/alert-variables) for a table of the available variables.

      * **Email**: Provide 1-100 recipient email addresses. You can customize the email subject and body.
      * **Webhook**: By default, the payload defined on the Connection is used. You can customize your payload for each notification if needed.

   1. Select the **Alert** and **Recovery** checkboxes for each trigger type based on when you want to send a notification.  You can have different Trigger Conditions send a notification to different channels. For example, you can get notified on PagerDuty for critical Incidents and get an email or Slack notification for warning incidents.

        :::tip
        See the [Notifications section](#notifications) for details on alert and recovery notifications.
        :::

        If your connection type is Lambda, Microsoft Teams, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, Slack, or a generic webhook the **Recovery** checkbox enables an automatic resolution process that updates the connection when an alert has recovered within Sumo Logic. Support for other connection types is coming soon.

   1. **Add Notifications** to add additional notification channels as needed. You can configure different notifications for each trigger type, critical, warning, and missing data.

1. Enter a **Name** for the Monitor and the **Location** you want it saved to. A **Description** is optional.

1. **Playbooks** allow admins to codify tribal knowledge for an on-call so they know what exactly to do when they receive an alert. You have the option to provide a playbook when creating a Monitor, as shown in the below image. Markdown is supported.

1. Click the **Save** button at the top right of the panel when you're finished configuring the Monitor.
