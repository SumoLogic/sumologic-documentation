Sumo Logic offers several alerting features. See the topics below for details on how they work and your configuration options.

You can configure Sumo Logic Monitors using [Terraform modules](https://github.com/SumoLogic/terraform-sumologic-sumo-logic-monitor).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

See the following options to view and modify settings for dashboards:

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
