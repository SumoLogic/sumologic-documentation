# Does Sumo Logic let me get alerts from a specific static IP address?

Yes, Sumo Logic provides webhook notifications through static IP addresses. You can allowlist those IP addresses to receive notifications directly from Sumo Logic. For a list of our allowlist addresses, contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/hc/en-us).

:::note
The [**Test Connection** feature for webhooks](/docs/alerts/webhook-connections/set-up-webhook-connections) does not use the same static IP addresses that send notifications, it uses different temporary IP addresses.
