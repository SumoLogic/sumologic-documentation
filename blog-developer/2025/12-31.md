### April 9, 2025 - Deprecation of Sumo Logic India Data Center

As previously communicated to impacted customers, effective as of April 30, 2025, customers will no longer be able to ingest data into the Sumo Logic Mumbai data center (`https://api.in.sumologic.com/`). Customers will retain access to historical data and basic search functionality until April 30, 2026, at which point all access will be terminated.

Historical data will not be migrated to other deployments.

**Reminder**: If you're still referencing the India endpoint, please update your integrations. For supported alternatives, see the [endpoint guide](/docs/api/about-apis/getting-started/#sumo-logic-endpoints-by-deployment-and-firewall-security).

For help, contact [Support](https://support.sumologic.com/).
