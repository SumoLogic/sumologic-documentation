<description>
<![CDATA[ Update - We’re making some architectural changes to the Sumo Logic Metrics Engine to support on-going functionality and scalability improvements. The changes may have some impact on query language semantics for queries that use aggregation or reducer operators. <br /><br /> For aggregation queries, the changes are limited to the metadata used to label the metric dimension in the Preview Table in the Metrics Explorer, and in the chart legend. For queries with reducer functions–eval, filter, topk, bottomk–there may be a slight difference in how we quantize the metric data. The engine updates will be rolled out starting on June 13th, 2022. For information how the updates might affect existing metrics queries, and how you can update existing queries to avoid any impact, see <a href="/Metrics/Metric-Queries-and-Alerts/01Metrics_Engine_Updates" title="Metrics Engine Updates">Metrics Engine Updates</a>. ]]>

<![CDATA[ We are proud to announce general availability of extended trace filtering capabilities. This allows you to search for traces by any existing and new metadata, including your custom ones without a need to add this to the configuration or knowing this upfront, before you start ingesting data. Just add any metadata tag to your spans and, as long as its cardinality within a trace is not too high, you will be able to filter by it right away in your Traces UI. ]]>

<![CDATA[ Update - We have resolved a discrepancy in the notification payload of Real Time Scheduled Searches.<br />Previously, the payload for subsequent real time alerts in a given time range would incrementally report the results and omit the records that were already present in the previous alert.<br />For example, if the Scheduled Search initially returned 10 records, the first alert notification would contain 10 records in the payload. If the next run contained the same 10 records plus 1 additional, the notification payload would only contain the single new record.<br />Going forward, we will ensure that the records sent in the notification payload will always contain all the records returned in the Scheduled Search. Following the above example, the next run of the Real Time Scheduled Search would return 11 records. This change ensures that the payload will always match the results of the search in Sumo Logic. ]]>

<![CDATA[ New - We're thrilled to announce our new Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework.<br />The Cloud-to-Cloud Integration framework is an extensible system for running fully hosted, pull, and pub-sub based sources. Traditionally, Sumo Logic collection has been push-based, where we expose an endpoint to which data sources or collector agents push data to us. However, many SaaS applications and Cloud Providers expose event data that describe user, system/application activity which is critical for operations monitoring, security, and compliance use cases. The Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework is the system by which we provide integrations to these sources and SaaS applications.<br />This release comes with two new Sources, Okta and Netskope. Our existing apps are updated to work with these two new Sources. ]]>
