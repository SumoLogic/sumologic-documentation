OpenTelemetry is the future of agent-based collection for Sumo Logic and the Sumo Logic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector is our next generation collector built on OpenTelemetry. It provides a single unified agent to send Logs, Metrics, Traces, and Metadata for Observability to Sumo Logic.

You can also see the [OT Distro GitHub repository](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector#readme) for detailed instructions on how to configure and migrate your existing collection.
